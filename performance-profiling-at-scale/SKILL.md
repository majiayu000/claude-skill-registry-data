# Performance Profiling at Scale (React 18)

## Summary

Conduct rigorous, statistically grounded performance profiling for large React applications.

## Key Capabilities

- Isolate render hotspots via flame graphs and commit profiling.
- Use synthetic benchmarks to identify tail-latency regressions.
- Quantify memoization impact with variance-aware metrics.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Design controlled experiments with confounding factors minimized.
- Use A/B benchmarking with statistical significance thresholds.
- Build performance budgets tied to user-centric KPIs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Provide profiling artifacts and a root-cause analysis.
- Show measurable improvements in p95/p99 render times.
- Document a reproducible profiling protocol.
