# Humanizer: Remove AI Writing Patterns

Identify and remove signs of AI-generated text to make writing sound natural and human. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide (WikiProject AI Cleanup), derived from observations of thousands of AI-generated text instances.

**Key insight:** LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely completion - that's how telltale patterns get baked in.

## Triggers

Load this skill when the user asks to:
- "humanize", "de-AI", "de-slop", or "make this sound like a person wrote it"
- rewrite something so it doesn't sound LLM-generated
- edit a draft (blog post, essay, PR description, docs, email, resume bullet) to sound more natural
- match their voice in something they're producing
- review text for AI tells before publishing

Also apply to **your own** output when writing user-facing prose - release notes, PR descriptions, documentation, long-form explanations.

## Input modes

1. **Inline** - user pastes text directly. Work on it in-place, reply with the rewrite.
2. **File** - use `file_read` to load it, then `file_write` (full rewrite) or a targeted patch per section. Always show the user what changed.
3. **Voice sample** - user provides a writing sample for voice matching. Read the sample first (see Voice Calibration below), then rewrite.

## Procedure

1. **Identify** - scan for the 29 patterns catalogued below.
2. **Rewrite** - replace AI-isms with natural alternatives.
3. **Preserve meaning** - keep the core message intact.
4. **Match voice** - formal, casual, technical, etc. If a sample was provided, match it specifically.
5. **Add soul** - don't just remove bad patterns; inject personality (see PERSONALITY AND SOUL).
6. **Final audit** - ask yourself: "What makes this so obviously AI-generated?" Note remaining tells, then revise one more time.
7. **File output** - if the text came from a file, write back with `file_write` and summarize changes.

## Voice Calibration (optional)

If the user provides a writing sample, analyze before rewriting:
- Sentence length patterns (short/punchy? long/flowing? mixed?)
- Word choice level (casual, academic, somewhere between?)
- How they start paragraphs
- Punctuation habits (dashes, parenthetical asides, semicolons?)
- Recurring phrases or verbal tics
- Transition style (explicit connectors vs. just starting the next point)

Match those patterns in the rewrite - don't just remove AI patterns, replace them with the user's patterns. Without a sample, fall back to the default voice from PERSONALITY AND SOUL.

**Providing a sample:**
- Inline: "Humanize this. Here's a sample of my writing: [sample]"
- File: "Humanize this. Use my style from [path] as reference."

## PERSONALITY AND SOUL

Sterile, voiceless writing is as obvious as slop. Good writing has a human behind it.

**Signs of soulless writing (even if technically "clean"):**
- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No first-person perspective when appropriate
- No humor, no edge, no personality

**How to add voice:**
- **Have opinions.** React to facts, don't just report them.
- **Vary rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time.
- **Acknowledge complexity.** "This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "This is impressive."
- **Use "I" when it fits.** "I keep coming back to..." signals a real person thinking.
- **Let some mess in.** Tangents and asides are human. Perfect structure feels algorithmic.
- **Be specific about feelings.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning at 3am while nobody's watching."
