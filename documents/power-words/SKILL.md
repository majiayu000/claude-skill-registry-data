## Enhancement Process

### Step 1: Identify Current Copy Weakness
- Bland verbs? (get, have, make)
- Generic adjectives? (good, great, nice)
- Passive voice?
- No emotional hook?

### Step 2: Match Emotion to Goal

| Goal | Primary Category | Secondary |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| Sales/Conversion | Greed, Urgency | Exclusivity |
| Trust/Authority | Authority | Completeness |
| Engagement | Novelty | Mind-blowing |
| Fear-based | Safety, Sadness | Savagery |
| Desire-based | Lust, Beauty | Prestige |
| FOMO | Exclusivity | Impatience |

### Step 3: Strategic Replacement

**Rule of 3:** Use 2-3 power words per headline or CTA. More feels forced.

**Placement priority:**
1. First 3 words (hook)
2. Last word (memory anchor)
3. Action word (CTA verb)

## Output Format

```markdown
