# research-and-ingest

This skill is invoked by `research-scout` to fetch external content in a
disciplined way. The output of this skill is two artifacts: raw
snapshots in `docs/graph/sources/raw/` (when license allows) and
normalized summaries in `docs/graph/sources/normalized/`, plus a row in
`docs/graph/sources/index.md`. The wiki page (created by `library-wiki`)
draws from these.

## When to apply this skill

- A new dependency is being evaluated or added.
- A wiki page's "Last reviewed" date is older than the project's review
  cadence, or its pin no longer matches the lockfile.
- An ADR is being written and needs current evidence.
- An LLM/VLM feature is being designed and needs the provider's current
  behavior documentation.
- A spec is being authored and refers to a standard (RFC, schema,
  protocol) the project hasn't read recently.

## Source ranking

When two sources disagree, prefer in this order:
1. Official upstream documentation for the exact version in use.
2. Official upstream source code (especially public API surface,
   examples directory, CHANGELOG).
3. Official upstream blog posts and migration guides.
4. Security advisories from trusted bodies (CVE, CISA, OWASP, official
   upstream advisories).
5. Well-maintained community resources with current dates.
6. Recent blog posts from credible authors.
7. Anything else, marked clearly with reliability `community` or
   `mirror`.

Verify a forum answer older than a year against current docs before
citing it for a fast-moving library, and test any forum answer before it
enters the wiki.

## Workflow (per source)

### 1. Identify

For each source you intend to ingest, note:
- Authority (who maintains it).
- Version coverage (which versions of the library/spec it covers).
- Date (when it was last updated upstream).
- License (whether snapshotting is allowed).
- Slug (the filename you'll use locally).

### 2. Fetch

Use the host tool's web-fetch capability. Ingest paywalled or
login-walled content only with the user's explicit OK, because its
access terms bind the project. If a documentation MCP server is
configured (Context7, DeepWiki, `llms.txt` provider, similar), prefer it
for fast, version-aware retrieval.

### 3. Snapshot (when allowed)

When the license permits, write the raw content to
`docs/graph/sources/raw/<slug>-<retrieved-date>.<ext>`. Acceptable
extensions: `.md`, `.html`, `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.json`. Keep the raw file
whole, to preserve provenance. When the license does not permit a
snapshot, link to the source and store no copy; when the host retrieved
through an MCP summary and holds no page to keep, there is none to
store. Either way, say so in the `raw:` line of the normalized metadata
block. A snapshot with neither the raw file nor the reason is
`UNJUSTIFIED` at the coverage gate: the reason recorded is what makes
the omission a decision instead of a habit.

### 4. Normalize

Produce `docs/graph/sources/normalized/<slug>.md`:
- Clean Markdown holding the upstream headings and the decision-relevant
  content only (navigation chrome, ads, tracking pixels and boilerplate
  footers go).
- At the top, the metadata block:

```markdown
---
source-title: <title>
source-url: <url>
source-maintainer: <name>
source-version-coverage: <e.g. "1.4 - 1.6">
retrieved: YYYY-MM-DD
license: <SPDX or "see source">
raw: raw/<slug>-<retrieved-date>.<ext> | withheld — <why: the license, a host without fetch, an MCP summary with no page behind it>
reliability: official | community-trusted | community | mirror
---
```

### 5. Register

Add a row to `docs/graph/sources/index.md`:

```
| <title> | <url> | <maintainer> | YYYY-MM-DD | <version> | <reliability> | <relevance> | <one-line notes> |
```

### 6. Draft, then hand back

Draft the wiki page from the normalized sources (`skill.library-wiki`
says what each section owes) and end the turn with the handback payload
naming the page, the sources index rows, and `tester` as
`recommended_next` for the smoke test. The scout is a leaf; the
authoring-class `docs-librarian` finalizes the page in the close-out,
the phase order being `ingest-library.flow`'s.

## Documentation MCP servers (when available)

If the project has any of these configured, prefer them for fetching
upstream content:

- **Context7** (`@upstash/context7-mcp`): current docs for many
  libraries, addressable by library ID and version. Use the library-ID
  form for precision.
- **DeepWiki**: open-source repository summaries.
- **`llms.txt` providers**: projects that publish a machine-readable
  docs index.

When you use one, cite the source in the normalized file's metadata with
the MCP server name and the date.

The local wiki is still authoritative for the project. The MCP server
gets you upstream content faster; the wiki page is your distillation of
what this project actually does with that content.

## Disagreement handling

If two sources disagree:
1. Note the version coverage of each.
2. Prefer the more recent official source.
3. If a security advisory disagrees with the docs, the advisory wins.
4. If the disagreement persists, record both with their versions in the
   wiki page, and open a question in grill.md §12.

For a non-trivial topic, cross-check against the upstream source code as
well, because one source per topic leaves a disagreement nobody can see.

## Source reconciliation (lightweight drift check)

Between full research passes, run a cheap periodic reconciliation: diff
the currently-resolved dependency versions and manifests/locks against
the versions recorded in the library wiki, using only what already
resolves locally. Classify each line:

- **no mismatch**: the wiki pin still matches what resolves; nothing to
  do.
- **refresh before the next API-affecting change**: the pin has drifted
  but no work is about to touch that surface; flag it, and re-ingest
  when work next touches that surface.
- **superseded — treat as historical**: the recorded version is gone
  from the resolved set; mark the wiki content as historical.

This catches silent pin drift that accumulates between full passes, at a
fraction of the cost. It is distinct from a full research pass (which
re-fetches and re-normalizes upstream content) and from
`validate-knowledge` (which tests whether the wiki *prose* is navigable
and correct, not whether its pins are still current).
