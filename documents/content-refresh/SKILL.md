# Content Refresh Workflow

Re-optimize existing content with updated research, current statistics, new sources, refreshed SEO keywords, and Phase 6.5 humanization — while preserving what's working and maintaining search rankings.

## When to Use

Use `/contentforge:content-refresh` when:
- Content is 6+ months old and needs updated stats/examples
- Search rankings are declining (lost top 10 position)
- Competitor content has surpassed yours
- Product/service features have changed
- Industry landscape has shifted
- Content scored well originally (≥7.0) but needs freshening

## What This Command Does

1. **Load Existing Content** — Read the current .docx from wherever the brand's `tracking.backend` stores it (local filesystem, Airtable attachment, or Google Drive)
2. **Analyze What to Keep** — Identify evergreen sections, high-performing segments
3. **Research Updates** — Find current statistics, new sources, recent examples
4. **Selective Rewrite** — Update outdated sections, preserve working content
5. **Re-run Quality Gates** — Fact-check new claims, re-humanize, re-score
6. **SEO Preservation** — Maintain target keywords, internal links, meta structure
7. **Version Control** — Save as v1.1, v1.2 (never overwrite v1.0)

## Required Inputs

**Existing Content:**
- Google Drive URL or File ID
- OR: Local .docx file path

**Refresh Scope (select one):**
- **Light Refresh** (20%): Update statistics, examples, citations only
- **Medium Refresh** (50%): Rewrite intro/conclusion, update 3-5 sections, add new research
- **Heavy Refresh** (80%): Complete rewrite using original as outline, keep only evergreen insights

**Optional:**
- New target keywords (if pivoting focus)
- Sections to preserve (mark as "DO NOT EDIT")
- Deadline (for priority ranking in batch)

## How to Use

### Basic Usage
```
/contentforge:content-refresh https://docs.google.com/document/d/XYZ123
```
**Prompt:** "What refresh scope? (light / medium / heavy)"

### With Scope Specified
```
/contentforge:content-refresh https://docs.google.com/document/d/XYZ123 --scope=medium
```

### Batch Refresh (multiple pieces)
Run the refresh sheet through `/contentforge:batch-process` — point it at a sheet whose rows reference existing documents:
```
/contentforge:batch-process https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ABC123
```
Sheet columns: `doc_url`, `refresh_scope`, `priority`

## What Happens

### Step 1: Content Analysis (2-3 minutes)
- Load existing content from Google Drive
- Extract metadata (original publish date, current word count, quality score)
- Identify sections: intro, body paragraphs, conclusion, citations
- **Evergreen Detection**: Flag sections that are timeless (definitions, principles, frameworks)
- **Outdated Detection**: Flag statistics >12 months old, broken links, deprecated examples
- Calculate "freshness score" (0-100, based on %outdated)

**Output:**
```
Content Analysis Report
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Title: "AI in Healthcare: 2025 Trends and Predictions"
Original Publish: 2025-03-15
Current Word Count: 2,340 words
Original Quality Score: 8.9/10

Freshness Score: 42/100 (Needs Refresh)

Evergreen Sections (Keep):
✓ Para 2: Definition of AI in healthcare
✓ Para 5: Historical context (2010-2020)
✓ Para 8: Ethical considerations framework

Outdated Sections (Update):
⚠ Para 1: Intro references "2025 predictions" (now outdated)
⚠ Para 3: Statistics from 2024 market report
⚠ Para 6: Example of startup acquired in 2025
⚠ Para 10: Conclusion mentions "upcoming 2025 regulations"
⚠ Citations: 6/15 links are broken (404 errors)

Recommendation: Medium Refresh (50% rewrite)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Step 2: Research Phase (Targeted)
- Run Phase 1 (Research Agent) focused ONLY on outdated sections
- Search for: Current statistics (2026), new case studies, recent regulatory changes
- Find replacement sources for broken citations
- **Preserve existing sources** for evergreen content

### Step 3: Selective Rewrite
- **Keep evergreen sections unchanged** (no rewrite)
- **Update outdated sections** with new research
- **Rewrite intro/conclusion** to reflect current year, updated predictions
- **Maintain article structure** (same H2/H3 hierarchy)
- **Preserve internal links** and brand-specific terminology

### Step 4: Re-run Quality Pipelines
- **Phase 2 (Fact-Checker)**: Verify ONLY new claims and updated statistics
- **Phase 4 (Validator)**: Check for hallucinations in rewritten sections
- **Phase 5 (Structurer)**: Ensure refreshed content flows naturally with preserved sections
- **Phase 6 (SEO)**: Preserve the original keyword **placements** (title, H1, first 100 words, 2-3 H2s, conclusion) and meta structure. Density is monitored for drift and reported — it is advisory, never a target to pad toward.
- **Phase 6.5 (Humanizer)**: Re-humanize rewritten sections
- **Phase 7 (Reviewer)**: Re-score (target: ±0.5 points from original score)

### Step 5: Version Control
- Original: `Article-AI-Healthcare_v1.0.docx` (never modified)
- Refresh: `Article-AI-Healthcare_v1.1.docx` (new version)
- Track changes in metadata: "Refreshed 2026-02-17, updated 6 sections, added 4 new sources"

## Refresh Scopes

### Light Refresh (~20% rewrite, 8-12 min)
**What Changes:**
- Update statistics to current year
- Replace 1-2 outdated examples
- Fix broken citation links
- Refresh intro sentence ("As of 2026..." instead of "In 2025...")
- Re-run Phase 6.5 Humanizer only

**What Stays:**
- All structure (H2/H3 headings)
- 80% of original paragraphs
- All evergreen sections
- Target keywords unchanged

**Use Case:** Content is 6-12 months old, mostly accurate, just needs stats updated

### Medium Refresh (~50% rewrite, 15-20 min)
**What Changes:**
- Rewrite intro and conclusion completely
- Update 40-60% of body paragraphs
- Add 3-5 new sections for emerging trends
- Replace 50% of citations with current sources
- Re-run Phases 2, 4, 5, 6, 6.5, 7

**What Stays:**
- Article structure (same H2 sections, order may change)
- Evergreen definitions, frameworks, principles
- Target keywords (may add 2-3 new secondary keywords)

**Use Case:** Content is 12-24 months old, core thesis is valid but needs significant updates

### Heavy Refresh (~80% rewrite, 22-30 min)
**What Changes:**
- Complete rewrite using original as outline only
- New research from scratch (Phase 1 full run)
- Update target keywords based on current search intent
- Add 5-10 new sections
- Replace 80% of citations
- Full 10-phase pipeline (same as new content)

**What Stays:**
- Core topic and brand voice
- 1-2 evergreen sections (definitions, historical context)
- SEO URL slug (to preserve backlinks)

**Use Case:** Content is 24+ months old, industry has changed significantly, needs near-complete overhaul

## SEO Preservation Strategies

### Keyword Density Maintenance
```
Original keyword density: 2.3% for "AI in healthcare"
Target for refresh: 2.0-2.6% (±0.3%)
Action: Phase 6 monitors and adjusts rewritten sections
```

### URL Slug Preservation
```
Original: /blog/ai-in-healthcare-2025-trends
Refreshed: /blog/ai-in-healthcare-2025-trends (SAME URL)
Title updates to: "AI in Healthcare: 2026 Trends and Predictions"
```

### Internal Link Preservation
- All internal links from original content are preserved
- Add new internal links to related updated content
- Never break existing internal link structure

### Meta Description Update
```
Original: "Explore AI in healthcare trends for 2025..."
Refreshed: "Explore AI in healthcare trends for 2026..." (year updated)
```

## Quality Scoring (Refresh vs. Original)

**Target:** Refresh score should be within ±0.5 points of original

**Example:**
- Original: 8.9/10 (Content Quality: 9.2, Citations: 8.5, Brand: 9.0, SEO: 8.8, Readability: 9.0)
- Refreshed: 9.1/10 (Content Quality: 9.3, Citations: 9.0, Brand: 9.0, SEO: 8.9, Readability: 9.2)
- **Result: ✓ Within acceptable range** (+0.2 improvement)

**If refresh scores <8.4** (<0.5 below original):
- Flag for human review
- Identify which dimension dropped (likely Citations or SEO)
- Rerun Phase 2 (Fact-Checker) or Phase 6 (SEO Optimizer)

## Batch Content Refresh

### Use Case: Quarterly Content Audit
Agency has 50 blog posts, wants to refresh top 20 performers that are 12+ months old.

**Step 1: Prepare Refresh Sheet**
```csv
doc_url,refresh_scope,priority,notes
https://docs.google.com/.../article-1,medium,1,Rankings dropped from #3 to #7
https://docs.google.com/.../article-2,light,2,Just needs stat updates
https://docs.google.com/.../article-3,heavy,3,Topic outdated, needs rewrite
...
```

**Step 2: Run Batch Refresh**
```
/contentforge:batch-process https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ABC123
```

**Step 3: Process (standard batch orchestration)**
- **Sequential — one refresh pipeline at a time.** There is no concurrency.
- Queue order is set by the `priority` column
- Every phase of every piece is checkpointed, so an interrupted batch resumes where it stopped rather than restarting
- Completion report with before/after scores

Total time scales roughly with the number of pieces and their refresh scope; batching buys queue management and resumability, not a speedup.

## Integration with Other Skills

**Before Refresh:**
- `/contentforge:cf-audit` — Identify which content needs refreshing (freshness scores, declining candidates). **v4.0 file contract:** when the user says "refresh what the audit found" (or `--from-audit`), read the recorded candidates rather than remembering them:
  ```bash
  python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/audit-ledger.py latest --brand <slug>
  ```
  Take `pieces` ranked by `refresh_priority`; each row's `recommended_scope` (light/medium/heavy/retire) is this skill's scope input. Exit 1 means no recorded audit exists — say so and point at `/contentforge:cf-audit`; never invent candidates.
- `/contentforge:cf-brief` — Re-run keyword + competitor research on the topic to see what the SERP now rewards and what competitors have added since you published

**After Refresh:**
- `/contentforge:publish` — Push updated content to WordPress/Webflow
- `/contentforge:cf-analytics` — Track refresh quality scores over time

## Limitations

- Content not originally created by ContentForge has **no baseline quality score**, so the refresh is graded absolutely rather than as a delta — the "±0.5 of original" criterion below does not apply to imported pieces handed over from `/contentforge:cf-audit`
- Heavy Refresh (80%) is almost same time as new content (use sparingly)
- Requires the original .docx to be retrievable from the brand's configured tracking backend (can't refresh from published URLs alone)

## Success Criteria

**Good Refresh:**
- Quality score within ±0.5 of original
- Freshness score improves to 85-100
- All broken links fixed
- Keyword placements preserved (density drift reported as advisory)
- SEO rankings stable or improve within 2-4 weeks

**Bad Refresh (requires redo):**
- Quality score drops >1.0 point
- A keyword placement slot (title, H1, first 100 words, H2s, conclusion) lost its primary keyword
- Internal links broken
- Brand voice inconsistency

## Agents Used

The refresh reuses the canonical 10-phase pipeline agents (Reviewer is Phase 7, Output Manager is Phase 8):

- **Heavy Refresh** — full pipeline, same as new content (Step 0.5 + Phases 1-8)
- **Medium Refresh** — Phases 2 (Fact-Checker), 4 (Scientific Validator), 5 (Structurer), 6 (SEO/AEO/GEO), 6.5 (Humanizer), 7 (Reviewer), 8 (Output Manager)
- **Light Refresh** — Phases 6.5 (Humanizer), 7 (Reviewer), 8 (Output Manager)

## Related Skills

- `/contentforge:batch-process` — Create or refresh content as a sequential, checkpointed queue
- `/contentforge:cf-variants` — A/B test refreshed vs. original elements
- `/contentforge:cf-audit` — Find refresh candidates across the whole library

**Value:** Preserves SEO equity (URL, internal links, keyword placements) while extending content lifespan
