# Experience System Blueprint Skill

## When to Use
- Creating scalable design systems anchored in brand strategy.
- Handing off brand concepts to product, web, or event teams.
- Auditing touchpoints for coherence and accessibility.

## Framework
1. **System Principles** – design tenets, accessibility standards, inclusivity commitments.
2. **Component Library** – modules for hero sections, CTAs, motion behaviors, environmental elements.
3. **Sensory Spec** – visual, motion, audio, haptics guidelines with do/don't examples.
4. **Channel Adaptations** – matrices showing how components flex by channel/device.
5. **QA & Measurement** – checklist + instrumentation hooks to track fidelity and impact.

## Templates
- Blueprint deck with principle → component → channel mapping.
- Figma/Notion doc outlining specs, tokens, and usage rules.
- QA worksheet for reviewing executions before launch.

## Tips
- Version-control blueprints so teams know which system is authoritative.
- Embed accessibility best practices early to avoid retrofits.
- Pair with `design-multi-channel-brand-experience` command for turnkey toolkits.
