# Economics and Finance Writing

Style guide for economics journal articles, working papers, and finance analysis based on Deirdre McCloskey's *Economical Writing*.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill for:
- Economics journal articles and working papers
- Finance analysis and market commentary
- Policy briefs and economic reports
- Editing economics/finance prose for clarity

**For general writing**: Use `/writing` skill (Strunk & White)
**For legal writing**: Use `/writing-legal` skill (Volokh)

## Core Principles

### Speak to One Reader

Choose an implied reader and stick with her. A skeptical but sympathetic colleague. Keep the prose at one level of difficulty. If it embarrasses you to imagine how she would read it, the stuff is embarrassing.

### Avoid Boilerplate

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| "This paper discusses..." | Bores the reader; use a hook instead |
| Table-of-contents paragraph | Readers skip it; they can't understand until they've read the paper |
| Background/padding | If you discovered it was beside the point, don't include it |
| "As we shall see" | Useless anticipation; the reader will see soon enough |
| Metric conversions every time | Shows you think the reader is an ignoramus |

Never repeat without apologizing ("as I said earlier"). If apologizing too much, you're repeating too much.

### Control Tone

- Avoid invective: "This is pure nonsense" arouses suspicion the argument is weak
- Delete every "very" and "absolutely" - most things aren't
- Use wit to compensate for strong opinions
- Relax the pose of The Scientist; write like a human being

### One Point Per Paragraph

End each paragraph with a simple, street-talk encapsulation. The paragraph can be technical as long as the last sentence comes down a notch. It makes the paragraph sing.

### Make Tables Self-Explanatory

The reader should understand the table without the main text. Use words in headings, not acronyms. "Logarithm of Domestic Price" not "LPDOM". Follow Tufte: no chart junk, have a point.

Use meaningful labels in equations: "Quantity of Grain = 3.56 + 5.6(Price of Grain)" not "Q = 3.56 + 5.6P where Q is..."

### Make Writing Cohere

Repeat key words to link sentences. (AB)(BC)(CD) is easy to understand. The figure is called polyptoton. English achieves coherence by repetition, not by "not only...but also" which marks you as incompetent.

## Word Choice

### Avoid Elegant Variation

Use one word to mean one thing. A paper used: "industrialization," "growing structural differentiation," "economic and social development," "development," "economic growth," "growth," and "revolutionized means of production" to mean the same thing. Don't.

When uncertain, look back and use the same word.

### Key Principles

| Principle | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Be concrete | "sheep and wheat" not "natural resource-oriented exports" |
| Untie Teutonisms | "equalization of the prices of factors" not "factor price equalization" |
| Avoid ersatz economics | Never use "skyrocketing," "fair prices," "vicious cycle," "exploit" |
| Avoid this-ism | Replace *this*, *these*, *those* with *the* |

See `references/economical-writing-full.md` for extended bad words list, Teutonism examples, and ersatz economics vocabulary.

## Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "This paper discusses X" | Hook the reader with the finding |
| Table-of-contents paragraph | Delete it; readers skip it anyway |
| "As we shall see" | Delete; anticipation is useless |
| Elegant variation | Use the same word for the same thing |
| Five-dollar words | Anglo-Saxon roots are more concrete |
| Noun pile-ups | Untie with "of" |
| This/that/these/those | Replace with "the" |
| "Not only...but also" | Just use "and" |
