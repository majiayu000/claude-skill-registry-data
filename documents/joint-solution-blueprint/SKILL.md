# Joint Solution Blueprint Skill

## When to Use
- Launching or refreshing a co-built integration or packaged service.
- Equipping field teams with architecture, value props, and proof points.
- Coordinating enablement across product, marketing, and partner teams.

## Framework
1. **Use Case Definition** – target persona, pain point, and success metrics.
2. **Architecture Overview** – system diagram, data flows, dependencies, security notes.
3. **Value Narrative** – customer outcomes, ROI proof, competitive differentiation.
4. **Go-To-Market Plays** – positioning, pricing principles, launch checklist, asset library.
5. **Support & Lifecycle** – roles, escalation paths, roadmap commitments.

## Templates
- One-page solution brief with messaging + CTA.
- Architecture diagram checklist.
- Launch plan with tasks, owners, and deadlines.

## Tips
- Keep diagrams simple enough for sales decks, with appendix for technical deep dives.
- Include customer stories or beta insights to increase credibility.
- Pair with `build-co-sell-playbook` so reps know how to pitch + progress deals.
