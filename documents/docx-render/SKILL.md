# DOCX → PDF/PNG rendering

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

Office docs → PDF/PNG go through the shared converter `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/doc_render.py`
(`convert()`), which picks the best engine and applies the right fixes. **Do not
hand-roll `soffice`/`libreoffice` or lean on the generic `docx` skill's own
export** — those skip the Word-fidelity path and the x2t kerning/table fixes.

## Default to `--renderer word` (Iron Law)

**For any PDF a human will read — a deliverable, an email attachment, a reading-list
file, anything you hand to the user — pass `--renderer word`.** The bare/`auto`
command is NOT the safe default: `auto` deliberately EXCLUDES Word (the check is
`if avail["word"] and allow_word`, and `allow_word` defaults False) and silently
uses x2t/LibreOffice, which **reflow the layout** (real case: a 5-page doc shipped
as 7). Word works even from a background/headless job via cmux dispatch (below), so
there is no reason to skip it for a deliverable.

Reserve bare `auto` for **parallel pipeline builds** (e.g. many law-review renders
at once) where headless/parallel-safety matters more than line-exact fidelity and
the docs are pipeline-generated (x2t/soffice already grid-faithful there).

**On Linux, `--renderer word` cannot work** — it drives `Word.app` through
AppleEvents. Use **`--renderer word-remote`** instead: the same real Word engine
in a Windows guest, driven over SSH. See "Word in a Windows guest" below.

**Always verify the engine actually used** via the PDF Producer before handing off
(see table below) — `auto` can fall back, and `--renderer word` only *raises* if
Word is truly unavailable.

## A legacy `.doc` goes STRAIGHT to Word — never convert it first

Both Word engines open `.doc` natively, and `WORD_SRC_SUFFIXES` admits it:

```bash
python3 scripts/doc_render.py IN.doc OUT.pdf --renderer word-remote
```

**Never `soffice --convert-to docx` a `.doc` and render the result.** That hop
silently corrupts the document, and because the damage is in the intermediate it
survives into a genuine Word render, so the Producer string still says Word and
the output still looks authoritative. Measured on a 23-page expert report:

- **every footnote gained a stray superscript `?`** — soffice writes the real
  `<w:footnoteRef/>` and then a literal `<w:t>?</w:t>` run beside it, where the
  legacy footnote mark used to be;
- **the page count grew by one** (23 → 24), so pagination no longer matched what
  the sender saw.

Rendering the `.doc` itself reproduced the sender's 23 pages with clean footnote
numbers. If a `?` opens every footnote, suspect the conversion, not the sender.

**A wrong extension fails silently.** Word dispatches on the suffix, so a `.doc`
staged under a `.docx` name makes it bail: the guest's scheduled task completes,
writes no PDF, and the only symptom is `guest render did not complete`. The
transport carries the real suffix through — keep it that way.

## Entry point

```bash
# CLI (faithful Word engine — DEFAULT for anything a human reads):
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/doc_render.py IN.docx OUT.pdf --renderer word
# auto engine (LibreOffice/x2t; NO Word) — ONLY for parallel pipeline builds:
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/doc_render.py IN.docx OUT.pdf
```
```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "<plugin>/scripts")
from doc_render import convert
convert("in.docx", "out.pdf", renderer="word", allow_word=True)   # gold standard
convert("in.docx", "out.pdf")                                     # auto (headless)
```

**Agents without the `Skill` tool** (most workflow subagents): run the CLI above
directly — you don't need to invoke this skill, just call `doc_render.py`.

## Which engine, and why it matters

| Engine | Fidelity | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Word** (`--renderer word`) | gold standard | native layout; **only engine that keeps an auto-wrapping table as a grid** in a *hand-authored* docx (LibreOffice collapses it to a stacked column). Recomputes Word fields (REF/NOTEREF/PAGEREF/TOC). **macOS only** — it drives `Word.app` over AppleEvents. |
| **word-remote** (`--renderer word-remote`) | gold standard | the same real Word engine, in a QEMU Windows guest over SSH. **The Word path on Linux**, where `--renderer word` cannot work at all. Also usable from macOS against a guest on that host. |
| **x2t** | good | OOXML-native; correct per-section footnote restart; doc_render injects GPOS/kern + EB-Garamond so it matches. |
| **LibreOffice** | good *except* | wrong for per-section/page footnote restart; collapses auto-wrapping tables not pre-broken upstream. |

`convert()` auto-falls-back Word → x2t/soffice. **Verify which ran** via the PDF
Producer: `macOS … Quartz PDFContext` = Word; `LibreOffice …` = LibreOffice.

> **Garamond documents on macOS need a one-time setup.** x2t mis-measures the
> macOS (Monotype) Garamond *italic* face badly enough to cram every upright
> Garamond run. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup_garamond_render_override.py` writes a four-face
> override to `~/.config/x2t-render-fonts/garamond/` — macOS Garamond for
> regular/bold, EB Garamond for the slanted faces (`--all-eb` for the all-EB
> variant) — then `rm -rf ~/.cache/x2t-docfonts` to re-stage. Full measurements:

## Word from a background/headless job (the non-obvious part)

A detached Claude job is in a non-console GUI session without Word's TCC grant, so
direct AppleEvents fail with -600. `doc_render` transparently **dispatches the
render into a cmux pane** (console session, TCC-granted) and falls back to
x2t/LibreOffice if that's unavailable. Prereqs + full root-cause:
`docs/investigations/2026-06-22_word-render-cmux-dispatch.md`. Disable with
`$DOC_RENDER_NO_CMUX=1`.

### Driving the Mac's Word from another machine over SSH — doesn't work

The cmux rescue above assumes you are **on** the Mac. Invoking `--renderer word`
over SSH from another host (e.g. a Linux box rendering on `mbp`) fails
differently and has **no fallback** — cmux dispatch fails too, because there is
no console session on the far end to dispatch into:

```
doc_render: word renderer failed: Word direct render failed
  ([Errno 1] Operation not permitted:
   ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/wordrender/<uuid>);
  cmux dispatch also failed (…same…)
```

Note this is a **filesystem** permission error on Word's app container, not the
AppleEvents `-600` of the local case — an SSH session is outside the TCC grant
entirely. `launchctl asuser $(id -u) …` does **not** rescue it (`Could not
switch to audit session: Operation not permitted` — needs root).

Fixes, in order of preference:

1. **Use `word-remote`** (next section) — a Windows guest is the supported
   remote path; driving the Mac's Word from off-box is not.
2. Run the render from a terminal **inside the Mac's GUI login session** (then
   the normal local path, incl. cmux dispatch, applies).
3. Grant Full Disk Access to `/usr/libexec/sshd-keygen-wrapper` in System
   Settings → Privacy & Security, after which headless SSH renders work.

**Do not** paper over this by falling back silently — an explicit
`--renderer word` deliberately raises rather than downgrading.

## Word in a Windows guest (`word-remote`) — the Linux path

`--renderer word` is macOS-only. `word-remote` runs the same Word engine in a
Win11 guest and drives it over SSH, so Linux gets gold-standard fidelity:

```bash
python3 scripts/doc_render.py IN.docx OUT.pdf --renderer word-remote
```

Provisioned by the `programs.wordRender` nix module — `word-render` and
`word-render-install-fonts` on PATH, transport at
`~/.local/share/word-render/word_render_remote.sh` (override with
`$WORD_RENDER_REMOTE`). Full setup: `~/nix/modules/shared/word-render/README.md`.

**On Linux the guest is a docker container, not QEMU/qcow2.** `vm/start-winvm.sh`
and `~/.local/share/winvm/*.qcow2` are the **macOS** path. Linux uses
dockur/windows — the image Omarchy's `omarchy-windows-vm` drives — as container
`omarchy-windows`, disk at `~/.windows/data.img`, compose at
`~/.config/windows/docker-compose.yml`. There is no qcow2 to find here.

```bash
docker start omarchy-windows        # or: omarchy-windows-vm launch -k
until ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o BatchMode=yes word@winvm exit; do sleep 15; done
```

**A cold boot takes several minutes before sshd answers**, and the error changes
as it comes up: `Connection refused` (container down) → `Connection reset by
peer` / `timed out during banner exchange` (Windows still booting) → success.
Only the first means something is wrong. Wait on the `until` loop rather than
concluding the guest is broken; `docker logs --tail 20 omarchy-windows` shows
boot progress.

Selection rules:

- **Explicit** `--renderer word-remote` always runs it (and raises rather than
  falling back, like every explicit engine).
- **`auto` picks it only with `allow_word=True`**, and only when local Word is
  unavailable — i.e. it is the Linux stand-in for `renderer="word"`, preferred
  over the lower-fidelity engines rather than silently downgrading.
- **`auto` never reaches it in the fallback cascade.** Booting/using a VM is not
  something best-effort should do behind the caller's back.

Availability is a **file check on the transport script, not an SSH probe** — a
reachability test would cost a round-trip (and can hang on a suspended VM) on
every `convert()`. A down guest surfaces as a render error naming the fix.

**A fresh guest silently renders the wrong fonts.** Word substitutes
Cambria/Calibri for any font it can't resolve *and still exits 0*, so the render
"succeeds" with wrong typography. Run `word-render-install-fonts` once per
guest, then verify with `pdffonts` — never trust the exit code. (Stock
`lmodern` does not work: Word won't render CFF-flavoured OpenType, and it
matches families on name ID 1. The nix module ships a converted set.)

## Google Docs exports

A docx exported from Google Docs can carry OOXML package corruption (case-broken
`customXML` part paths) that makes Word pop a "recover unreadable content" modal
on open — fatal to a headless render. The Word path **auto-repairs** it via a
preflight (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/docx_repair.py`); you'll see `Word preflight — repaired
Google-export package …` on stderr. Repair a docx standalone with
`python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/docx_repair.py in.docx [out.docx]`.
