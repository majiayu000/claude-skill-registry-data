# elide-case — a court opinion cut into a student reading, on the work spine

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

**Typst rules in force here** — read the one that governs what you are writing; they are independent:
!`k=notes,prose; command -v typst-rules >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec typst-rules "$k"; r=$HOME/.claude/skills/typst/scripts/load-constraints; [ -x "$r" ] && exec "$r" "$k"; r=$HOME/projects/typst/scripts/load-constraints; [ -x "$r" ] && exec "$r" "$k"; echo "(typst corpus unavailable: NO Typst rule is listed here — install the typst plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

The lifecycle is [`work`](/home/eh/.claude/skills/workflows/skills/work/SKILL.md). Read it and
follow it. This file supplies `work`'s spine with the domain and nothing else — the three CLARIFY
questions, the plan grammar, the task rows, the two scored checks, the one mechanical entry point, the refs
and the authority text. **It ships no `workflow.js` and no `.js` of any kind**, and restates none of
`work`'s mechanics.

The domain rules live in `references/` and reach every dispatched agent through `refs`:

| ref | what it carries |
|---|---|
| [`references/authenticity.md`](references/authenticity.md) | the two Iron Laws — authentic reporter text, and compile-before-table |
| [`references/retrieval.md`](references/retrieval.md) | `workflows:westlaw` as the first route and the `.westlaw.docx` as the ONLY stored source, the corpus fallback (opinions vs RECAP, the 404, token gating, telling a clean source) and what that fallback's PDF cannot carry, and the two reasons to run on Gemini — a scanned source or a filter-tripping subject |
| [`references/editing-marks.md`](references/editing-marks.md) | one elision mark per addendum, `[ ]` conventions, never altering subject/tense/sentence boundary, the editors'-note rule (a note is the EXCEPTION, for background), where the mechanical conventions live (the preamble, once), the layout-only widow rule, and the source-mapping marker `// elide-source:` that check.sh reads |
| [`references/verification.md`](references/verification.md) | what each gate leg decides, and how to read a miss rate |

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
**The Iron Law of Authentic Text.** Every word of the excerpt is authentic reporter text, retrieved
this run and saved under `docs/`. Never drafted from memory, from a Teacher's Manual summary, or from
a casebook note. A plausible paraphrase handed to students as a quoted opinion is fabricated
authority in a course reader.

**The Iron Law of Compile-Before-Table.** The summary table is written AFTER the compile, from the
checker's computed output. Never before, never from an estimate.

Both are stated in full in `references/authenticity.md`, which is the `refs` entry every implementer
and the advisory fidelity reviewer must read. Refactoring this file never weakens them.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Phase 1 — CLARIFY: three questions, asked with AskUserQuestion, never self-answered

**This interview is the point of the workflow.** Ask exactly these three, with `AskUserQuestion`, and
record every answer verbatim in the plan:

1. **What is the doctrinal thread, in your own words — and which assigned reading does it cut
   against?** One thread, named by the instructor, plus the case or casebook page it is in tension
   with. This is what decides every sentence that survives the cut.
2. **Is this case taught for its HOLDING or for its REASONING?** Holding means the disposition and
   the rule statement survive and the analytical march may be compressed. Reasoning means the
   analytical steps survive and the disposition may be a sentence.
3. **What is the page target for each reading?** One MIN-MAX per reading, offered with **2-6 as the
   default** option — the skill's established range — since a reading whose length he does not care
   about takes the default. A lead case and a short blog post reasonably differ, which is why the
   plan carries one target per row. When the request or the schedule already gives a target,
   **pre-fill the options from it** rather than posing the question blind; nothing is inferred
   silently, and nothing is typed at a command line.

**Do not ask anything else.** On 2026-09-09 the instructor declined a passage he wants kept, and
declined insertion point and length as an interview axis — then **reversed the length half the same
day**: the per-reading page target is now question 3 above, set in the interview and enforced from
the plan, because a number typed at the command line is a number an agent can invent. Insertion point
and class number still come from the request, or off the schedule if the request omits them.

### THE INTERVIEW, AND EXACTLY WHAT ENFORCES IT

Never self-answer either question, never state an assumption and continue, never infer the thread
from the Teacher's Manual or from the case itself. `work`'s CLARIFY is conversational and **a
dispatched agent cannot call `AskUserQuestion`** — a run started from a farmed-out agent has nobody
to ask, and its only correct move is to stop and report that the interview is unanswered. Elevating
the run to a session that can reach the user is the fix; guessing is not.

Measured 2026-09-09: the old Phase 1 had the model state the doctrinal target *to itself*. It guessed
"pre-purchase efforts, against Life Partners", happened to be right, and nothing in the skill made it
ask. That silent-guess path is the defect this workflow exists to remove.

**The chain, with each link's real strength named.** Three things carry the interview, and only one of
them is software:

1. **The answers are recorded in the plan**, under `## Doctrinal target`, on the three labelled lines
   Phase 2 specifies.
2. **The instructor reads and approves that plan before the run arms**, and the spec hash binds what
   he approved. *This is the link that makes the answers his.* It is a human gate, and it is the only
   one there is: an instructor who approves a plan whose `## Doctrinal target` holds answers he never
   gave defeats the whole chain, and **no software in this design closes that.**
3. **`scripts/check.sh --plan <path>` refuses a plan whose section is missing or unfilled** — absent
   section, or `Doctrinal thread:` / `Cuts against:` missing, empty or a placeholder, or `Taught for:`
   missing or saying neither holding nor reasoning. The leg fails closed: passing neither `--plan` nor
   `--no-plan` is itself a FAIL naming the missing flag, and `--no-plan` (for fixture and dev runs
   that check an addendum alone) prints a loud NOT CHECKED line.

**What that leg proves, and what it does not.** It proves the section exists and every required answer
is non-empty. It is a backstop against an **orchestrator that skipped the question** — nothing more.
The plan file is written by the orchestrator, so no grep of it can tell the user's answers from the
orchestrator's own, and `work`'s `mechanicalChecks` run at gate time, *after* IMPLEMENT, so no
mechanical leg can refuse to proceed past CLARIFY. Do not close the gap with a second
`mechanicalChecks` entry — P10 refuses one, and the leg belongs inside the single entry point.

## Phase 2 — PLAN

`work`'s Phase 2. Domain requirements on the plan:

- **A `## Readings In Scope` section**, one row per reading: `caption | source docs/*.westlaw.docx (a docs/*.txt from an
  earlier run, or from the fallback route, still resolves) | page
  target`. **This section is the source of truth for the page target**, and the `--plan` leg enforces
  it exactly as it enforces the three Doctrinal target lines: an absent section, a row with no page
  target, or a placeholder one (`TBD`, `<…>`, `N/A`) FAILS the leg naming the offending row. The
  target is per reading, from interview question 3; `check.sh` maps each `.typ` caption to its row and
  passes that row's own MIN-MAX to `check-addendum.py`. The caption is the identifier the `.typ` and the mechanical entry point key on — the entry
  point derives its per-reading checks from the captions in the `.typ`. Each row also generates one
  `cut-<slug>` task, which is how a per-reading re-run reaches `work`'s `onlyTasks`.
- **The first two CLARIFY answers, quoted** (the third is the `page target` column above), under `## Doctrinal target`, on three labelled lines the
  `--plan` leg parses — `Doctrinal thread:`, `Cuts against:`, `Taught for:` (holding or reasoning).
  A placeholder (`TBD`, `<…>`, `N/A`) reads as absent and fails the leg.
- **A `## Non-court readings` section whenever a reading is not court text** — one `- <caption> —
  <why>` bullet each, and omitted entirely when every reading is an opinion. **Declaring a reading
  non-court text is the INSTRUCTOR's call, recorded in the plan, never a marker the implementer
  writes into the `.typ`**: a self-exempting marker would let fabricated text switch the verbatim
  check off on itself, which is the first Iron Law defeated by the file it governs. The quotes leg
  reads this list from `--plan` and reports those captions `DECLARED-UNCHECKED`; a
  `// elide-unchecked:` marker in the `.typ` is no longer honoured and its presence is itself a
  FAIL naming the reading.
- **Run sizing** naming the one mechanical entry point, the two `scoredChecks` keys on the `Scored
  checks:` line marked ADVISORY, the criteria/scope checklist on the `Review lens:` line, and the
  task rows. R readings give R + 2 tasks — one `retrieve`, R `cut-<slug>`, one `compile-table` — and
  2R scored items; with one lens and one mechanical check the floor is
  2(R + 2) + 1 + 1 + 2R = 4R + 6 agents — 10 for a single reading, 22 for four readings.
- **The wave assignment, stated**: `retrieve` in wave 1, every `cut-<slug>` in wave 2, `compile-table`
  in wave 3. `work-dispatch.sh` prints the wave graph it computes; if it does not match those three
  lines, the `dependsOn` edges are wrong, not the prose.

**Writable paths for a generated run are `addenda/`, `output/addenda/` and `docs/` only.** `notes/`,
`slides/` and `templates/` are excluded, and so is everything else in the course tree.

## Phase 3 — GOAL

`work`'s Phase 3, on the PASS phrasing: a run that writes can turn a FAIL into a PASS, and `work`'s
outer fix loop is what does it.

**Condition: `work-result.sh` returned 0 for the plan path, and the tuicr gate returned approved.**

```
/goal work-result.sh has returned 0 for <plansDirectory>/<slug>.md at its current hash, and the
tuicr gate has returned approved, or stop after N turns
```

Name the plan by **path**, never by a pinned digest — the FAIL loop amends and re-hashes the plan,
so a named hash self-invalidates. Name **`work-result.sh`'s exit code**, which is the run's verdict:
`overallPass` in `result.json` is not the verdict and must never be read directly (work/SKILL.md's
`mechanicalChecks` row). Naming the returned verdict is also what makes a gate FAIL reach a stopping
condition at all — including one carried by a lens finding, which otherwise reaches none.

The condition names **no legibility or fidelity finding**. A clause like *"no critical|major finding
survives"* would reinstate the non-terminating prose review this design exists to exclude: round
*n*'s fix gives round *n+1* new things to object to. Those two run as `scoredChecks`, which cannot
reach `overallPass` at all, so their output sits in `result.json` and is **retrievable** at Phase 5 by
a human who runs the command there. Nothing carries it to him. Both named verdicts get printed, so
both are judgeable from the transcript.

## Phase 4 — the work call

The args go in the plan's `<!-- work:dispatch -->` block and the dispatch is `work`'s own
`work-dispatch.sh` — never a hand-written `farm.sh --workflow` line, which drops the TIER 1
plan-lint gate and both probe gates:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/workflows/skills/work/scripts/work-dispatch.sh \
  --run-dir /home/eh/.local/state/work "$PLAN"     # ABSOLUTE — never the course tree
```

**Forward the provider.** A provider named in this skill's `$ARGUMENTS`, however it is spelled,
becomes `--provider codex` on that line. Omitting it runs the user's codex request on claude. The
content-filter facts that make this matter are in `references/retrieval.md`, alongside the other
reason a run belongs on `--provider gemini`: a source whose text came from OCR.

`--run-dir` is not optional: `work` resolves `.work/<run-id>` against `$PWD`, which on an elide run is
the course directory — a tree this run writes only `addenda/`, `output/addenda/` and `docs/` in.

The args object, complete as it stands.

**One task per reading, in three waves.** The `## Readings In Scope` table generates one `cut-<slug>`
row each — cut that reading and nothing else — above one shared `retrieve` row and below one
`compile-table` row. A second reading therefore adds exactly one task, and adds **no** lens and **no**
mechanical entry: the entry point derives its per-reading legs from the `.typ` itself. This
granularity is not cosmetic. It is what makes a per-reading re-run expressible in `work`'s own
vocabulary — see *The FAIL loop* below.

**The wave shape is forced by `work`'s disjointness rule, not chosen for tidiness.** Same-wave tasks
must have pairwise-disjoint `writablePaths`, checked prefix-aware and **refused at arg-validation,
before any agent is dispatched**. Every reading needs its source in `docs/`, so if each reading row
claimed `docs` they would all land in wave 1 claiming the same directory and a two-reading addendum
would be refused before dispatch. One row owns `docs/` instead:

| wave | rows | writable paths | why disjoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `retrieve` (one row, however many readings) | `docs` | alone in its wave |
| 2 | one `cut-<slug>` per reading, each `dependsOn: ["retrieve"]` | `addenda/NN-addendum-<slug>.typ` | one file each, slugs distinct |
| 3 | `compile-table`, `dependsOn` every `cut-<slug>` | `output/addenda`, `addenda/NN-addendum.typ` | alone in its wave |

`retrieve` writes `docs/` and nothing else; the cut rows read it and never write it. A single-reading
run keeps all three rows — collapsing them re-introduces the overlap the moment a second reading is
added.

`retrieve` stays one serial row (P17 exempted): every Westlaw export shares the user's one signed-in browser, one delivery queue whose top item `#0_qitem` is clicked, and one Downloads directory, so concurrent retrievals can take each other's file.

## Phase 5 — HUMAN REVIEW

`work`'s Phase 5, on the compiled PDF: the reviewer reads the reading, not the diff. Open the PDF
beside `human-review-gate.sh -w`.

### Where the legibility and fidelity scores actually are

**They are in `result.json` under `scores[]`, and nothing delivers them.** `work` returns each item's
computed score, its raw counts, and — because `passthrough` declared them — the verbatim offending
text under `evidence`. Phase 5 is a human step, so no exit code can compel anyone to look. Print them
with one command:

```bash
jq -r '.scores[] | "\(.key)  \(.item)  composite=\(.composite // "null")  itemsChecked=\(.itemsChecked // "n/a")  \(.reason // "")",
       "  components: \(.components // {} | tojson)",
       "  evidence:   \(.evidence   // {} | tojson)"' \
  /home/eh/.local/state/work/<run-id>/result.json
```

The field is `composite`, not `score` — `work` emits one `scores[]` entry per (key, item) pair as
`{key, item, components, composite, itemsChecked, evidence, reason?}`, and there is no cross-item
mean or total to read.

**This is an INSTRUCTION, not a gate, and the distinction is the whole design.** The scores cannot
fail the run by construction — that is exactly why they are `scoredChecks` and not the `lens` —
and therefore a reviewer who does not run that command does not see them. That is the accepted cost
of their not gating, and it is stated here rather than papered over with a sentence claiming they are
"reported".

**If that cost is unacceptable on a given run, the remedy is NOT to fold them into the `lens` prompt**
— that reinstates the non-terminating prose gate rule 9 forbids — it is for the instructor to read
the excerpt himself, which is what Phase 5 is for.

When the reviewer does want them in the findings file, write `result.json`'s `scores[]` there before
opening the PDF, one section per reading, naming the fields:

```
## Advisory scores — legibility and fidelity (these gate nothing)

### <caption>
legibility  composite <n>/10   itemsChecked <n>
  unparsable <n> · fusedElision <n> · danglingReferent <n> · unattributedQuote <n> · undefinedTermOfArt <n>
  evidence.offendingSentences:
    - "<verbatim sentence>"
fidelity    composite <n>/10   itemsChecked <n>
  quotedAsOwnReasoning <n> · unqualifiedHolding <n> · omittedAlternativeHolding <n> · dissentAsMajority <n>
  evidence.offendingPassages:
    - "<verbatim excerpt passage, and the source line it was traced to>"
```

Three rules on the rendering, because each is a way the output silently stops meaning anything:

- **`evidence.offendingSentences` and `evidence.offendingPassages` are the whole point of the
  passthrough declarations** — the counts say how many, the evidence says which. Render the verbatim
  text. A section showing counts with no evidence gives the reviewer nothing to act on.
- **A `null` `composite` is rendered as `null` WITH its stated `reason`** — never as `0`, never as a blank,
  never omitted. `null` means the item was unreliable or its agent died; `0` means it was measured
  and scored zero. Collapsing them turns "nothing checked this reading" into "this reading is bad",
  and the reviewer cannot tell.
- **`scores: []` with `scoresRun`/`scoresReported` as `null` is n/a, not clean.** Say the phase did
  not run rather than printing an empty section that reads as nothing found.

The reviewer decides what to do with all of it. A low score re-runs nothing by itself — see *The FAIL
loop*.

## The FAIL loop — `work`'s selectors, and where the per-reading granularity comes from

The selector is `work`'s own, all four channels, consumed together: `tasksThatFlagged`,
`mechanicalThatFailed`, `lensesThatFlagged` and `planFindings`. A scoped re-run is `onlyTasks` +
`priorResults`, derived by `work-redispatch.sh` from the result. **There is no caption channel** — `work` scopes by
task id and nothing else, so a re-run instruction phrased as "re-cut the failing caption" names a
dimension `work` does not have and cannot be executed.

**Per-reading re-cutting falls out of one task per reading, not out of any caption machinery.**
Because each reading is its own task row, a reading that fails puts its own id in `tasksThatFlagged`,
and `onlyTasks` re-runs exactly that reading. A four-reading addendum keeps the three readings the
gate already adjudicated — re-cutting them manufactures new surface for the next round.

`mechanicalThatFailed` names `elide-check`, whose leg lines name the failing reading. The lens routes
each failure to its owner task or to `plan`; task routes narrow the re-run, while `planFindings`
require amending and re-hashing the plan. Two domain rules on the fix, both in `references/verification.md`:

- A miss rate above roughly a quarter is the wrong source, not bad sentences. **Re-cut the reading
  from `docs/<name>.westlaw.docx`; never patch sentence by sentence.**
- Never trust a corruption tell you have not grepped for in **both** files.

`lensesThatFlagged` is `["lens"]` whenever a blocking finding of the criteria/scope lens still stands,
and `[]` otherwise. **The legibility and fidelity
scores appear in no selector at all**: `scoredChecks` opens no channel, which is the same fact as
their not gating. A low score is
read by the human at Phase 5 and acted on there or not at all; it never re-runs anything by itself.
A `null` score with a stated reason means the item was unreliable or its agent died — not clean.

## The rule for whoever edits this next

**Any property this file asserts about `work` must be traceable to a parameter `work` reads or to a
command's exit code. Otherwise it is decoration.** Three times in this skill's construction a property
was written as a sentence and bound nothing, and a fourth is recorded below: a re-run selector declared to be a "caption", a dimension
`work` has no channel for; two review dimensions declared ADVISORY while sitting in the gating
review lens, which `work` computes `overallPass` from; and an interview refusal declared absolute when no mechanism could carry it — the plan is
written by the orchestrator, so a grep of it cannot identify the answerer, and `mechanicalChecks` run
after IMPLEMENT, so none of them can stop a run at CLARIFY. The first two now rest on a parameter —
the task-id selector and `scoredChecks`. The third was **scoped down** instead: `check.sh --plan`
proves only that the answers are recorded and non-empty, and the instructor's approval of the plan is
named as the step that carries the rest.

The fourth was the scored checks being "reported to the human". `work`'s Phase 5 is a human step, so no
exit code can compel a human to read a score, and three review rounds said so before the claim came
out. It too was scoped down rather than re-promised: the scores are **retrievable** at a named `jq`
command over `result.json`, a reviewer who does not run it does not see them, and that is the accepted
cost of their not gating.

**So: when no parameter and no exit code can carry a property, SCOPE THE CLAIM DOWN to what the
mechanism does prove, and name the human step that carries the remainder.** An honest smaller claim
beats a bigger one nothing enforces. Before writing "this workflow does X", name the parameter or the
command that makes X true — and if there is none, say so plainly where the claim would have gone.

## Red flags — STOP if you catch yourself

| About to | Do instead |
|---|---|
| Answer either CLARIFY question yourself | Stop and ask, or report that the interview is unanswered. Nothing mechanical can catch a self-answer — the plan is written by the orchestrator, so only the instructor's approval distinguishes his answers from yours |
| Ask about a passage to keep, or about the insertion point | Both were declined; insertion point and class number come from the request or the schedule. The page target IS asked — question 3 |
| Type a `--target` on a real run, or invent a range to fit the excerpt | The target lives in the plan, per reading. With `--plan` the flag is ignored and said to be ignored; `--target` is the `--no-plan` fixture override |
| Leave a `## Readings In Scope` page target blank or `TBD` | The `--plan` leg FAILS naming the row. Ask question 3, or take the 2-6 default |
| Let a legibility or fidelity finding block the run | They are `scoredChecks`, which `work`'s `overallPass` never reads — the deterministic gate is the entry point's exit code |
| Add legibility or fidelity to the `lens` prompt because it "reads like a lens" | The lens gates by construction; the advisory property has to be a parameter, not a sentence. Keep them in `scoredChecks` |
| Omit `lens` or pass `{}` to turn review off | both select `work`'s generic default. Keep the explicit criteria/scope checklist, with legibility and fidelity only in `scoredChecks` |
| Add a threshold or `blockBelow` to a scored check | No such knob exists, and adding one chases minors. Read the score; gate on the entry point |
| Add a second `mechanicalChecks` entry | The verdict is one command; P10 refuses a list, and a list drops a check without reporting it |
| Write a `workflow.js` for this skill | `work`'s spine takes a parameter for it. Name the missing parameter and generalize `work` |
| Give every reading row `docs` in its writable paths | `work` refuses a wave with overlapping writable paths before dispatch. `retrieve` owns `docs/` in wave 1; the cut rows write one fragment each |
| Write "this workflow does X" with nothing reading X | Name the parameter or the exit code that makes it true, or record that none does — see *The rule for whoever edits this next* |
| Write that the scores "are reported to the human" | Nothing reports them. They sit in `result.json` under `scores[]`; Phase 5 names the `jq` command that prints them, and a reviewer who does not run it does not see them |
| Re-cut every reading after one FAIL | Re-run `onlyTasks` on the flagged reading's task id — one task per reading is what makes that possible |
| Scope a re-run "by caption" | `work` has no caption channel; consume `tasksThatFlagged`, `mechanicalThatFailed`, `lensesThatFlagged` and `planFindings` |
| Silently skip a reading that has no reporter source | Stop and report it. The instructor declares it in the plan's `## Non-court readings` section; an undeclared one FAILS, which is the point |
| Write `// elide-unchecked:` into the `.typ` to quiet a reading | That marker is self-exempting and is no longer honoured — its presence FAILS. Non-court text is declared in the plan, by the instructor |
| Omit both `--plan` and `--no-plan` from the entry point's `cmd` | That is a FAIL naming the missing flag — the leg fails closed. Pass `--plan <md>` on a real run; `--no-plan` is the fixture escape and prints a loud NOT CHECKED line |
| Say the workflow "cannot arm" or "does not proceed" without the interview | No mechanism carries that. Say what does: the answers are recorded in the plan, the instructor approves the plan before the run arms, and `check.sh --plan` refuses a plan whose section is missing or unfilled |
| Write an editors' note on every reading | The default is NO note (instructor, 2026-09-10). One exists only for BACKGROUND — prior history, an earlier related decision, real-world context — or a disclosure specific to that one reading |
| Repeat the elision-mark and footnote conventions in each reading's note | They are stated ONCE in the preamble and cover the whole document. That repetition is the boilerplate the reversal removed |
| Reword the court's text to close a widow | The fix vocabulary is LAYOUT-ONLY — spacing, or where the page breaks. Rewording defeats the verbatim gate; if the two conflict, fidelity wins and the widow stands |
| Pass `--no-widows` on a real run | It waives the page-break leg and prints a loud NOT CHECKED line. The leg is on by default; leave it on |
| Write a `.westlaw.txt` beside the docx, or cut from one | The docx is the only stored source and its projection is in memory. The twin that existed dropped the docx's italic runs, and the cut read only the twin — that is how a 27-page excerpt shipped with every case name in roman |
| Add emphasis the source does not carry, or set a source italic in roman | The excerpt inherits the court's typography. Invented emphasis and dropped emphasis are both misquotation, and neither is caught by matching words alone |
| Re-create a `.westlaw.txt` for a case whose docx is in `docs/` | The six that existed were deleted on 2026-09-10 and both gates re-ran green against the docx, so nothing needs one. A `.txt` naming survives only where the fallback route produced it, and `// elide-source: X.westlaw.txt` resolves to the `.docx` rather than failing |
| Read a CourtListener/RECAP `.txt` and assume its typography | That route is a court PDF with **no formatting layer** — italics are unrecoverable there, not merely unchecked. The gate prints ITALICS NOT CHECKED for it; the route stays, because Westlaw does not carry every case |
| Hand-edit a table range so the checker passes | Fix the source and recompile |
