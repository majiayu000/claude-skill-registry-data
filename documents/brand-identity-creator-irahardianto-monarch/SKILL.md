# Brand Identity Creator

## Overview

This skill assists in the creation of professional Brand Identity Guidelines. It guides the user through the discovery of the brand's core, personality, and visual identity, and generates a structured document.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Brand Discovery
Understand the foundation of the brand.
*   **Mission**: Why does the brand exist?
*   **Vision**: Where is the brand going?
*   **Values**: What principles guide the brand?
*   **Target Audience**: Who is the brand for?

### Phase 2: Brand Personality
Define how the brand communicates.
*   **Archetype**: See [brand-archetypes.md](references/brand-archetypes.md) for the 12 common personas.
*   **Voice & Tone**: Is the brand formal or casual? Serious or humorous?

### Phase 3: Visual Identity
Define the visual elements.
*   **Colors**: Primary and secondary palettes (Hex/RGB).
*   **Typography**: Header and body fonts.
*   **Logo**: Usage rules (if applicable).
*   **Imagery**: Photo and icon styles.

### Phase 4: Document Generation
Once the information is gathered, populate the [brand-guidelines-template.md](assets/brand-guidelines-template.md) with the defined content.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Assess current state**: Determine how much of the brand identity is already defined.
2.  **Interview/Propose**:
    *   If undefined, ask targeted questions to extract the mission/vision/values.
    *   Propose archetypes or colors based on the industry and audience.
3.  **Draft**: Use the template structure to draft the content.
4.  **Refine**: Iterate with the user on specific sections (e.g., "Is this tone too casual?").
5.  **Finalize**: Present the complete Brand Identity Guidelines markdown document.
