## Process Flow

### Step 1: Collect Information
Ask the user:
1. "What time period are you documenting? (e.g., 'January 2025', 'Q1 2025', 'December 2024')"
2. "Please share your rough notes of work activities, accomplishments, and contributions during this period. Don't worry about formatting - just brain dump everything you did!"

### Step 2: Parse and Map
For EACH item the user mentions:
1. Identify which competency category(ies) it demonstrates
2. Note the specific activity/contribution
3. Identify any quantifiable metrics or impacts mentioned
4. **CRITICAL**: Ensure EVERY detail is captured - create a tracking list as you go

### Step 3: Proactively Extract More Details Through Targeted Questions
**THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP - DO NOT SKIP**

After initial parsing, analyze the competency coverage and ASK THE USER targeted questions to extract more details:

1. **Review competency coverage**: Identify which competencies have few or no examples
2. **Analyze user's work**: Look at what they mentioned and identify opportunities to extract more details that could fit underrepresented competencies
3. **Ask targeted probing questions** based on what's missing. Examples:

**For Courageous Leadership (CL):**
- "You mentioned [X work] - did you have to influence others or lead by example on this?"
- "Did you initiate or champion any new projects, methods, or ideas during this period?"
- "Were there any situations where you had to connect your work to larger team or department goals?"

**For Teamwork (TW):**
- "When you worked on [Y] - how did you collaborate with others? Did you share resources or information?"
- "Were there any conflict resolution or 'win-win' situations you navigated?"
- "Did you help others succeed or capitalize on team members' strengths in any way?"

**For Analysis & Decision Making (A&D):**
- "You solved [problem] - did you analyze it from multiple angles or conduct root-cause analysis?"
- "Were there any situations where you had to facilitate consensus or partner with others in decision-making?"
- "Did you apply business knowledge or develop innovative solutions to any challenges?"

**For Communication (COMM):**
- "Did you create any documentation, presentations, or written communication during this period?"
- "Were there any situations where you had to communicate across different levels of the organization?"
- "Did you facilitate any discussions, meetings, or group sessions?"

**For Customer Service (CS):**
- "You helped [person/team] - was this an internal or external customer? How did you prioritize their needs?"
- "Did you go above and beyond for any customers or resolve any urgent customer issues?"
- "Were there situations where you had to deliver on customer commitments or find win-win solutions?"

**For Planning & Execution (PE):**
- "What deadlines or commitments were you working toward with [X work]?"
- "Did you have to manage multiple projects or adjust plans based on changing circumstances?"
- "Were there any situations where you set high quality standards or displayed fiscal responsibility?"

**For Mentoring (M):**
- "You helped [person] with [thing] - can you tell me more about how you mentored or guided them?"
- "Did you provide any feedback (positive or developmental) to team members?"
- "Were there any 'teachable moments' where you helped someone grow or learn something new?"

**For Technical Skills/Subject Matter Expert (TS):**
- "What specific technical skills or tools did you use for [work]?"
- "Did you identify any process or system improvements during this period?"
- "Were you the go-to expert for any particular technology or domain area?"

**Cross-cutting questions to extract hidden details:**
- "You mentioned you worked on [item] - what was the impact? Were there any metrics?"
- "Did you share your knowledge about [topic] with others, either formally or informally?"
- "Were there any challenges you had to overcome, and how did you approach them?"
- "Did any of your work involve innovation, learning something new, or applying creativity?"

**Instructions for this step:**
- Present these questions in a conversational, helpful way
- Group related questions together by competency
- Explain WHY you're asking (e.g., "I want to make sure we capture your mentoring contributions since I see you helped several people")
- Allow the user to answer what's relevant and skip what's not applicable
- Use their answers to enrich the documentation across all competencies

### Step 4: Transform to Professional Language
For each activity:
- Use strong action verbs: Led, Drove, Implemented, Delivered, Collaborated, Designed, Optimized, Resolved, Mentored, Facilitated, Established, Improved, etc.
- Quantify impact where possible (percentages, time saved, costs, number of people affected)
- Frame in terms of business value and outcomes
- Use past tense consistently
- Make it concise but impactful

### Step 5: Generate Output
Create a markdown file with this structure:

```
# Performance Highlights - [Period]
**Employee ID**: 261906

## Courageous Leadership (CL)
- [Professional statement 1]
- [Professional statement 2]

---

## Summary
[2-3 sentence paragraph highlighting key themes and overall impact across competencies]

---
*Document generated: [Current Date]*
*Ready for performance review and promotion discussions*
```

### Step 6: Save and Verify
1. Save file to: `C:\Users\261906\.claude\competency-tracking\competency-[period-name].md`
   - Example: `competency-january-2025.md` or `competency-q1-2025.md`
2. Show the user the file path
3. Create a verification checklist showing:
   - Total items from input: [X]
   - Total items mapped in output: [Y]
   - Any unmapped items (if any - list them)

### Step 7: Iterate if Needed
Ask: "Would you like to add more details, adjust any categorizations, or refine any statements?"

## Important Guidelines

### Language Transformation Examples
**Input**: "Fixed that bug in payment system"
**Output**: "Diagnosed and resolved critical defect in payment processing system, ensuring system reliability and preventing potential revenue impact"

**Input**: "Helped John with deployment"
**Output**: "Mentored team member on deployment process, building team capability and ensuring knowledge continuity"

**Input**: "Led meeting when Sarah was out"
**Output**: "Assumed leadership responsibilities for team coordination meeting during manager absence, ensuring team alignment and project momentum"

**Input**: "Suggested new caching approach, improved performance 30%"
**Output**: "Proposed and implemented advanced caching strategy, resulting in 30% performance improvement and enhanced user experience"

### Handling Multiple Competencies
Some activities demonstrate multiple competencies. In these cases:
- Include the activity in BOTH/ALL relevant categories
- Frame the statement slightly differently to emphasize the specific competency aspect
- Example: "Mentored junior developer on API design" could go in:
  - **M (Mentoring)**: "Provided technical mentorship to junior developer on API design principles, accelerating their professional development"
  - **TS (Technical)**: "Leveraged expertise in API architecture to guide team member through complex design decisions, elevating team's technical capabilities"

### Ensuring Completeness
- As you parse the user's input, maintain a checklist
- Before finalizing, cross-reference every input item against your output
- If something doesn't fit any category, flag it for the user to discuss

### Professional Tone
- Avoid vague language ("worked on", "helped with", "did some")
- Emphasize impact and outcomes, not just activities
- Use business-oriented language
- Be specific about what was achieved

## Ready to Begin
When the user invokes this skill, start with Step 1 and guide them through the process.
