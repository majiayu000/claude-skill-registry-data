<objective>
Covers Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) 2026 for the six target AI engines (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT with web search, Perplexity, Claude with web search, Gemini, Bing Copilot). Documents the `scripts/geo-score.ts` LLM-readiness scoring (0-100 across 10 weighted signals), quantified impact data (statistics/authoritative citations/expert quotes boost AI visibility up to +40%; keyword stuffing costs -10%), the recommended content structure for LLM extraction, and llms.txt placement (ignored by Google's crawlers, useful for other LLMs). Distinct from seo-featured-snippets (position-0 HTML recipes) and seo-entity (the schema/salience signals that feed AI citations).
