# Better Route Resource write schema

Use `writeSchema()` to validate and normalize Resource create/update payload fields. `payloadSchema()` is an exact alias.

```php
Resource::make('articles')
    ->allow(['create', 'update'])
    ->fields(['id', 'title', 'status', 'priority', 'published_at'])
    ->writeSchema([
        'title' => [
            'type' => 'string',
            'required' => true,
            'sanitize' => 'text',
            'minLength' => 1,
            'maxLength' => 180,
        ],
        'status' => [
            'type' => 'enum',
            'values' => ['draft', 'published'],
        ],
        'priority' => ['type' => 'int', 'min' => 0, 'max' => 100],
        'published_at' => ['type' => 'date', 'nullable' => true],
    ]);
```

The enum allowlist is flat: use `['type' => 'enum', 'values' => [...]]`. Do not nest `values` under an `enum` key.

## Rule contract

- Type strings may be supplied directly, such as `'title' => 'string'`.
- Supported coercion types are `int`/`integer`, `float`/`number`, `bool`/`boolean`, `string`, `date`, `email`, `url`, `enum`, `array`, `object`, and `mixed`.
- `required` is enforced only on `create`; updates may be partial but must contain at least one writable field.
- `nullable: true` accepts `null`; otherwise `null` fails validation.
- String constraints are `minLength`, `maxLength`, and `regex`. Numeric constraints are `min` and `max`.
- `email` and `url` use PHP validation after coercion/sanitization. `date` is only string coercion; validate date format with `regex` or a callable sanitizer/other domain layer.
- Sanitizers are `text`, `email`, `key`, `url`, or a callable receiving `(value, field)`. An unknown sanitizer string leaves the value unchanged, so never treat arbitrary names as validation.
- Callable sanitizers transform values; they are not authorization checks and must return a value compatible with subsequent constraints.

Resource writable fields come from configured `fields` minus the ID field. Unknown payload keys fail with `400 validation_failed`; they are not silently dropped. A field denied by `fieldPolicy` also fails, rather than disappearing from the write.

Validation errors use the standard error envelope with `details.fieldErrors`. Boolean `fieldPolicy: false` produces a 400 non-writable validation error; failed capabilities or policy callbacks produce 403 errors. Follow `br-resource-policy` for authorization.

## Checks

- Test unknown, empty, null, malformed, boundary, and coerced values.
- Test required fields separately on create and partial update.
- Test enum values with strict type expectations; enum values are compared strictly after string coercion.
- Anchor regexes and set explicit maximum lengths before expensive domain processing.
- Do not add `patch` to `allow()`; the Resource action name is `update`, even though its route handles update semantics.
