  Institutional-grade equity research skills for AI agents. 80 Claude-type skills
  across 14 verticals (equity-research-core, models-and-pitches, bio-pharm,
  scenarios, quantitative-analysis, idea-generation, options-derivatives,
  business-intelligence, industry-analysis, macro-strategy, portfolio-strategy,
  technical-analysis, risk-and-psychology, trading-as-business) powered by
  agentii.ai's agent-use-ready SEC filing data plane — SEC filings and 15K+ earnings
  call transcripts, 15.99M XBRL facts, and company profiles for 1,146+
  US-public-equity tickers. Features the three-layer retrieval protocol (Document
  Discovery → Page Map → Deep Read, with deep-outline escalation) — measured, not
  asserted: 97.5% saved against a sequential read, and the page map itself is 10.0%
  of one (spec 062 T030, 2026-09-23) — server-side parallel multi-period search via search_cross_period, a
  full Excel/PPT generation pipeline with 3-tier office backend support, and the
  spec-046 governance layer (constitution, thesis and single-skill modes,
  mechanical gates, and a template-owned disclaimer on generated reports).
