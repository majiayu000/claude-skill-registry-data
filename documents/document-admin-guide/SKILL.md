# Admin Guide Documentation Skill

## Purpose

Create documentation for **non-technical users** (Humberto, parts counter staff) who need to use the admin interface without coding knowledge.

## Audience Characteristics

- **No coding experience** - avoid all technical jargon
- **Task-focused** - they want to accomplish something specific
- **Visual learners** - benefit from screenshots and step-by-step guidance
- **Time-constrained** - need quick answers, not deep explanations

## Instructions

When documenting admin features:

1. **Identify the task** the user wants to accomplish
2. **Use plain language** - no technical terms without explanation
3. **Follow the admin-how-to template** in `templates/admin-how-to.md`
4. **Include "What you'll see" sections** for visual guidance
5. **Output to** `/docs/admin-guide/[task-name].md`

## Smart Interaction

### ASK the User When:

- Creating a new admin guide (confirm topic and scope)
- Deleting an admin guide (confirm deletion)
- Major restructure of admin section

### PROCEED Autonomously When:

- Updating existing admin guides
- Adding clarifications or examples
- Fixing typos or improving wording
- Adding troubleshooting tips

## Writing Guidelines

### DO:

- Use numbered steps (1, 2, 3...)
- Start steps with action verbs ("Click", "Select", "Enter")
- Include "What you'll see" descriptions
- Add "If something goes wrong" sections
- Keep sentences short (under 20 words)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Define any term that might be unfamiliar

### DON'T:

- Use code blocks (unless showing what to type in a form)
- Reference file paths or technical architecture
- Assume knowledge of developer tools
- Use acronyms without explanation
- Include implementation details

## Language Examples

| Instead of...              | Write...                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| "Navigate to the endpoint" | "Go to the page"        |
| "Submit the form"          | "Click the Save button" |
| "The API returns..."       | "You'll see..."         |
| "Configure the settings"   | "Change the options"    |
| "Execute the action"       | "Click the button"      |
| "Authenticate"             | "Log in"                |
| "Query the database"       | "Search for"            |

## Template Location

Use the template at: `.claude/skills/document-admin-guide/templates/admin-how-to.md`
