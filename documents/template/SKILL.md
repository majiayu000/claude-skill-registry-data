# Shopify Yourskill

One or two sentences: what this skill covers and the core principle. Cross-
reference sibling skills by name when a task belongs to one of them, rather than
repeating their content.

## Guidelines for a good ecom skill

Delete this section in your real skill; it's guidance for authoring.

- **Name:** `shopify-<area>` (or `ecom-<area>` for platform-neutral skills),
  lowercase and hyphens only. The directory name MUST equal the frontmatter
  `name`.
- **Description:** starts with "Use when…", lists concrete triggers and
  keywords, ends with a "not for X, use Y" pointer. No workflow summary: an
  agent follows the description to decide whether to load the body.
- **Original prose only.** Do not paste from shopify.dev, the Matrixify docs, or
  any other source; write the lesson in your own words and link the canonical
  doc. Ship the institutional knowledge agency work teaches that the docs don't.
- **Body 100–200 lines; heavy detail in `references/*.md`.** No `scripts/`
  directory: this collection is markdown-only (see recipes doctrine below).
- Every SKILL.md ends with a **Provenance and maintenance** section.

## Store access

Every skill that touches the Admin API opens with this stanza (paste it, adjust
the scopes line to this skill's minimum). Two lanes; pick one.

**Lane A: custom-app token (scriptable).** In Shopify admin: Settings → Apps
and sales channels → Develop apps → create an app → grant the minimum scopes
this skill needs, then install and copy the Admin API access token. Export it;
never write it to a committed file:

```bash
export SHOPIFY_STORE="your-store.myshopify.com"
export SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN="<your Admin API access token>"   # keep it in the env, not on disk
```

Call the GraphQL endpoint (this skill's minimum scopes: `read_products`,
`write_products`; edit per skill):

```bash
curl -s "https://$SHOPIFY_STORE/admin/api/2025-07/graphql.json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: $SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ shop { name } }"}'
```

**Lane B: Shopify CLI OAuth (no stored token).** `shopify store auth --store
$SHOPIFY_STORE --scopes read_products,write_products` then `shopify store
execute` to run a validated operation. Good for token-less stores where the
owner logs in interactively.

**Toolkit preflight.** Lane B rides on the Shopify CLI: run `shopify version`
first and install it if missing. For the full Admin GraphQL schema and
per-object reference, pair your skill with Shopify's official AI toolkit
plugin. In Claude Code, check `claude plugin list`; if it isn't there:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Shopify/Shopify-AI-Toolkit
claude plugin install shopify-plugin@shopify-ai-toolkit
```

Recommended, not required: Lane A needs only curl and a token. The toolkit
gives your agent the API; your skill gives it the playbook.

## Recipes, not scripts

This collection ships **recipes, not programs.** The GraphQL/curl blocks here
are copy-and-adapt starting points: your agent writes throwaway code per
engagement against the current schema, runs it, and discards it. That keeps the
skill honest across Shopify's schema changes and avoids shipping a binary that
silently rots. Two rules make recipes safe:

1. **Preview before you mutate.** Every mutation recipe is preceded by a
   read-only count/preview query. Run the count, sanity-check the number against
   what you expect, and only then mutate. A count far above expectation means
   stop and re-scope, not proceed.
2. **Safe-mode defaults, stated in prose.** Fill missing only, never overwrite;
   MERGE not REPLACE; hide/archive before delete. State the destructive path
   exists and how to opt into it deliberately, never make it the default.

## Non-destructive doctrine

- Read before you write. A read-only query is always cheap; an unscoped mutation
  is not reversible.
- Back up first where a bulk export is the backup (Matrixify export, or a
  `bulkOperationRunQuery` dump) before a large write.
- **Verify against ground truth via the Admin API, not the storefront.** The
  storefront is CDN-cached and lies about freshness; read the object back
  through `admin/api/.../graphql.json` to confirm a write landed.
- Never print or commit an Admin API access token. Read it from the env.

## [Your sections]

Quick-reference tables, the specific traps agency work taught, worked examples
with real numbers but anonymized brands. One excellent example beats five
generic ones.

## References

- [references/topic.md](references/topic.md): heavy detail loaded on demand.

## Provenance and maintenance

Last verified: 2026-07-05. GraphQL pinned to Admin API 2025-07; Shopify
deprecates versions on a rolling quarterly schedule, so verify against
[shopify.dev](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql) before trusting a
version-specific claim. Read-only re-verification a stranger can run:

```bash
# confirm your token reaches the store and the API version resolves
curl -s "https://$SHOPIFY_STORE/admin/api/2025-07/graphql.json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: $SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ shop { name currencyCode } }"}'
```

These skills capture operational lessons the docs don't; they are not a
replacement for the reference.
