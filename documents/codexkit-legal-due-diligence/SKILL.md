# Legal Due Diligence Analyst

## When to Use

- Before signing an M&A deal, JV agreement, or investment
- When evaluating a target company's legal risk profile
- When preparing a due diligence report for the board or investment committee
- When a lender or investor requires legal DD as a condition

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Scope and Materiality

1. Confirm deal type: M&A (asset/share), JV, Investment, Licensing
2. Define materiality thresholds (e.g., contracts > $50K, litigation > $100K)
3. Set access parameters: full data room, limited access, or desktop review

### Step 2 — 9 Workstream Review

| # | Workstream | Key Questions |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Corporate** | Incorporation docs, cap table, board minutes, subsidiaries, shareholder agreements |
| 2 | **Contracts** | Material contracts, change of control clauses, termination provisions, exclusivity |
| 3 | **IP** | Patents, trademarks, copyrights, licenses, open-source exposure, trade secrets |
| 4 | **Litigation** | Pending/threatened claims, regulatory proceedings, arbitrations, settlements |
| 5 | **Regulatory** | Licenses, permits, sector-specific compliance, sanctions, export controls |
| 6 | **Employment** | Key person risk, employment contracts, non-competes, benefit obligations, labor disputes |
| 7 | **Tax** | Tax returns, assessments, transfer pricing, tax losses, withholding obligations |
| 8 | **Environmental** | Environmental liabilities, contamination, permits, ESG compliance |
| 9 | **Data Privacy** | GDPR/CCPA compliance, data processing agreements, breach history, cross-border transfers |

### Step 3 — Risk Assessment

For each finding, classify:

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 🔴 Critical / Deal-breaker | Could kill the deal or require fundamental restructuring | Escalate immediately |
| 🟠 High | Requires contractual protection (indemnity, escrow, warranty) | Negotiate in SPA |
| 🟡 Medium | Manageable post-closing with defined plan | Monitor and plan |
| 🟢 Low | Standard, no special action | Note for record |

### Step 4 — Closing Conditions

Generate conditions precedent (CPs) for any 🔴 or 🟠 finding that must be resolved before closing.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Format |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Deal type | Yes | M&A / JV / Investment / Licensing |
| Target company docs | Yes | Data room or document list |
| Materiality threshold | Recommended | Currency amount |
| Prior DD reports | Optional | If available from advisors |

```

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Every finding is tied to a specific evidence source (log, test, metric)
- [ ] Pass/fail criteria are binary and measurable — no subjective judgments
- [ ] Severity levels are assigned with clear thresholds
- [ ] Remediation steps are provided for all critical and high findings

## Verification (4C)

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Are all pass/fail criteria applied against the correct standard or rule? |
| **Completeness** | Were all required dimensions or checklist items evaluated? |
| **Context-fit** | Does the verification scope match the actual risk level of the deliverable? |
| **Consequence** | If this passed verification but had a hidden flaw, what is the worst-case impact? |

## Edge Cases

- **Incomplete data for full assessment** — Document which checks were limited and flag for re-verification when data becomes available.
- **Ambiguous pass/fail criteria** — Request clarification from the standard owner before scoring. Mark as 'Needs Review'.
- **Multiple overlapping standards** — Identify the governing standard and note where others diverge.
