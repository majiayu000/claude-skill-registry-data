# fix-reporter Skill

**Purpose:** Automatically document solved problems to build searchable institutional knowledge with category-based organization (enum-validated problem types).

## Overview

This skill captures problem solutions immediately after confirmation, creating structured documentation that serves as a searchable knowledge base for future sessions.

**Organization:** Single-file architecture - each problem documented as one markdown file in its symptom category directory within `lessons_path` (default: `.claude/lessons/`, e.g., `{lessons_path}/performance-issues/n-plus-one-queries.md`). Files use YAML frontmatter for metadata and searchability. Lessons with `workflow_phase` fields are automatically discoverable by the lessons-discoverer agent.

## 7-Step Process

<step number="1" required="true">
### Step 1: Detect Confirmation

**Auto-invoke after phrases:**

- "that worked"
- "it's fixed"
- "working now"
- "problem solved"
- "that did it"

**OR manual:** `/report-fix` command

**Non-trivial problems only:**

- Multiple investigation attempts needed
- Tricky debugging that took time
- Non-obvious solution
- Future sessions would benefit

**Skip documentation for:**

- Simple typos
- Obvious syntax errors
- Trivial fixes immediately corrected
</step>

<step number="2" required="true" depends_on="1">
### Step 2: Gather Context

Extract from conversation history:

**Required information:**

- **Module name**: Which project module had the problem
- **Symptom**: Observable error/behavior (exact error messages)
- **Investigation attempts**: What didn't work and why
- **Root cause**: Technical explanation of actual problem
- **Solution**: What fixed it (code/config changes)
- **Prevention**: How to avoid in future

**Environment details:**

- Framework/language version
- OS version
- File/line references

**BLOCKING REQUIREMENT:** If critical context is missing (module name, exact error, or resolution steps), ask user and WAIT for response before proceeding to Step 3:

```
I need a few details to document this properly:

1. Which module had this issue? [ModuleName]
2. What was the exact error message or symptom?

[Continue after user provides details]
```
</step>

<step number="3" required="false" depends_on="2">
### Step 3: Check Existing Docs

Read lessons_path from config and search for similar issues:

```bash
# Get lessons path from config (default: .claude/lessons/)
LESSONS_PATH=$(claude -p "/majestic:config lessons_path .claude/lessons/")

# Search by error message keywords
grep -r "exact error phrase" "$LESSONS_PATH/"

# Search by symptom category
ls "$LESSONS_PATH/[category]/"
```

**IF similar issue found:**

THEN present decision options:

```
Found similar issue: docs/solutions/[path]

What's next?
1. Create new doc with cross-reference (recommended)
2. Update existing doc (only if same root cause)
3. Other

Choose (1-3): _
```

WAIT for user response, then execute chosen action.

**ELSE** (no similar issue found):

Proceed directly to Step 4 (no user interaction needed).
</step>

<step number="4" required="true" depends_on="2">
### Step 4: Generate Filename

Format: `[sanitized-symptom]-[module]-[YYYYMMDD].md`

**Sanitization rules:**

- Lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters except hyphens
- Truncate to reasonable length (< 80 chars)

**Examples:**

- `missing-import-auth-module-20251110.md`
- `parameter-not-saving-state-api-20251110.md`
- `webview-crash-on-resize-frontend-20251110.md`
</step>

<step number="5" required="true" depends_on="4" blocking="true">
### Step 5: Validate YAML Schema

**Important:** All docs require validated YAML frontmatter with enum validation.

<validation_gate name="yaml-schema" blocking="true">

**Validate against schema:**
Load `schema.yaml` and classify the problem against the enum values defined in `references/yaml-schema.md`. Ensure all required fields are present and match allowed values exactly.

**BLOCK if validation fails:**

```
YAML validation failed

Errors:
- problem_type: must be one of schema enums, got "compilation_error"
- severity: must be one of [critical, high, medium, low], got "severe"
- symptoms: must be array with 1-5 items, got string

Please provide corrected values.
```

**GATE ENFORCEMENT:** Do NOT proceed to Step 6 (Create Documentation) until YAML frontmatter passes all validation rules defined in `schema.yaml`.

</validation_gate>
</step>

<step number="6" required="true" depends_on="5">
### Step 6: Create Documentation

**Read lessons_path from config:**
```bash
LESSONS_PATH=$(claude -p "/majestic:config lessons_path .claude/lessons/")
```

**Determine category from problem_type:** Use the category mapping defined in `references/yaml-schema.md`.

**Create documentation file:**

```bash
PROBLEM_TYPE="[from validated YAML]"
CATEGORY="[mapped from problem_type]"
FILENAME="[generated-filename].md"
DOC_PATH="${LESSONS_PATH}/${CATEGORY}/${FILENAME}"

# Create directory if needed
mkdir -p "${LESSONS_PATH}/${CATEGORY}"

# Write documentation using template from assets/resolution-template.md
# (Content populated with Step 2 context and validated YAML frontmatter)
```

**Result:**
- Single file in category directory under lessons_path
- Enum validation ensures consistent categorization
- Optional discovery fields enable lessons-discoverer integration

**Create documentation:** Populate the structure from `assets/resolution-template.md` with context gathered in Step 2 and validated YAML frontmatter from Step 5.

**Discovery opt-in:** If this lesson should surface automatically during workflows, add the optional discovery fields (lesson_type, workflow_phase, tech_stack, impact, keywords) to the frontmatter.
</step>

<step number="7" required="false" depends_on="6">
### Step 7: Cross-Reference & Critical Pattern Detection

If similar issues found in Step 3:

**Update existing doc:**

```bash
# Add Related Issues link to similar doc
echo "- See also: [$FILENAME]($REAL_FILE)" >> [similar-doc.md]
```

**Update new doc:**
Already includes cross-reference from Step 6.

**Update patterns if applicable:**

If this represents a common pattern (3+ similar issues):

```bash
# Add to docs/solutions/patterns/common-solutions.md
cat >> docs/solutions/patterns/common-solutions.md << 'EOF'

## [Pattern Name]

**Common symptom:** [Description]
**Root cause:** [Technical explanation]
**Solution pattern:** [General approach]

**Examples:**
- [Link to doc 1]
- [Link to doc 2]
- [Link to doc 3]
EOF
```

**Critical Pattern Detection (Optional Proactive Suggestion):**

If this issue has automatic indicators suggesting it might be critical:
- Severity: `critical` in YAML
- Affects multiple modules OR foundational component
- Non-obvious solution

Then in the decision menu (Step 8), add a note:
```
This might be worth adding to Critical Patterns (Option 2)
```

But **don't auto-promote**. User decides via decision menu (Option 2).

**Template for critical pattern addition:**

When user selects Option 2 (Add to Critical Patterns), use the template from `assets/critical-pattern-template.md` to structure the pattern entry.
</step>

</critical_sequence>

<decision_gate name="post-documentation" wait_for_user="true">

## Decision Menu After Capture

After successful documentation, present options and WAIT for user response:

```
Solution documented

File created:
- {lessons_path}/[category]/[filename].md

What's next?
1. Continue workflow (recommended)
2. Add to Critical Patterns - Promote to critical-patterns.md
3. Link related issues - Connect to similar problems
4. Add to existing skill - Add to a learning skill
5. Create new skill - Extract into new learning skill
6. View documentation - See what was captured
7. Enable discovery - Add workflow_phase fields for auto-discovery
8. Other
```

**Handle responses:**

**Option 1: Continue workflow**

- Return to calling skill/workflow
- Documentation is complete

**Option 2: Add to Critical Patterns**

User selects this when:
- System made this mistake multiple times across different modules
- Solution is non-obvious but must be followed every time
- Foundational requirement

Action:
1. Extract pattern from the documentation
2. Format as WRONG vs CORRECT with code examples
3. Add to `docs/solutions/patterns/critical-patterns.md`
4. Add cross-reference back to this doc
5. Confirm: "Added to Critical Patterns. All subagents will see this pattern before code generation."

**Option 3: Link related issues**

- Prompt: "Which doc to link? (provide filename or describe)"
- Search docs/solutions/ for the doc
- Add cross-reference to both docs
- Confirm: "Cross-reference added"

**Option 4: Add to existing skill**

User selects this when the documented solution relates to an existing learning skill:

Action:
1. Prompt: "Which skill?"
2. Determine which reference file to update (resources.md, patterns.md, or examples.md)
3. Add link and brief description to appropriate section
4. Confirm: "Added to [skill-name] skill in [file]"

**Option 5: Create new skill**

User selects this when the solution represents the start of a new learning domain:

Action:
1. Prompt: "What should the new skill be called?"
2. Create skill directory structure
3. Create initial reference files with this solution as first example
4. Confirm: "Created new [skill-name] skill with this solution as first example"

**Option 6: View documentation**

- Display the created documentation
- Present decision menu again

**Option 7: Enable discovery**

User selects this to make the lesson discoverable by lessons-discoverer agent:

Action:
1. Prompt: "Which workflow phases? [planning, debugging, review, implementation]"
2. Prompt: "Which tech stacks? [rails, python, react, node, generic]"
3. Prompt: "What's the lesson type? [antipattern, gotcha, pattern, setup, workflow]"
4. Update the file's YAML frontmatter with:
   - `workflow_phase`: Selected phases
   - `tech_stack`: Selected stacks
   - `lesson_type`: Selected type
   - `impact`: Derived from severity (critical→blocks_work, high→major_time_sink, medium/low→minor_inconvenience)
   - `keywords`: Extract from tags + symptom keywords
5. Confirm: "Lesson now discoverable during [phases] workflows"

**Option 8: Other**

- Ask what they'd like to do

</decision_gate>

<integration_protocol>

## Integration Points

**Invoked by:**
- /report-fix command (primary interface)
- Manual invocation in conversation after solution confirmed
- Can be triggered by detecting confirmation phrases like "that worked", "it's fixed", etc.

**Invokes:**
- None (terminal skill - does not delegate to other skills)

**Handoff expectations:**
All context needed for documentation should be present in conversation history before invocation.

</integration_protocol>

<success_criteria>

## Success Criteria

Documentation is successful when ALL of the following are true:

- YAML frontmatter validated (all required fields, correct formats)
- File created in docs/solutions/[category]/[filename].md
- Enum values match schema.yaml exactly
- Code examples included in solution section
- Cross-references added if related issues found
- User presented with decision menu and action confirmed

</success_criteria>

## Error Handling

**Missing context:**

- Ask user for missing details
- Don't proceed until critical info provided

**YAML validation failure:**

- Show specific errors
- Present retry with corrected values
- BLOCK until valid

**Similar issue ambiguity:**

- Present multiple matches
- Let user choose: new doc, update existing, or link as duplicate

## Execution Guidelines

**MUST do:**
- Validate YAML frontmatter (BLOCK if invalid per Step 5 validation gate)
- Extract exact error messages from conversation
- Include code examples in solution section
- Create directories before writing files (`mkdir -p`)
- Ask user and WAIT if critical context missing

**MUST NOT do:**
- Skip YAML validation (validation gate is blocking)
- Use vague descriptions (not searchable)
- Omit code examples or cross-references

## Quality Guidelines

**Good documentation has:**

- Exact error messages (copy-paste from output)
- Specific file:line references
- Observable symptoms (what you saw, not interpretations)
- Failed attempts documented (helps avoid wrong paths)
- Technical explanation (not just "what" but "why")
- Code examples (before/after if applicable)
- Prevention guidance (how to catch early)
- Cross-references (related issues)

**Avoid:**

- Vague descriptions ("something was wrong")
- Missing technical details ("fixed the code")
- No context (which version? which file?)
- Just code dumps (explain why it works)
- No prevention guidance
- No cross-references

## Example Scenario

**User:** "That worked! The N+1 query is fixed."

**Skill activates:**

1. **Detect confirmation:** "That worked!" triggers auto-invoke
2. **Gather context:**
   - Module: User Service
   - Symptom: API response taking >5 seconds, N+1 query when loading user records
   - Failed attempts: Added pagination (didn't help), checked background job performance
   - Solution: Added eager loading with `includes(:profile)` on User model
   - Root cause: Missing eager loading causing separate database query per user
3. **Check existing:** No similar issue found
4. **Generate filename:** `n-plus-one-user-queries-UserService-20251110.md`
5. **Validate YAML:**
   ```yaml
   module: User Service
   date: 2025-11-10
   problem_type: performance_issue
   component: model
   symptoms:
     - "N+1 query when loading user records"
     - "API response taking >5 seconds"
   root_cause: missing_eager_load
   severity: high
   tags: [n-plus-one, eager-loading, performance]
   ```
   Valid
6. **Create documentation:**
   - `{lessons_path}/performance-issues/n-plus-one-user-queries-UserService-20251110.md`
7. **Cross-reference:** None needed (no similar issues)

**Output:**

```
Solution documented

File created:
- {lessons_path}/performance-issues/n-plus-one-user-queries-UserService-20251110.md

What's next?
1. Continue workflow (recommended)
2. Add to Critical Patterns - Promote to critical-patterns.md
3. Link related issues - Connect to similar problems
4. Add to existing skill - Add to a learning skill
5. Create new skill - Extract into new learning skill
6. View documentation - See what was captured
7. Enable discovery - Add workflow_phase fields for auto-discovery
