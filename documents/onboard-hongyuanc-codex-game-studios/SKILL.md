<!-- codex-studio-delegation: governed -->
Resolve every role through `../../../.codex/docs/plugin-agent-delegation.md`;
do not require a repository-local `.codex/agents/` or `.codex/agent-packs/` tree.
Before default delegation, run `python3 ../../../tools/codex_studio/agent_delegation.py resolve --project-root <project-root> --role <role>` and use only its returned role contract.

## Codex Interaction Contract

- Ask one decision question per turn and wait for the answer before asking another.
- Use `request_user_input` for structured choices when it is available; otherwise ask the same concise question directly.
- Use Codex custom agents by role and profile when delegation is useful.
- Treat any approved write as one complete proposed changeset. Before writing, present every target path and material edit together; do not add unlisted files or behavior.
- A new path, expanded scope, or material change requires a revised complete proposed changeset and fresh approval.

## Output Safety

Generate the onboarding draft in conversation. Before writing, show the complete proposed changeset and target path and ask once for approval.

## Phase 1: Load Project Context

Read AGENTS.md for project overview and standards.

Read the relevant agent definition from `.codex/agents/` if a specific role is specified.

---

## Phase 2: Scan Relevant Area

- For programmers: scan `src/` for architecture, patterns, key files
- For designers: scan `design/` for existing design documents
- For narrative: scan `design/narrative/` for world-building and story docs
- For QA: scan `tests/` for existing test coverage
- For production: scan `production/` for current sprint and milestone

Read recent changes (git log if available) to understand current momentum.

## Phase 3: Generate Onboarding Document

```markdown
# Onboarding: [Role/Area]

## Project Summary
[2-3 sentence summary of what this game is and its current state]

## Your Role
[What this role does on this project, key responsibilities, who you report to]

## Project Architecture
[Relevant architectural overview for this role]

### Key Directories
| Directory | Contents | Your Interaction |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|

### Key Files
| File | Purpose | Read Priority |
|------|---------|--------------|

## Current Standards and Conventions
[Summary of conventions relevant to this role from AGENTS.md and agent definition]

## Current State of Your Area
[What has been built, what is in progress, what is planned next]

## Current Sprint Context
[What the team is working on now and what is expected of this role]

## Key Dependencies
[What other roles/systems this role interacts with most]

## Common Pitfalls
[Things that trip up new contributors in this area]

## First Tasks
[Suggested first tasks to get oriented and productive]

1. [Read these documents first]
2. [Review this code/content]
3. [Start with this small task]

## Questions to Ask
[Questions the new contributor should ask to get fully oriented]
```

---

## Phase 4: Complete Proposed Changeset

Show the onboarding draft and canonical path `production/onboarding/onboard-[role]-[date].md`. Ask once whether to approve that complete proposed changeset before writing. Write only that approved file.
---

## Phase 5: Next Steps

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — onboarding document generated.

- Share the onboarding doc with the new contributor before their first session.
- Run `$sprint-status` to show the new contributor current progress.
- Run `$help` if the contributor needs guidance on what to work on next.
