name: Backend Models
description: Define database models with clear naming, proper data types, relationships, constraints, and validation rules. Use this skill when creating or editing ORM model files, database schema definitions, model classes, or entity definitions. When working with model files (e.g., `models/*.rb`, `models/*.py`, `*.model.ts`, `entities/*.java`), defining table structures, setting up foreign keys and relationships, adding timestamps, implementing data validation, or configuring database constraints. When establishing model associations, cascade behaviors, or indexes on model attributes.

- When setting up model relationships (has_many, belongs_to, many-to-many)
- When adding database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys)
- When implementing model-level validation rules
- When choosing appropriate data types for model attributes
- When adding created_at and updated_at timestamps
- When creating indexes on foreign keys or frequently queried fields
- When defining cascade behaviors for relationships
- When working in model directories or entity definition files

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend models.
