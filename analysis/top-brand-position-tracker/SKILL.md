  Ranks the brands within one Mercado Livre (Brasil) category by estimated weekly revenue and

  today's brand-ranking table and offers it for download; to see how positions moved, the user
  sends a brand table from a previous period and the skill shows each brand's movement (rose,
  fell, new, or out). The baseline is whatever table the user supplies — no hidden session
  memory. Use it to see the top brands in a category and which are rising or falling.
  Triggers: "top brands in this category", "which brands are growing", "brand ranking", and
  the pt-BR "principais marcas da categoria", "ranking de marcas", "quais marcas estão
  crescendo". Mercado Livre (Brasil) only; sales and revenue are JoomPulse estimates, not real
  transactions. To rank sellers (shops) rather than brands use the top-sellers-in-category
  skill; for category market size use the category-opportunity-index skill.

# Top brand position tracker

This skill ranks the **brands** inside one Mercado Livre (Brasil) category by
estimated weekly revenue and **tracks how each brand's position in that ranking
moves over time**. It aggregates each brand's active listings into a leaderboard.

Each run builds **today's brand-ranking table** for the category and offers it as
a **downloadable table**. To see how positions moved, the user **supplies a brand
table from a previous period** (the one this skill produced before); the skill
matches brands by name and shows each brand's position movement. **The baseline is
whatever table the user provides — there is no hidden session memory and nothing
is stored server-side.** A standalone run is the ranking only: no movement column
and no legend.

This is different from ranking sellers or sizing a category. To rank **sellers
(shops)** in a category, or to track how a seller leaderboard moves over time, use
the seller-ranking skills. To report a category's market size and opportunity
(estimated GMV, sales, number of sellers, average ticket), use the category
opportunity skill. This skill answers **"which brands lead this category, and how
did their positions move since a previous table?"**

## Prerequisites

- JoomPulse MCP access is configured for the current agent environment.
- The user provides the category to analyze — a category name, a category
  identifier, or a JoomPulse category link.
- For a period comparison, the user supplies a previous brand table that this skill
  produced for the same category (pasted or uploaded). Without it, the skill
  produces a standalone ranking.
- The available JoomPulse tools can look up the active listings in a category
  along with their estimated weekly sales and revenue, review counts, and prices.

If JoomPulse MCP access is unavailable, stop and explain that the skill requires
JoomPulse MCP setup before it can rank brands and track their positions.

## Scope

- **Mercado Livre (Brasil) only.** JoomPulse also covers Shopee Brasil, but
  **Shopee brand coverage is incomplete by construction** — only items with tracked
  sales carry a brand, so brands are systematically missing and a ranking would
  imply a completeness the data cannot support. Brand shares and brand leaderboards
  must not be computed for Shopee; this analysis exists only for Mercado Livre.
- **Sales and revenue are JoomPulse estimates** derived from historical listing
  data — not real transactions. Disclose this in every output. By contrast,
  **review count is real Mercado Livre history** — say so, it is a strength of the
  report.
- **Read-only.** The skill never signs in as the seller and never modifies
  anything; it does not store the ranking — the user keeps the downloadable table
  and brings it back next period.
- **The baseline is user-supplied.** Never claim a position change without a
  previous table to compare against, and never infer or fabricate one from memory.
- **Language:** write in the language of the message you are answering, and
  default to pt-BR only when that is unclear. Never infer the language from the
  store, its listings or the marketplace — those are Brazilian whatever
  language the seller writes in, so a seller who asks in English gets the whole
  report in English.
- **Keep the workflow invisible.** The seller wants the ranking, not a play-by-
  play. If one approach does not return data, switch to another quietly; only if
  every approach fails do you say one short, friendly sentence.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Resolve the category, gather listings, aggregate brands

1. **Ask the seller for the category** if it was not given — a category name, a
   category identifier, or a JoomPulse category link. If only a name is given,
   resolve it to the matching current category (and its depth level) with
   JoomPulse, and confirm the match with the seller if it is ambiguous.
2. **Use JoomPulse to fetch every active listing in the category**, with each
   listing's brand, estimated weekly sales and revenue, review count, and price.
   For a large category, broaden coverage in passes rather than silently capping —
   and if coverage is partial, say it was broad rather than presenting it as
   complete.
3. **Group the listings by brand and aggregate per brand.** Before grouping,
   **normalize brand names** — trim and unify casing, fold obvious variants and
   spellings of the same brand together, and standardize generic placeholders (for
   example "Outro" / "Sem marca") — so one brand is not split across rows. Use this
   same canonical form again when matching brands across periods. Drop listings
   with no brand; if unbranded listings are material, mention how many had no brand
   rather than letting an unnamed bucket top the ranking. For each brand compute:
   - **GMV estimado (semana)** — total estimated weekly revenue across the brand's
     listings.
   - **Vendas est. (semana)** — total estimated weekly sales across the listings.
   - **Anúncios** — number of active listings for the brand.
   - **Avaliações** — total review count (real history).
   - **Preço médio** — average listing price (optional supporting column).
4. **Rank the brands by estimated weekly revenue, descending,** to assign each
   brand its position (1 = top). If the seller asks to rank by units sold instead,
   rank by estimated weekly sales and say so. Keep roughly the top 20–30 brands
   for the table.

### Step 2 — Present today's ranking and offer it for download

Render today's brand-ranking table (head it with the category name and the date).
This table is the deliverable. **Where the client can produce files, also offer
it as a downloadable `.csv` / `.xlsx`** so the user can save it and bring it
back next period as the baseline; where it cannot, the markdown table stands on
its own — never offer a download you cannot deliver. On a standalone ranking
there is **no movement column and no legend** — just the ranking.

### Step 3 — Offer comparison, and compare if a previous table is supplied

Invite the user to send a previous brand table for the same category to compare
positions. **If they provide one**, match brands by canonical name (see Step 1)
and for each brand compare its previous position with its current one:

- rose N places → rose by N
- fell N places → fell by N
- same position → unchanged
- not in the previous table → new
- in the previous table but absent now → list it below the table as *"saiu do
  ranking"* — do not fabricate a position for it.

A position change **requires both a previous and a current position** for the same
brand — never invent a trend. If no previous table is supplied, the ranking stands
on its own (no movement column) and the user is told to save it for next time.

## Output

Respond in the language of the seller's request (pt-BR by default), with no
commentary about how the result was produced. Use plain markdown so it renders
cleanly in any client.

There is **one canonical brand-ranking table**, used everywhere (in the response
text and mirrored by the downloadable file). One row per brand, sorted by current
position, with these columns:

- **Posição** — current rank (1, 2, 3 …).
- **Variação** — *(comparison only)* how the brand's position moved versus the
  supplied previous table. **Omit this column entirely on a standalone ranking** —
  with no previous table there is no movement to show.
- **Marca** — the brand.
- **GMV estimado (semana)** — the brand's estimated weekly revenue (estimate).
- **Vendas est. (semana)** — the brand's estimated weekly sales (estimate).
- **Anúncios** — listing count for the brand.
- **Avaliações** — total review count (real history).
- **Preço médio** — average listing price, or `—` if unavailable.

So a **standalone ranking** has the columns `Posição | Marca | GMV estimado
(semana) | Vendas est. (semana) | Anúncios | Avaliações | Preço médio`; a
**comparison** adds the `Variação` column right after `Posição`.

In the `Variação` cell (comparison only), mark each brand:

- 🟢 **subiu no ranking**
- 🔴 **caiu no ranking**
- 🆕 **novo** (não estava no ranking anterior)
- = **sem mudança**

The change column header is the **word `Variação`** — never a bare delta symbol.

A category has no JoomPulse page, so the table carries no category link — never
build one from a categoryId. On a comparison, state
the period being compared (for example *"Comparado com a tabela de 12/06"*). On a
standalone ranking, invite the user to save the table and send it back next period
to see how positions moved.

**Disclaimer (every report):**

> ⚠️ **Vendas e receita são estimativas** do JoomPulse com base no histórico de
> anúncios — não são transações reais. **Avaliações são histórico real** do
> Mercado Livre.

## Visualization

**Render the visuals every time the data supports them.** As soon as the analysis
is done, present the cards and charts described below as a **self-contained visual
panel** — an artifact where the client renders artifacts, an inline widget where
it renders widgets. Do not ask permission first, do not describe the panel instead
of drawing it, and do not offer it as an optional extra: the cards and charts are
part of the answer, not a follow-up.

- **Order:** the cards first, then the charts, then the written read.
- **The data table always stays markdown in the response text**, never inside the
  panel — the panel carries cards and charts only.
- **The estimate disclaimer always stays in the response text** as well.
- **Skip an individual chart when its own data threshold is not met** (each
  threshold is stated below): a chart nobody can read is worse than no chart.
  Skipping one chart never means skipping the panel.
- **Only the cards and charts specified below.** Do not invent extra ones, and do
  not promote a categorical value to a bar — a chip or plain text is the honest
  rendering for it.
- **If no visual surface is available at all**, fall back to the markdown table
  plus the same figures written as text cards. Never block on visuals, and never
  leave the answer without its numbers.

**The panel contains:**

- **Three cards:**
  - **Marcas ativas** — the number of named brands in the ranking.
  - **Líder** — the #1 brand's name and its **share %** of total estimated weekly
    revenue across the ranked brands.
  - **Maior alta** — the brand that climbed the most and how many positions it
    rose. **Only with a comparison** (a previous table supplied); on a standalone
    ranking, drop this card or replace it with a neutral one — for example **GMV
    total estimado (semana)** of the ranked brands — never fabricate a rise.
- **Horizontal bar chart:** the top ~10 brands by **GMV estimado (semana)**,
  descending. Use a neutral single-hue ramp — this bar ranks size, it does not
  signal good or bad, so no semantic green/red.

**Tables always render as markdown,** on every surface — the ranked table lives in
the response text, never inside a rendered visual.

### Ranked table (always markdown, both surfaces)

The ranked table is the **one canonical brand-ranking table defined in Output** —
the same columns on every surface. It lives in the response text, never inside
a rendered visual.

The column headers, labels and disclaimers below are written in pt-BR because
that is the default. They are a template, not literal strings: when the seller
writes in another language, translate all of them — the headers, row values
such as `sim` / `não` / `ouro`, and the disclaimer — and keep the structure,
the emoji and the `R$` money formatting, which stays the same in every language
because the marketplace trades in reais. When the request is in English, no
Portuguese is left anywhere in the answer.

- **Standalone ranking:** columns `Posição | Marca | GMV estimado (semana) |
  Vendas est. (semana) | Anúncios | Avaliações | Preço médio` — **no `Variação`
  column and no legend** (with no symbols in the table a legend only adds noise).
- **Comparison (a previous table supplied):** add the `Variação` column right after
  `Posição`. The change column header is the **word `Variação`** — never a bare
  delta symbol. Cell markers:
  - 🟢 **subiu no ranking**
  - 🔴 **caiu no ranking**
  - 🆕 **novo** (não estava no ranking anterior)
  - = **sem mudança**
- **Show the marker legend (🟢 / 🔴 / 🆕 / =) only in the comparison**, where those
  markers actually appear — never on a standalone ranking.

Render the bar chart only when the data supports it; if there are too few brands
to be meaningful, skip the chart and keep the table.

**Formatting (both surfaces):** round numbers and format in pt-BR — revenue as
`R$ 1,2 mi` / `R$ 850 mil` / `R$ 4.300`; counts with `.` as the thousands
separator (`1.250`). Keep the ⚠️ estimate disclaimer on every output.

## Notes & Guardrails

The seller should never see a system or stack error — only a friendly next step.

- **The seller asks about Shopee:** say plainly that Shopee brand data is too
  incomplete to rank — only items with tracked sales carry a brand, so a
  leaderboard would look authoritative while missing whole brands. Do not produce a
  Shopee brand ranking or brand share. Offer instead what Shopee data does support:
  category structure and concentration, or the best-selling items in the category.
  If the marketplace is unclear, ask first — an identifier beginning `MLB` is
  Mercado Livre, a bare 10–11 digit number is Shopee.
- **No category given or an ambiguous name:** ask for the category (name,
  identifier, or JoomPulse link) before going further.
- **No active listings or no brands in the category:** say no brand data is
  available for this category right now, and offer to try a different or broader
  category.
- **Mostly unbranded listings:** rank only the named brands, and mention how many
  listings had no brand rather than letting an unnamed bucket dominate the top.
- **Market data temporarily unavailable:** retry once quietly; if it is still
  down, say market data is temporarily unavailable and suggest re-running. Never
  paste internal error text, HTTP codes, or field names to the seller.
- **No previous table supplied:** render today's ranking only (no movement column,
  no legend) and invite the user to save it for next time.
- **Supplied table is for a different category, malformed, or unreadable:** say so
  plainly and fall back to the standalone ranking; do not force a misaligned
  comparison.
- **Never silently limit coverage** — if the category is large and only part of it
  was scanned, say the coverage was broad rather than presenting it as complete.
