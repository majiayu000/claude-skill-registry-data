# Save Play Library Skill

## When to Use
- Translating retention signals into specific remediation actions.
- Coordinating lifecycle marketing and CS teams on who does what.
- Measuring effectiveness of save plays over time.

## Framework
1. **Signal Definition** – map triggers (drop in usage, support surge, NPS drop) to play categories.
2. **Play Blueprint** – outline objective, audience, messaging, channels, and required assets.
3. **Owner Matrix** – assign owners (CSM, lifecycle marketer, exec sponsor) with SLAs.
4. **Measurement Plan** – specify KPIs, experiment windows, and success criteria.
5. **Feedback Loop** – capture results, learnings, and iterate on play details.

## Templates
- Play card (trigger, action steps, assets, KPI, owner).
- Experiment tracker with control/test cohorts.
- Post-play retrospective form.

## Tips
- Keep plays modular so they can stack (email + exec outreach + offer).
- Include links to enablement assets for quick execution.
- Pair with `retention-dashboard` to trigger plays automatically when thresholds trip.
