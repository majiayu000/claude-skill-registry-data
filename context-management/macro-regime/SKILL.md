## Defaults

| Parameter | Default Value | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| lookback_quarters | 8 | 2yr captures cycle inflection while remaining responsive |
| regime_indicators | yield_curve, credit_spreads, PMI, VIX, fed_posture | Standard macro regime detection set |
| probability_weighting | bear/base/bull | Three-scenario framework per institutional standard |

## Preflight


Run canonical pre-flight per `contracts/preflight.md`.
Include the `X-Agentii-Trace` header on every tool call per `contracts/x-agentii-trace-header.md` — carry the `_run_id` from your first tool result and name yourself (and your parent, if you were spawned).

## Data Source Priority (mandatory order)

1. Knowledge entries FIRST — query gold.knowledge_entries for L1 regime frameworks
2. Historical analogues SECOND — query search_by_analogue(market_regime) for matching cases
3. Real-time data LAST — supplemental only

## Methodology

### Retrieval Scope
structured_only

### Retrieval Strategy
1. Query knowledge entries for L1 frameworks via search_knowledge_entries
2. Query search_by_analogue for historical regime precedents
3. Supplement with real-time data

### Temporal Scope
See frontmatter temporal_scope block.

### Tool Allowlist
See frontmatter allowed_tools.

### Protocol
1. Regime Detection — classify current macro environment using yield curve, credit spreads, PMI, VIX, Fed posture
2. Framework Application — apply relevant L1 framework from references/knowledge-frameworks.md
3. Analogue Retrieval — query search_by_analogue(market_regime) for historical precedents
4. Probability Weighting — Bear/Base/Bull scenarios with transition catalysts

## Output File

`{ticker}/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_macro-regime_{affix}.md`

## Output Structure

1. Executive Summary — current regime with probability weights
2. Regime Indicators — yield curve, credit spreads, PMI, VIX with readings
3. Framework Analysis — applied L1 frameworks with evidence
4. Historical Analogues — matched cases with /v/cases/ citations
5. Scenario Matrix — Bear/Base/Bull with catalysts
6. Risk Factors and Coverage Gaps

## Error Handling

| Error | Fallback |
|-------|----------|
| No L1 frameworks | Proceed with standard indicators; flag degraded |
| search_by_analogue empty | Note no analogue found; do not fabricate |
| Real-time quote unavailable | Use last-known values with staleness flag |
