## Defaults

| Parameter | Default Value | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| parameter_free | true | This skill has no tunable parameters; analysis scope set by temporal_scope frontmatter |

## Preflight

Run canonical pre-flight per `contracts/preflight.md`. Include the `X-Agentii-Trace` header on every tool call per `contracts/x-agentii-trace-header.md` — carry the `_run_id` from your first tool result and name yourself (and your parent, if you were spawned).

## Methodology

### Retrieval Scope
structured_only

### Retrieval Strategy
Query knowledge entries for relevant frameworks; query search_by_analogue for historical cases.

### Temporal Scope
See frontmatter temporal_scope block.

### Tool Allowlist
See frontmatter allowed_tools.

### Protocol
See ## Protocol section below.



# Technical Execution (Entry/Exit Timing)

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT (FR-021)**: Technical analysis is NOT a trade initiator. Investment ideas originate from L1 (macro), L2 (fundamental), or L3 (strategy). This skill serves ONLY entry/exit timing — when to buy, when to sell, how to manage the position. Never use technical patterns as the primary reason to enter a trade.

## Preflight
Run the canonical pre-flight sequence. See `contracts/preflight.md`. Verify the analysis request has an existing investment thesis from L1/L2/L3 before proceeding.

## Protocol
1. **Thesis Anchoring** — identify the originating investment thesis (which L1/L2/L3 skill produced it)
2. **Entry Timing** — apply L4 frameworks (Wyckoff, Market Profile, volume analysis) to optimize entry
3. **Exit Planning** — define profit targets and stop levels based on market structure
4. **Trade Management** — scaling in/out plan, position adjustment triggers

## Methodology

### Retrieval Scope
structured_only

### Retrieval Strategy
Query gold.knowledge_entries for frameworks; query search_by_analogue for historical cases.

### Temporal Scope

### Tool Allowlist

## Output File
`{ticker}/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_technical-execution_{affix}.md`

## Output Structure

1. **Executive Summary** — key findings in 2-3 sentences
2. **Framework Analysis** — applied frameworks with specific findings
3. **Quantitative Metrics** — relevant calculations and benchmarks
4. **Historical Analogues** — matched cases with citations
5. **Risk Assessment** — key risk factors and mitigants
6. **Coverage Gaps** — data limitations and degraded flags
1. Originating Thesis Reference 2. Entry Analysis 3. Exit Plan 4. Trade Management 5. Risk Controls

## Error Handling
| No originating thesis from L1/L2/L3 | HALT — do not proceed; technical analysis is not a trade initiator |
