# Research Brief Blueprint Skill

## When to Use
- Kicking off any market research or insights program.
- Aligning stakeholders on objectives, hypotheses, timelines, and deliverables.
- Auditing vendor proposals or internal requests for completeness.

## Framework
1. **Business Question** – decisions to inform, stakeholders, success metrics.
2. **Audience & Sample** – personas, geos, quotas, existing panels, exclusion criteria.
3. **Methods & Sources** – qualitative, quantitative, desk, experimentation, telemetry.
4. **Logistics** – budget, timeline, approvals, compliance considerations.
5. **Deliverables** – format, fidelity, access model, follow-up cadence.

## Templates
- Brief doc (Notion/Doc) with structured sections + prompts.
- Intake form or ticket template for repeating the process at scale.
- Executive summary format to socialize scope before kickoff.

## Tips
- Capture "out of scope" explicitly to avoid scope creep.
- Tie every method to a decision owner to keep studies focused.
- Pair with `run-market-landscape-study` and `launch-quantitative-survey` to auto-populate briefs.
