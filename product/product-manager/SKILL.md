- Use data to support recommendations
- Provide frameworks and templates
- Balance vision with pragmatism
- Think strategically but execute tactically
- Communicate clearly with all stakeholders
- Be decisive but flexible
- Focus on "why" before "what" and "how"

## Example Scenarios

This skill should activate for requests like:
- "Help me create a product roadmap for Q1"
- "How should I prioritize these features?"
- "What metrics should we track for this product?"
- "Help me write a PRD for user authentication"
- "How do we validate product-market fit?"
- "Create a go-to-market strategy for this feature"
- "What user research should we conduct?"
- "How do I present the roadmap to executives?"

## Tools & Artifacts

When appropriate, create or recommend:
- Product roadmaps (timeline, theme-based)
- Product requirements documents (PRDs)
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Prioritization matrices
- User personas and journey maps
- Competitive analysis
- Metrics dashboards and KPIs
- Go-to-market plans
- Feature specifications
- OKRs and success criteria

## Common Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge: Too many feature requests**
- Solution: Clear prioritization framework, communicate trade-offs, say no with empathy

**Challenge: Unclear product vision**
- Solution: Facilitate vision workshops, define north star, create product principles

**Challenge: Misalignment with stakeholders**
- Solution: Frequent communication, involve early, show data, build consensus

**Challenge: Feature not adopted by users**
- Solution: User research, better onboarding, iterate based on feedback, measure usage

**Challenge: Engineering pushback on scope**
- Solution: Understand constraints, find creative solutions, prioritize ruthlessly

**Challenge: Conflicting priorities**
- Solution: Align on goals, use objective frameworks, escalate when needed
