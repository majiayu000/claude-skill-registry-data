# PM-Skills — AI OS for Product Managers

> *"65 skills, 36 commands, 8 plugins — encoding the best PM frameworks into AI."*

PM-Skills is an AI operating system for product managers built as Claude Code plugins.
It encodes the best PM methodologies from Teresa Torres (Opportunity Solution Trees),
Marty Cagan (SVPG), Alberto Savoia (Pretotyping), and other thought leaders into
structured AI skills ready to drive real product work.

## When to use this skill

- Writing user stories, PRDs, or product specs from scratch
- Running product discovery (opportunity mapping, assumption testing)
- Defining product strategy (north star, vision, OKRs)
- Planning and executing go-to-market launches
- Conducting market research and competitive analysis
- Setting up sprint planning, backlog grooming, or retrospectives
- Analyzing data to extract product insights
- Pretotyping and validating ideas before building

## 8 Plugins

| Plugin | Skills | Core Focus |
|--------|--------|------------|
| `pm-product-discovery` | 13 skills | Teresa Torres OST, opportunity mapping, assumption testing |
| `pm-product-strategy` | 12 skills | Vision, north star, OKRs, business model, competitive moat |
| `pm-execution` | 15 skills | PRD writing, user stories, sprint planning, backlog grooming |
| `pm-market-research` | 7 skills | Customer interviews, JTBD, competitive analysis, persona creation |
| `pm-data-analytics` | 3 skills | Metrics framework, funnel analysis, A/B testing guide |
| `pm-go-to-market` | 6 skills | Launch planning, positioning, pricing, channel strategy |
| `pm-marketing-growth` | 5 skills | Growth loops, retention frameworks, activation playbook |
| `pm-toolkit` | 4 skills | Stakeholder communication, meeting facilitation, PM templates |

## Instructions

Invoke this skill by mentioning a PM task or using any of the slash commands below.
The skill routes your request to the appropriate plugin and framework automatically.

1. Describe your product challenge in natural language, or use a slash command directly.
2. The skill selects the relevant PM framework (OST, JTBD, Pretotyping, etc.) and guides you through it.
3. Output is structured and ready to paste into Notion, Jira, or your doc tool of choice.

Start with `/discover` for new features, `/write-prd` for specs, or `/north-star` for strategy.

**Catalog note (jeo-skills, 2026-09-19):** three upstream plugin skills are merged into the
catalog's canonical project-management skills instead of shipping twice — `/retro` →
`sprint-retrospective`, release notes → `changelog-maintenance`, `/sprint` (`sprint-plan`) →
`task-planning` (`references/sprint-planning-recipe.md`). The old names are listed in
`skills.json` `retired_skills` and still resolve at `jeo-skill install` time.

## Core Frameworks Encoded

### Opportunity Solution Tree (Teresa Torres)
PM-Skills encodes Teresa Torres's continuous discovery framework:
1. **Desired Outcome** → Define the north star and business outcome
2. **Opportunities** → Map customer problems, needs, desires (the "why")
3. **Solutions** → Brainstorm solutions per opportunity (the "what")
4. **Experiments** → Design assumption tests (the "how to validate")

Use `/discover` to start the tree interactively.

### Inspired / Empowered (Marty Cagan)
Strategy and execution principles from SVPG:
- Outcome-based roadmaps, not feature lists
- Product trio: PM + Designer + Engineer in discovery
- Distinguish discovery risk from delivery risk

### Pretotyping (Alberto Savoia)
Validate demand before building:
- Use `/run-experiment` to design lightweight experiments
- Mechanical Turk, Impersonator, Pretend-to-Own patterns
- "Make sure you are building the right IT before you build IT right"

## Workflow Example: New Feature Discovery

```bash
# 1. Start opportunity mapping
/discover "reduce user churn"

# 2. Run customer interviews to validate opportunities
/interview-guide "churned users"

# 3. Score and prioritize the best opportunity
/opportunity-score

# 4. Design assumption tests before building
/run-experiment "users want async collaboration"

# 5. Write the PRD once assumptions are validated
/write-prd "async collaboration feature"

# 6. Break into user stories
/write-stories

# 7. Plan the sprint
/sprint
```

## Best practices

- **Discovery before execution**: Always run `/discover` before writing PRDs
- **JTBD framing**: Frame requirements with `/jobs-to-be-done` to stay customer-centric
- **Assumption-first**: Use `/map-assumptions` to surface risks before committing
- **Outcome-based roadmap**: Define `/north-star` before building `/roadmap`
- **Continuous discovery**: Schedule `/interview-guide` regularly, not just at project start

## Framework Selection Guide

| Situation | Recommended Command | Framework |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| "What should we build?" | `/discover` | Teresa Torres OST |
| "Is there demand for this?" | `/run-experiment` | Alberto Savoia Pretotyping |
| "How do we measure success?" | `/north-star` | Marty Cagan North Star |
| "What's the business model?" | `/business-model` | Business Model Canvas |
| "How do we grow?" | `/growth-loops` | Growth Loops |
| "What are customers doing?" | `/jobs-to-be-done` | JTBD (Moesta) |
| "What are our risks?" | `/map-assumptions` | Assumption Mapping |
