## What I do
- Generate comprehensive project roadmaps with visual timeline representations
- Create release plans with clear milestones and deliverables
- Provide multiple roadmap formats (Gantt, timeline, Kanban, portfolio view)
- Include resource allocation and dependency visualization
- Enable stakeholder communication with clear progress tracking

## When to use me
Use when you need to:
- Create visual project timelines for stakeholder communication
- Plan releases and track major milestones
- Visualize project dependencies and critical paths
- Align teams around release schedules and delivery dates
- Communicate project progress to executives or clients

## How I work
1. **Timeline Analysis** - Parse project requirements and estimate durations
2. **Milestone Identification** - Define key deliverables and achievement markers
3. **Release Planning** - Structure work into logical releases and iterations
4. **Dependency Mapping** - Visualize task dependencies and critical paths
5. **Resource Allocation** - Plan team assignments and capacity utilization
6. **Risk Integration** - Include risk mitigation timelines and contingency planning
7. **Format Generation** - Create multiple visualization formats for different audiences
8. **Tracking Setup** - Define progress measurement and reporting mechanisms

## What I need
- Project requirements and feature breakdown (from feature-mapping)
- Team size, composition, and availability information
- Release timeline preferences or deadline constraints
- Milestone definitions and success criteria
- Any existing project constraints or dependencies

## What I produce
A comprehensive roadmap package containing:
- **Executive Timeline** - High-level project overview for stakeholders
- **Detailed Gantt Chart** - Task durations, dependencies, and critical paths
- **Release Roadmap** - Quarterly or monthly release plans with feature groupings
- **Sprint Calendar** - Detailed sprint planning with capacity allocation
- **Milestone Timeline** - Key delivery dates and achievement markers
- **Dependency Map** - Visual representation of project interdependencies
- **Resource Allocation Plan** - Team assignments and capacity utilization
- **Risk Timeline** - Risk mitigation schedules and contingency plans
- **Progress Tracking Framework** - Metrics, reporting frequency, and status indicators
- **Communication Calendar** - Stakeholder updates and review schedules

## Usage Example
```
"Create a 12-month roadmap for our mobile app launch with quarterly releases"
```

This will generate a complete visual roadmap package that aligns teams, communicates progress to stakeholders, and tracks delivery against milestones.
