# Customer Service SOP

## Framework

```
IRON LAW: Tier the Support, Not the Customer

Every customer deserves quality service. But not every issue needs a
senior specialist. Route by ISSUE COMPLEXITY, not by customer "importance."

L1 handles 70-80% of volume (simple, repeatable)
L2 handles 15-20% (requires expertise)
L3 handles 5% (requires engineering or management)
```

### Three-Tier Support Model

| Tier | Handles | Skills Required | Resolution Target |
|------|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **L1 (Basic)** | FAQ, order status, password reset, simple returns | Script-following, product basics, empathy | < 5 minutes, first-contact resolution |
| **L2 (Specialist)** | Technical issues, billing disputes, complex returns, product defects | Deep product knowledge, judgment, negotiation | < 24 hours |
| **L3 (Expert)** | System bugs, legal/compliance, executive escalations, crisis | Engineering, legal, or management involvement | < 72 hours, case-by-case |

### Case Categorization

| Category | Examples | Priority | SLA (First Response) |
|----------|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Critical** | Service outage, security breach, safety issue | P1 | < 15 minutes |
| **High** | Payment failure, account locked, order error | P2 | < 1 hour |
| **Medium** | Product question, feature request, general complaint | P3 | < 4 hours |
| **Low** | Feedback, suggestion, general inquiry | P4 | < 24 hours |

### Complaint Handling: LAST Framework

1. **Listen**: Let the customer express fully without interrupting
2. **Apologize**: Acknowledge their frustration sincerely ("I'm sorry this happened")
3. **Solve**: Offer a concrete solution or next step
4. **Thank**: Thank them for bringing it to your attention

### Escalation Rules

| Trigger | Escalate To | Timeline |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| L1 can't resolve in 15 min | L2 | Immediate warm handoff |
| Customer requests supervisor | L2 or Team Lead | Within 5 minutes |
| Issue involves refund > NT$X | L2 (approval authority) | Same interaction |
| Legal threat or media mention | L3 + Legal + PR | Immediate |
| Repeat contact (3+ on same issue) | L2 + investigation | After 3rd contact |

### Response Template Structure

```
[Greeting] Hi {name}, thank you for contacting us.

[Acknowledge] I understand you're experiencing {issue}.

[Action] Here's what I've done / Here's what we'll do:
1. {specific action}
2. {timeline}

[Next steps] {what the customer should expect / do next}

[Close] Is there anything else I can help you with?
```

## Gotchas

- **SLAs must be MEASURABLE**: "Respond quickly" is not an SLA. "First response within 1 hour for P2 tickets" is. If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.
- **Warm handoff > cold transfer**: When escalating, the L1 agent should brief L2 before transferring. Forcing the customer to repeat their story destroys satisfaction.
- **Empower L1 with resolution authority**: If L1 must escalate every refund, 70% of volume goes to L2 unnecessarily. Give L1 authority for refunds under a threshold (e.g., NT$500).
- **Templates are starting points, not scripts**: Robotic copy-paste responses feel worse than no response. Agents should personalize templates to the specific situation.
- **Taiwan CS expectations**: Taiwan customers expect fast LINE response (within minutes during business hours), polite and apologetic tone, and willingness to go the extra mile. The bar for "good service" is high.
