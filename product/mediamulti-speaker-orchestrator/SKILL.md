# Multi-Speaker Orchestrator

Capabilities
- dispatch_tts_segment: send text chunks to specific voice models.
- sync_audio_timing: insert/align pauses between turns.
- mix_audio_track: merge per-speaker audio into a single output (MP3/WAV).

Dependencies
- hybrid-orchestrator (flow control)
- canary-orchestration (safe rollout of new voices/pipelines)

Inputs
- scripted turns with speaker labels and optional prosody tags.

Outputs
- final mixed audio + timing metadata.

Usage
- Route each turn to its assigned voice model, align timing, then mix into a single deliverable. Use canary to test new voices before full deployment.
