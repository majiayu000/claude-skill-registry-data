# Brainstorming Features

## Overview

This skill helps generate, explore, and structure feature ideas for mobile and web applications through systematic ideation workflows. It produces actionable, well-organized feature concepts with technical context and user value.

## When to Use

- Planning new app features or product directions
- Exploring feature possibilities for existing apps
- Generating ideas for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Feature discovery workshops
- Product roadmap planning sessions
- Competitive feature analysis
- User problem-solving sessions

## Brainstorming Workflow

### 1. Context Gathering

Before generating ideas, understand:

**Project Context:**

- App type (mobile, web, desktop, PWA)
- Tech stack (React Native, Next.js, etc.)
- Target users and personas
- Core value proposition
- Existing features (if applicable)

**Brainstorming Scope:**

- Specific feature area or general exploration
- Problem to solve or opportunity to capture
- Constraints (technical, budget, timeline)
- Success metrics

### 2. Idea Generation Methods

**Method A - Problem-First:**

1. Identify user pain points
2. Generate solutions addressing each pain point
3. Rank by impact vs. effort
4. Select top 3-5 for detailed exploration

**Method B - Opportunity-First:**

1. List market opportunities or trends
2. Generate features leveraging opportunities
3. Assess feasibility and differentiation
4. Select promising concepts

**Method C - Competitive Analysis:**

1. Review competitor features
2. Identify gaps and improvements
3. Generate unique variations or enhancements
4. Prioritize by competitive advantage

**Method D - User Journey Mapping:**

1. Map current user journey
2. Identify friction points
3. Generate features smoothing the journey
4. Test against user flow improvements

### 3. Feature Structure Template

For each feature idea, provide:

```markdown
## Feature: [Feature Name]

**One-line description:**
[Brief, compelling description in 10-15 words]

**Problem it solves:**
[User pain point or opportunity addressed]

**Target users:**
[Primary and secondary user personas]

**User story:**
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

**Key capabilities:**

- Capability 1
- Capability 2
- Capability 3

**Technical considerations:**

- Technology/library suggestions
- Integration points
- Data requirements
- Potential challenges

**Implementation complexity:**
[Low / Medium / High] - [Brief justification]

**Expected impact:**
[User value and business value]

**Success metrics:**

- Metric 1 (e.g., engagement increase)
- Metric 2 (e.g., task completion rate)
```

### 4. Idea Refinement

After initial generation, refine ideas by:

**Feasibility Check:**

- Technical achievability with current stack
- Resource requirements (time, team, infrastructure)
- Dependencies on other features or systems

**Value Assessment:**

- User value score (1-10)
- Business value score (1-10)
- Effort estimate (person-days or story points)

**Prioritization Matrix:**

```
High Value, Low Effort  → Do First (Quick Wins)
High Value, High Effort → Strategic Investments
Low Value, Low Effort   → Consider Later
Low Value, High Effort  → Avoid
```

### 5. Output Formats

**Format 1 - Feature Brief (Detailed):**
Use the full template above for 3-5 top features

**Format 2 - Feature List (Concise):**

```markdown
1. **[Feature Name]** - [One-line description] [Complexity: Low/Med/High]
2. **[Feature Name]** - [One-line description] [Complexity: Low/Med/High]
   ...
```

**Format 3 - Feature Roadmap:**
Organize by phases or sprints:

```markdown
### Phase 1 - Foundation (Sprint 1-2)

- Feature A (enables core workflow)
- Feature B (critical user need)

### Phase 2 - Enhancement (Sprint 3-4)

- Feature C (improves experience)
- Feature D (adds value)

### Phase 3 - Advanced (Sprint 5+)

- Feature E (differentiator)
- Feature F (scale optimization)
```

## Examples

### Example 1 - Mobile Note-Taking App

**Context:** React Native note-taking app for nursing students

**Brainstorm Request:** "Generate 5 feature ideas to improve study efficiency"

**Output:**

```markdown
## Feature: AI-Powered Flashcard Generation

**One-line description:**
Automatically create study flashcards from notes using AI term extraction

**Problem it solves:**
Students spend hours manually creating flashcards instead of studying

**Target users:**
Nursing students preparing for exams and clinical rotations

**User story:**
As a nursing student, I want my notes automatically converted to flashcards so that I can focus on studying instead of card creation.

**Key capabilities:**

- Auto-detect medical terms and concepts
- Generate question-answer pairs from context
- Spaced repetition scheduling
- Manual edit and refinement

**Technical considerations:**

- OpenAI API for term extraction
- IndexedDB/Dexie for local flashcard storage
- Background processing for large notes
- Offline-first sync with Firestore

**Implementation complexity:**
Medium - Requires AI integration and smart parsing logic, but leverages existing note structure

**Expected impact:**

- 70% reduction in flashcard creation time
- Increased study time availability
- Higher exam preparation quality

**Success metrics:**

- Flashcards generated per note
- User edits to auto-generated cards (lower = better accuracy)
- Study session frequency increase
```

- Start broad, then narrow to specific features
- Consider technical feasibility early
- Include user value in every idea
- Provide clear prioritization rationale
- Use concrete examples over abstract concepts
- Balance innovation with practicality

### Don't:

- Generate ideas without context
- Ignore technical constraints
- Overlook existing features or patterns
- Skip impact assessment
- Propose features without user stories
- Forget about implementation complexity
