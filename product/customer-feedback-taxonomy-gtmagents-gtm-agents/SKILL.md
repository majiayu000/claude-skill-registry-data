# Customer Feedback Taxonomy Skill

## When to Use
- Normalizing surveys, interviews, support logs, or community chatter before synthesis.
- Auditing existing VoC datasets for drift or inconsistencies.
- Onboarding new teams to shared tagging standards.

## Framework
1. **Persona Layer** – map ICP, role, and influence level.
2. **Lifecycle Layer** – awareness, onboarding, adoption, expansion, renewal, advocacy.
3. **Driver Layer** – product, service, pricing, experience, relationship, outcomes.
4. **Sentiment Layer** – strength, urgency, confidence, sample size.
5. **Metadata Layer** – ARR, region, industry, channel, last touch.

## Templates
- CSV/Sheet taxonomy with dropdowns and validation rules.
- JSON schema for tagging automation or webhook ingestion.
- Governance checklist for quarterly taxonomy refresh.

## Tips
- Keep taxonomy lean (<30 drivers) to encourage adoption.
- Version every change so historical analyses remain comparable.
- Pair with `run-voc-listening-tour` to auto-tag new signals.
