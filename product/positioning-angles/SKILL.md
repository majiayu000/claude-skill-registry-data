# Positioning Angles

This skill identifies unique, defensible market positions that make a brand memorable and different - not just another option in a crowded category.

## Objective

Find the positioning angle that gives the brand unfair advantage: a market position competitors can't or won't copy, that resonates deeply with the target audience.

**The Core Principle**: Effective positioning requires saying something a reasonable person could disagree with. If everyone in the category claims it, it's not a position - it's a table stake.

## Intake Questions

Before exploring positioning frameworks, gather context:

1. **Product/service**: What exactly does the brand offer? Core features and capabilities?
2. **Current positioning**: How is it currently described? What's the elevator pitch today?
3. **Target audience**: Who is the ideal customer? Be specific (demographics, psychographics, behaviors).
4. **Competitors**: Who are the top 3-5 alternatives? How do they position themselves?
5. **Unique strengths**: What does this brand do better than anyone else? What's unfair advantage?
6. **Customer feedback**: What do happy customers say? What words do they use?
7. **Origin story**: Why was this created? What problem was the founder solving?

## The 8 Positioning Frameworks

### 1. Challenger Brand
**Best for**: Established markets with dominant players

Position against the market leader by attacking their weakness or reframing the category.

**Template**: "Unlike [leader] who [their approach], we [your different approach] because [reason it matters]."

**Example**: "Unlike big banks that treat you like a number, we know your name and your goals."

### 2. Category Creation
**Best for**: Truly novel products, new approaches to old problems

Create and own a new category rather than competing in an existing one.

**Template**: "We're not a [existing category]. We're the first [new category] that [key differentiator]."

**Example**: "We're not a CRM. We're a Revenue Intelligence Platform that predicts your deals."

### 3. Niche Domination
**Best for**: Broad markets with underserved segments

Own a specific vertical, use case, or customer segment completely.

**Template**: "The only [product type] built specifically for [niche segment]."

**Example**: "The only accounting software built specifically for freelance photographers."

### 4. Value Proposition Canvas
**Best for**: Customer-centric positioning, product-market fit

Map customer jobs, pains, and gains to product features, pain relievers, and gain creators.

**Structure**:
- **Customer Jobs**: What are they trying to accomplish?
- **Pains**: What frustrates them about current solutions?
- **Gains**: What would make their life better?
- **Pain Relievers**: How do you eliminate their frustrations?
- **Gain Creators**: How do you deliver desired outcomes?

### 5. Competitive Positioning Matrix
**Best for**: Crowded markets, clear differentiation

Plot competitors on two axes that matter to customers, then own an unoccupied quadrant.

**Process**:
1. List what customers care about most
2. Select two dimensions competitors vary on
3. Plot all competitors on the 2x2 matrix
4. Identify the empty or underserved quadrant
5. Position there if you can authentically deliver

**Example Axes**: Price/Quality, Simple/Powerful, Traditional/Modern, Fast/Thorough

### 6. Geoffrey Moore's Positioning Template
**Best for**: B2B products, technical products, investor pitches

The classic fill-in-the-blank framework:

**Template**:
"For [target customer]
who [statement of need or opportunity],
[product name] is a [product category]
that [key benefit/reason to buy].
Unlike [primary competitive alternative],
our product [primary differentiation]."

### 7. Blue Ocean Strategy
**Best for**: Commoditized markets, breakthrough positioning

Find uncontested market space by eliminating, reducing, raising, or creating factors.

**Four Actions Framework**:
- **Eliminate**: What factors can you eliminate that the industry takes for granted?
- **Reduce**: What factors can you reduce well below industry standard?
- **Raise**: What factors can you raise well above industry standard?
- **Create**: What factors can you create that the industry has never offered?

### 8. Jobs-to-be-Done
**Best for**: Outcome-focused positioning, crossing category boundaries

Position around the outcome customers hire your product to achieve, not features.

**Template**: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."

**Positioning statement**: "We help [customer] [achieve outcome] when [trigger situation]."

**Example**: "We help busy professionals feel put-together when they have 10 minutes to dress."
