# A/B Test Planner

## When to Use

- Before running any product experiment or feature test
- When optimizing conversion funnels or UX flows
- When leadership requires statistical rigor for feature decisions
- When planning multi-variant tests or sequential experiments

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Hypothesis

Write a clear, falsifiable hypothesis:
- **If** [change we're making]
- **Then** [metric we expect to change]
- **Because** [reasoning / user insight]

### Step 2 — Metrics

| Type | Metric | Current Baseline |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Primary** | The metric that determines success | [value] |
| **Secondary** | Supporting metrics that provide context | [value] |
| **Guardrail** | Metrics that must NOT degrade | [value] |

### Step 3 — Sample Size & Duration

Calculate required sample size using:
- Baseline conversion rate (p₁)
- Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) — smallest meaningful change
- Statistical significance level (α) — typically 0.05
- Statistical power (1−β) — typically 0.80

`n = f(p₁, MDE, α, β)` → use standard sample size calculator

Duration = n / (daily traffic × allocation %)

### Step 4 — Randomization Plan

1. Randomization unit: user, session, device, or account
2. Allocation: 50/50, or asymmetric with justification
3. Stratification: any segments to balance (geography, plan, device)
4. Exclusion: users to exclude (employees, bots, existing tests)

### Step 5 — Decision Rules

| Outcome | Criteria | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Winner** | Primary metric ↑ ≥ MDE, p < 0.05, guardrails stable | Ship to 100% |
| **Neutral** | No significant difference | Keep control, iterate hypothesis |
| **Loser** | Primary metric ↓ significantly | Revert, analyze why |
| **Guardrail breach** | Any guardrail metric degrades > threshold | Stop test immediately |

### Step 6 — Rollout Playbook

1. Ramp: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100% over [days]
2. Monitoring: check metrics daily during ramp
3. Rollback trigger: guardrail breach or unexpected anomaly

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Format |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Change description | Yes | What is being tested |
| Baseline metric | Yes | Current value |
| MDE target | Yes | Percentage or absolute |
| Daily traffic | Yes | Number of users/events |
| Test duration budget | Recommended | Max days willing to run |

## Output

```markdown
## A/B Test Plan — [Test Name]

### Hypothesis
If we simplify the checkout form from 5 fields to 3 fields,
then checkout completion rate will increase by ≥ 5%,
because user research shows 40% abandon at the address step.

### Metrics

| Type | Metric | Baseline | Target |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| Primary | Checkout completion rate | 45% | ≥ 50% |
| Secondary | Average order value | $65 | Stable |
| Guardrail | Revenue per user | $12 | No decrease |
| Guardrail | Error rate | 0.5% | No increase |

### Sample Size

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Baseline rate | 45% |
| MDE | 5% (absolute) |
| Significance (α) | 0.05 |
| Power (1−β) | 0.80 |
| Required n per variant | ~1,600 |
| Daily traffic | 800 users |
| Allocation | 50/50 |
| **Estimated duration** | **4 days** |

### Randomization
- Unit: User (cookie-based)
- Allocation: 50% control / 50% variant
- Exclusion: Internal users, users in other active tests

### Decision Rules
[As defined in procedure]

### Rollout Playbook
Day 1–2: 10% ramp → monitor → Day 3–4: 50% → Day 5: 100%
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Hypothesis is clear and falsifiable
- [ ] Primary, secondary, and guardrail metrics defined
- [ ] Sample size calculated with stated parameters
- [ ] Duration estimated based on traffic
- [ ] Randomization plan documented
- [ ] Decision rules and rollout playbook included

## Examples

### Prompt

```text
We want to test if a new onboarding flow increases activation rate.
Current activation: 32%. MDE: 3 percentage points. Daily new users: 500.
We have max 14 days for the test.
Design a complete A/B test plan with sample size and decision rules.
```

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Every finding is tied to a specific evidence source (log, test, metric)
- [ ] Pass/fail criteria are binary and measurable — no subjective judgments
- [ ] Severity levels are assigned with clear thresholds
- [ ] Remediation steps are provided for all critical and high findings

## Verification (4C)

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Are all pass/fail criteria applied against the correct standard or rule? |
| **Completeness** | Were all required dimensions or checklist items evaluated? |
| **Context-fit** | Does the verification scope match the actual risk level of the deliverable? |
| **Consequence** | If this passed verification but had a hidden flaw, what is the worst-case impact? |

## Edge Cases

- **Incomplete data for full assessment** — Document which checks were limited and flag for re-verification when data becomes available.
- **Ambiguous pass/fail criteria** — Request clarification from the standard owner before scoring. Mark as 'Needs Review'.
- **Multiple overlapping standards** — Identify the governing standard and note where others diverge.
