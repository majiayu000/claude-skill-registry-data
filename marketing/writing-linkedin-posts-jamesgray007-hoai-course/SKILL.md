# LinkedIn Post Writer

Create engaging, authentic LinkedIn posts that drive meaningful engagement and establish thought leadership.

## Core Principles

### Authenticity Over Performance

LinkedIn has matured. Readers can spot manufactured vulnerability and engagement bait instantly. The posts that resonate now are genuinely useful or genuinely human—not optimized for virality.

What works:
- Real experiences with honest reflection
- Specific insights from your actual work
- Admitting what you don't know
- Sharing without needing validation

What doesn't:
- Performed vulnerability for engagement
- Stories that feel too perfectly structured
- Lessons that sound like motivational posters

### One Idea Per Post

The biggest mistake is cramming multiple tips, stories, or angles into one post. Focus on:
- One core idea
- One story
- One insight
- One lesson

If you have five points, that's five posts.

### Value Without Strings

Every post must educate, inspire, or entertain. Ask: "Would I find this valuable if a stranger posted it?" Not "Will this get engagement?"

## Building Your Signature Voice

Top Voices don't just post well—they're recognizable. Their perspective, style, and focus areas are consistent.

### Define Your POV

Answer these before writing:
- What topic do I have genuine expertise in?
- What's my contrarian belief in my industry?
- What perspective do I bring that others don't?
- What would I want to be known for saying?

### Consistency Markers

Develop 2-3 recognizable elements:
- A recurring theme or topic area
- A consistent tone (analytical, warm, direct, witty)
- A signature format you're known for
- Phrases or frameworks you've coined

### Voice Calibration

Your LinkedIn voice should be:
- More polished than a text to a friend
- Less formal than a company memo
- As smart as your best work conversations
- As human as your real personality

## Post Anatomy

### The Hook (Lines 1-2)

The first 2-3 lines appear before "See more" and determine everything.

**Modern hooks that work** (avoid overused patterns):

| Type | Example | Why It Works |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Honest admission** | "I've been wrong about remote work." | Genuine, not performed |
| **Specific observation** | "I've noticed something in every founder who scaled past $10M." | Credibility + curiosity |
| **Direct challenge** | "Most career advice optimizes for the wrong thing." | Provokes thought |
| **Unexpected angle** | "The best hire I made had the worst resume." | Subverts expectations |
| **Simple truth** | "Nobody talks about how lonely leadership is." | Resonates emotionally |

**Hooks to retire**:
- "This one thing made me $X" (feels like a scam ad)
- "The CEO pulled me aside and said..." (overused curiosity bait)
- "I'm excited to announce..." (corporate and skippable)
- "[Number] words that changed my life" (too formulaic)

See `references/hooks.md` for comprehensive examples.

### The Body

Structure for scannability:
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- Line breaks between thoughts
- Bullet points for lists (but don't overuse)
- Bold for emphasis sparingly

**Storytelling framework**:
1. Set the scene (briefly—one sentence)
2. Introduce tension or conflict
3. Show the turning point
4. Deliver the insight
5. Make it applicable to the reader

### The Close

End with purpose, not desperation:

**Good closes**:
- Genuine question that invites perspective
- Specific call to action ("Bookmark this for your next negotiation")
- Reflection that lingers ("Something to sit with this week")

**Avoid**:
- "Agree?" (lazy)
- "Comment YES if..." (engagement bait)
- "Share this with someone who needs it" (needy)
- "Follow me for more" (salesy)

## Vulnerability Done Right

Authentic sharing builds connection. Performed vulnerability destroys trust.

### Strategic Vulnerability vs. Exploitation

**Share when**:
- The experience taught you something others can learn
- You've processed it enough to offer perspective
- It serves the reader, not your need for validation
- Time has passed and you have hindsight

**Don't share when**:
- The wound is still fresh
- You're seeking sympathy, not providing value
- It could harm others involved
- It feels performative even to you

### The Vulnerability Test

Before posting something personal, ask:
1. Am I sharing this to help others or to process my own feelings?
2. Would I be comfortable if this went viral?
3. Does this include genuine insight or just pain?
4. Have I protected others who were involved?

## Post Formats

### Story Post
Best for: Personal experiences, lessons learned, career moments

```
[Hook - honest admission or surprising outcome]

[One sentence of context]

[What happened - the tension or challenge]

[The turning point]

[What you learned]

[Question or reflection for reader]
```

### List Post
Best for: Frameworks, actionable advice, curated insights

```
[Hook - clear value promise]

[Why this matters - one sentence]

1. [Point with brief context]
2. [Point with brief context]
3. [Point with brief context]
(3-7 items max)

[Closing insight or question]
```

### Contrarian Post
Best for: Challenging conventional wisdom (with substance)

```
[Your contrarian position, stated directly]

[The common belief you're challenging]

[Your reasoning - why you see it differently]

[Evidence or experience]

[Nuanced conclusion - acknowledge complexity]

[Invite discussion]
```

**Contrarian guardrails**:
- Have genuine expertise on the topic
- Argue against ideas, not people
- Offer an alternative, not just criticism
- Acknowledge what the other side gets right
- Be open to being wrong

### Observation Post
Best for: Industry insights, trends, patterns you've noticed

```
[What you've observed]

[Specific evidence or examples]

[Why it matters]

[Your interpretation]

[Question to test if others see it too]
```

## Media Formats

Text-only posts aren't the only option. Different formats serve different purposes.

### Document/Carousel Posts
- Higher save rates and extended engagement
- Best for: step-by-step guides, frameworks, before/after
- Keep to 5-10 slides
- Each slide should stand alone
- End with a summary or CTA slide

### Image Posts
- Use when visual adds genuine value (charts, diagrams, photos from events)
- Avoid: stock photos, generic graphics, memes (unless that's your brand)
- Native uploads outperform links

### Polls
- Good for: genuine market research, sparking discussion
- Bad for: obvious questions, engagement farming
- Always follow up with your take on the results

### Video
- LinkedIn favors native video over links
- Keep under 90 seconds for most content
- Captions are essential (most watch muted)
- Face-to-camera builds personal connection

## Engagement Strategy

What happens after you post matters as much as what you post.

### The First Hour

LinkedIn's algorithm weighs early engagement heavily:
- Respond to every comment in the first 60 minutes
- Ask follow-up questions to extend conversations
- Thank people genuinely, not generically

### Comment Quality

Your comments on others' posts build your brand too:
- Add insight, not just agreement
- Share relevant experience
- Ask thoughtful follow-up questions
- Avoid "Great post!" without substance

### What Not to Do

- Engagement pods (LinkedIn detects and penalizes these)
- Asking people to "comment for a free resource"
- Posting and disappearing
- Commenting just to get visibility

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone Spectrum

Find your spot on each scale:

```
Corporate ←————————→ Casual
Reserved ←————————→ Vulnerable
Analytical ←————————→ Emotional
Serious ←————————→ Playful
```

Most Top Voices sit slightly right of center on each.

### Length
- Optimal: 150-300 words (enough for depth, short enough to finish)
- Maximum: 3,000 characters
- Use whitespace generously—dense text kills engagement

### Formatting Rules
- Never use hashtags inline with text
- Place 3-5 hashtags at the very end, after a line break
- One emoji max, if any (overuse signals inauthenticity)
- Use "I" not "we" for personal posts

## What to Avoid

**Content anti-patterns**:
- "I'm excited to announce..." (corporate speak)
- Humblebrags disguised as lessons
- Recycled viral post formats (the airport conversation, the Uber driver wisdom)
- Posting others' frameworks without credit
- Tragedy exploitation (using global events for engagement)

**Engagement anti-patterns**:
- "Comment YES if you agree"
- "Share this with 3 people"
- Tagging people who didn't ask to be tagged
- Posting controversial takes you don't actually believe
- Fake questions where you just want to share your answer

**Format anti-patterns**:
- Every. Sentence. As. Its. Own. Line.
- Excessive emoji strings
- ALL CAPS FOR EMPHASIS
- Hashtag stuffing

## Content Categories That Perform

1. **Career lessons** - Failures, pivots, decisions made
2. **Behind-the-scenes** - Real work experiences, how things actually work
3. **Industry insights** - Patterns you've noticed, trends you're seeing
4. **How-to frameworks** - Actionable processes readers can apply
5. **Contrarian takes** - Challenge assumptions (with substance)
6. **Personal milestones** - Only when tied to broader insights

## Quick Checklist Before Posting

1. **Hook**: Would this stop MY scroll?
2. **Focus**: Is there ONE clear idea?
3. **Value**: Would I find this useful if someone else posted it?
4. **Authenticity**: Does this sound like me, not "LinkedIn me"?
5. **Format**: Is it scannable with short paragraphs?
6. **Close**: Does it invite genuine engagement?
7. **Vulnerability check**: Am I sharing to help or to process?
8. **Cringe test**: Will I be proud of this post in a year?
