# /socialforge:manage-reviews — Review & Approval Manager

Manage the multi-tier approval workflow per brand's approval-chain.json.

## Approval Tiers
- **HERO content**: Internal review → Client approval → CEO approval (if configured)
- **HUB content**: Internal review → Client approval (optional)
- **HYGIENE content**: Internal review only (auto-approvable if configured)

## Actions
- `/socialforge:manage-reviews --approve P04` — Approve post P04 at current tier
- `/socialforge:manage-reviews --revise P04 "Make the background warmer"` — Request revision with feedback
- `/socialforge:manage-reviews --client-send` — Send all internally-approved posts to client review
- `/socialforge:manage-reviews --check` — Check pending approvals and send reminders

## State Transitions
QUEUED → ASSET_MATCHING → GENERATING → PENDING_REVIEW
  PENDING_REVIEW → APPROVED_INTERNAL | REVISION_REQUESTED | REJECTED
  REVISION_REQUESTED → GENERATING (re-enters production with feedback)
  REJECTED → QUEUED (start over)
  APPROVED_INTERNAL → PENDING_CLIENT (if client review required) | FINAL (if not)
  PENDING_CLIENT → APPROVED_CLIENT | REVISION_REQ_CLIENT | REJECTED_CLIENT
  APPROVED_CLIENT → PENDING_CEO (if CEO required) | FINAL (if not)
  PENDING_CEO → APPROVED_CEO → FINAL
  FINAL → (write-protected, no transitions)

## Rules
- FINAL status is write-protected — cannot be modified after finalization
- Revision requests re-enter the generation pipeline with specific feedback
- Max 3 revision cycles per HERO post before escalation
- Reminders sent via Slack/email after N days (per escalation_rules)
