# Writing X Posts

Create engaging X (Twitter) posts and threads that capture attention, drive engagement, and grow your audience.

## Core Principles

### Brevity is Power
X rewards concise, punchy content. Every word must earn its place. If you can say it in fewer words, do it.

### One Idea Per Tweet
Single tweets should contain one complete thought. Threads expand on ideas but each tweet should still stand alone.

### Hook or Die
You have ~1 second to stop the scroll. The first line determines everything—engagement, reach, and whether anyone reads the rest.

## Content Formats

### Single Post
- **Length**: Under 280 characters (under 200 is better)
- **Purpose**: One sharp insight, observation, or take
- **Best for**: Hot takes, quick tips, observations, quotes

### Thread
- **Length**: 5-10 tweets (7 is the sweet spot)
- **Purpose**: Deep dives, stories, frameworks, lists
- **Structure**: Each tweet stands alone but builds narrative
- **Best for**: Tutorials, stories, breakdowns, listicles

## Post Anatomy

### The Hook (Tweet 1)
The hook has one job: make someone stop scrolling.

**Hook formula**:
1. **Bold statement** - Surprise, shock, or make a claim
2. **Tension** - Highlight a struggle or pain point
3. **Twist** - Flip expectations
4. **Open loop** - Tease what's coming

See `references/hooks.md` for detailed hook patterns with examples.

### The Body (Tweets 2-6)
- Keep each tweet under 250 characters
- Use cliffhangers every 1-2 tweets
- Add visual breaks every 3-4 tweets
- White space and short sentences aid scanning

### The Close (Final tweets)
- **Punchy lesson**: Crystallize the main takeaway
- **Soft CTA**: Invite engagement naturally
- **Final CTA**: Direct ask (follow, repost, reply)

## Thread Frameworks

### Storytelling Framework
Best for: Personal experiences, case studies

```
1/ [Hook - outcome or surprising moment]
2/ [Set the scene - context]
3/ [The challenge/conflict]
4/ [The journey - what happened]
5/ [The turning point]
6/ [The lesson]
7/ [CTA - question or follow prompt]
```

### Listicle Framework
Best for: Tips, tools, resources

```
1/ [Hook - promise of value]
2/ [Item 1 - with brief explanation]
3/ [Item 2]
4/ [Item 3]
5/ [Item 4]
6/ [Item 5]
7/ [Summary + CTA]
```

### Problem-Solution Framework
Best for: Educational content, how-tos

```
1/ [Hook - the problem everyone faces]
2/ [Agitate - why it's painful]
3/ [Solution intro]
4/ [Step 1]
5/ [Step 2]
6/ [Step 3]
7/ [Results + CTA]
```

### Contrarian Framework
Best for: Thought leadership, hot takes

```
1/ [Bold contrarian statement]
2/ [What everyone believes]
3/ [Why they're wrong]
4/ [Your counter-argument]
5/ [Evidence/experience]
6/ [The nuanced truth]
7/ [Engagement question]
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone
- Conversational, not formal
- Confident, not arrogant
- Slightly provocative (when appropriate)
- Authentic, not performative

### Formatting
- Short sentences
- Generous white space
- Line breaks for emphasis
- 1-2 hashtags max (or none)
- Emojis sparingly (if brand allows)

### What to Avoid
- Corporate speak
- Excessive hashtags
- Links in main tweet (reduces reach)
- Asking for engagement without providing value
- Walls of text

## Engagement Mechanics

### Algorithm Signals
- Time-on-post (longer = better)
- Quick engagement in first hour
- Replies and quote tweets
- Saves and shares

### Best Posting Times
- Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am and 1-3pm EST
- Consistency matters more than perfect timing
- 2-3 quality threads per week beats daily mediocrity

## Quick Checklist

1. Does the hook stop the scroll?
2. Is each tweet under 250 characters?
3. Can each tweet stand alone?
4. Is there a clear payoff for reading?
5. Does it end with engagement opportunity?
6. Zero corporate speak?
