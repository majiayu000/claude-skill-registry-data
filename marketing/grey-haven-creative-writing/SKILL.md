# Creative Writing

Professional writing assistance across genres: blogs, research, fiction, essays, and marketing copy.

## Writing Philosophy

Great writing follows universal principles regardless of genre:

1. **Clarity** - Every sentence serves a purpose
2. **Voice** - Consistent tone appropriate to audience
3. **Structure** - Logical flow that guides readers
4. **Engagement** - Hooks, tension, and payoff
5. **Polish** - Refined through editing

## Genre Selection

Choose your writing type to load genre-specific guidance:

| Genre | Reference | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Blog posts | `references/blog-writing.md` | SEO content, thought leadership, tutorials |
| Research articles | `references/research-writing.md` | Academic papers, whitepapers, reports |
| Fiction | `references/fiction-writing.md` | Novels, short stories, creative narratives |
| Essays | `references/essay-writing.md` | Arguments, analysis, personal reflection |
| Marketing copy | `references/marketing-writing.md` | Landing pages, emails, ads |

## Universal Writing Process

### Phase 1: Understand

Before writing, clarify:

1. **Audience** - Who reads this? What do they know?
2. **Purpose** - Inform, persuade, entertain, or inspire?
3. **Constraints** - Word count, tone, format requirements?
4. **Success criteria** - What makes this piece successful?

### Phase 2: Structure

Create an outline before drafting:

```
1. Hook/Opening - Grab attention
2. Context - Set the stage
3. Main content - Deliver value
   - Point A with support
   - Point B with support
   - Point C with support
4. Conclusion - Synthesize and call to action
```

### Phase 3: Draft

Write freely without self-editing:

- **First draft is discovery** - Find what you're really saying
- **Momentum over perfection** - Keep moving forward
- **Mark uncertainties** - Use [TODO] or [CHECK] placeholders
- **Write the easy parts first** - Build confidence

### Phase 4: Revise

Systematic revision passes:

1. **Structure pass** - Does the logic flow?
2. **Clarity pass** - Is each sentence clear?
3. **Voice pass** - Is the tone consistent?
4. **Trim pass** - Cut unnecessary words
5. **Polish pass** - Refine word choices

### Phase 5: Finalize

| `templates/landing-page.md` | Marketing landing page |

## Writing Techniques

### Hook Patterns

**Question hook**: "Have you ever wondered why...?"

**Story hook**: "Last Tuesday, everything changed when..."
**Contrarian hook**: "Everything you know about X is wrong."
**Promise hook**: "By the end of this article, you'll be able to..."

### Transition Patterns

**Additive**: Furthermore, Additionally, Moreover
**Contrasting**: However, On the other hand, Nevertheless
**Causal**: Therefore, As a result, Consequently
**Sequential**: First, Next, Finally
**Exemplifying**: For example, Specifically, Consider

### Ending Patterns

**Summary**: Recap key points
**Call to action**: Direct next step
**Question**: Provoke continued thought
**Vision**: Paint future picture
**Circle back**: Return to opening

## Readability Guidelines

| Audience | Reading Level | Sentence Length |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| General public | 8th grade | 15-20 words |
| Professional | 10th grade | 20-25 words |
| Academic | 12th+ grade | 25-30 words |
| Technical | Varies | Match documentation style |

### Readability Techniques

- **Short paragraphs** - 3-4 sentences max
- **Active voice** - "The team built" not "It was built by"
- **Concrete nouns** - "hammer" not "implement"
- **Strong verbs** - "sprint" not "move quickly"
- **No jargon** - Unless audience expects it
