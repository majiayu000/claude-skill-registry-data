# SEO Content

This skill creates content that ranks on Google while actually being worth reading - not keyword-stuffed garbage that tricks algorithms but bores humans.

## Objective

Write content that satisfies search intent, demonstrates expertise, and earns rankings through genuine value - not manipulation.

## Intake Questions

Before writing SEO content, gather context:

1. **Target keyword**: What primary search term are you targeting?
2. **Search intent**: What does the searcher actually want? (Information, comparison, solution, purchase)
3. **Current top results**: What are the top 5 articles ranking? What do they cover?
4. **Audience knowledge level**: Beginner, intermediate, or expert?
5. **Unique angle**: What can you add that doesn't exist in current results?
6. **Internal links**: What related content exists to link to?
7. **CTA goal**: What should readers do after reading? (Subscribe, buy, read more)

## Search Intent Matching

Match content format to what searchers actually want:

### Informational Intent
**Signals**: "how to," "what is," "why does," "guide"
**Content type**: Tutorials, explanations, comprehensive guides
**Example**: "how to start a podcast" → Step-by-step guide

### Navigational Intent
**Signals**: Brand names, specific product searches
**Content type**: Product pages, brand pages, comparisons
**Example**: "Mailchimp pricing" → Pricing page or pricing comparison

### Commercial Investigation
**Signals**: "best," "vs," "review," "top," comparisons
**Content type**: Comparison posts, reviews, roundups
**Example**: "best email marketing software" → Comparison article

### Transactional Intent
**Signals**: "buy," "discount," "deal," specific product + purchase words
**Content type**: Product pages, sales pages
**Example**: "buy MacBook Pro" → Product/sales page

## Content Structure

### Title Tag Optimization
- Include primary keyword near the beginning
- Keep under 60 characters
- Add a hook or benefit
- Make it click-worthy (but not clickbait)

**Formula**: [Primary Keyword]: [Hook/Benefit] ([Year] if relevant)
**Example**: "Content Marketing Strategy: The Complete Guide for 2024"

### Meta Description
- 150-160 characters
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Summarize value proposition
- Include a subtle CTA

**Example**: "Learn how to build a content marketing strategy that drives traffic and leads. Step-by-step process with templates and real examples."

### H1-H6 Hierarchy
Structure content with semantic headings:

```
H1: Main Title (only one, contains primary keyword)
  H2: Major Section 1
    H3: Subsection
    H3: Subsection
  H2: Major Section 2
    H3: Subsection
      H4: Sub-subsection
  H2: Major Section 3
```

**Rules**:
- Only one H1 per page
- H2s are major sections (use keywords naturally)
- H3s break down H2 topics
- Don't skip levels (H2 → H4 is wrong)

### Introduction Formula
Hook readers and search engines in the first 100 words:

1. **Hook**: Surprising stat, question, or pain point
2. **Empathy**: Show you understand their situation
3. **Promise**: What they'll learn/gain
4. **Keyword**: Include primary keyword naturally
5. **Roadmap**: Brief preview of what's covered

### Body Content Guidelines

**Paragraph structure**:
- Lead with the point (inverted pyramid)
- One idea per paragraph
- 2-4 sentences max
- Use transition words between sections

**Readability targets**:
- 8th grade reading level (Hemingway app)
- Short sentences (under 20 words average)
- Active voice preferred
- Avoid jargon unless audience expects it
- **No Em-Dashes**: Never use em-dashes (-) or en-dashes (-). Use hyphens (-) or other punctuation.

**Semantic coverage**:
- Cover related topics/entities Google expects
- Answer "People Also Ask" questions
- Include synonyms and related terms naturally
- Don't keyword stuff - write for humans

### Conclusion Structure
End strong with:
1. Summary of key points
2. Reinforcement of main takeaway
3. Clear next step CTA
4. Internal link to related content

## E-E-A-T Signals

Demonstrate Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness:

### Experience
- Share personal experiences and case studies
- Include "I tested this" or "In my experience"
- Add original screenshots, data, or examples

### Expertise
- Author bio with credentials
- Cite sources and link to authoritative references
- Demonstrate deep knowledge of nuances

### Authoritativeness
- Link to authoritative external sources
- Get quoted/linked by other authorities
- Display credentials and certifications

### Trustworthiness
- Clear author attribution
- Updated dates on content
- Factual accuracy (cite sources)
- Transparent about limitations/bias

## Natural Writing Principles

Avoid these SEO writing mistakes by applying human content standards:

- **Say something disagreeable**: Don't just parrot consensus. Take a stand that a reasonable person could disagree with.
- **Human-Led Outlines**: Always start with a human-designed outline that prioritizes the narrative arc over keyword placement.
- **Inject "Un-AI" Statements**: Use humor, opinion, or unique perspectives that AI is unlikely to generate spontaneously.
- **Radical Specificity**: Back up every point with specific, real-world examples or data points.
- **Avoid Clichés**: If you find yourself using the same phrasing as every other article on the SERP, start over and find a different angle.

| Over-Optimized (Bad) | Natural (Good) |
|---------------------|----------------|
| "Best coffee makers. Looking for the best coffee makers? Our best coffee makers guide..." | "Finding the right coffee maker can be overwhelming. Here's how to choose..." |
| Keyword in every paragraph | Keyword where it naturally fits |
| Writing for algorithms | Writing for humans first |
| Thin, surface-level content | Comprehensive, genuinely helpful |
| Generic advice anyone could give | Specific insights from experience |

## Content Differentiation

Stand out from existing results by:

1. **Depth**: Cover aspects competitors missed
2. **Freshness**: Include latest information/trends
3. **Originality**: Add unique data, research, or perspectives
4. **Format**: Better visuals, structure, or interactivity
5. **Authority**: Stronger credentials or real experience
6. **Actionability**: More specific, implementable advice

## Output Format

When creating SEO content, deliver:

1. **SEO Brief**: Keyword, intent, competitor analysis, angle
2. **Title Tag & Meta Description**: Optimized versions
3. **Content Outline**: H2/H3 structure with key points
4. **Full Article**: Complete content following guidelines
5. **On-Page Checklist**: Completed checklist for QA
6. **Internal Link Suggestions**: Related content to link

## Cross-References

- Apply `brand-voice` to maintain brand consistency

- SEO articles can become sources for `content-atomizer`
- Include `lead-magnet` CTAs where relevant
- `newsletter` can repurpose SEO content for subscribers
