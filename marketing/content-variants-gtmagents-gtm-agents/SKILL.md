# Content Variant System Skill

## When to Use
- Mapping creative requirements for each decision tree branch.
- Coordinating design, copy, and legal reviews across multiple channels.
- Auditing variant performance or sunsetting outdated experiences.

## Framework
1. **Variant Inventory** – catalog base asset, variant name, audience, channel, owner, expiration.
2. **Approval Flow** – document reviewers, compliance steps, localization, accessibility requirements.
3. **Asset Delivery** – link storage locations (DAM, CMS, MAP) plus version IDs and CDN paths.
4. **Testing Hooks** – note experiment IDs, KPIs, guardrails for each variant.
5. **Lifecycle Management** – set refresh cadences, archival rules, and dependency tracking.

## Templates
- Variant matrix (channel × persona × lifecycle stage).
- Approval checklist (copy, design, legal, localization, accessibility).
- Performance tracker (variant → impressions → engagement → conversion → decision).

## Tips
- Assign unique IDs to every variant for analytics + rollback references.
- Bundle variants into kits aligned with key journeys for easier governance.
- Pair with `decision-trees` outputs to ensure every branch has an approved asset.
