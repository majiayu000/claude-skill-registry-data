## What it does

This prompt instructs the AI to act as a senior content strategist and market researcher, gathering and organizing comprehensive business and industry inputs—covering industry overview, marketing objectives and KPIs, competitor insights, channel performance, brand voice, available assets, current content challenges, and timeline/budget—so a content team or agency can be briefed effectively.

## Inputs


### textInputs

Pass each text input using `--input <key>=<value>` flags.

| Variable key | Required? | Description | Defaults |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `Industry` | Optional |  | `Comestic` |
| `Language` | Optional |  | `Vietnamese` |



### Models and options

This skill's modality is: **`text`**.

To discover which `model` values you can use (and which `options` keys/values are valid for each model), run:

```bash
betterprompt resources --models-only --json
```

Then filter the returned JSON array to entries where `modality` is `"text"`.

## How to run

### Step 1: Collect inputs

First, run `betterprompt resources --models-only --json` and filter to `modality: "text"` to discover valid models and available options:

```bash
betterprompt resources --models-only --json
```

Use only the models and option values that appear in the filtered results.

Then collect all inputs from the human:

- Optional text inputs (use defaults if not provided by the human):
    - `Industry` (default: `Comestic`)
  - `Language` (default: `Vietnamese`)
- Optional: model and options.
  - Present the human with the default model **`gpt-5`** and its available options. Look up `gpt-5` in the `betterprompt resources` output (filtered to modality `"text"`) and show its `availableOptions` as: `key: val1, val2 (default), val3  |  key2: ...`. Mark a value `(default)` if it matches these defaults: `{}`.
  - If the human does not specify, defaults are used: model `gpt-5`, options `{}`. Other models from the resources call are also available.


### Step 2: Run via BetterPrompt CLI

Use the frontmatter's `name` as the positional argument (for this skill, use `industry-research`).

Command form:

```bash
betterprompt generate industry-research \
  [--input <key>=<value>] \
  [--model <model>] \
  [--options <options JSON>] \
  [--json]
```

Notes:

- Pass each text input as a separate `--input <key>=<value>` flag.
- If the human does **not** mention a model, **omit** `--model` and BetterPrompt will use the default model: **`gpt-5`**.
- If the human does **not** mention options, **omit** `--options` and BetterPrompt will use the default options: **`{}`**.
- If the run times out, the response will include a `runId` you can use to fetch the result later.

Example (using defaults shown above):

```bash
betterprompt generate industry-research \
  --input Industry=Comestic \
  --input Language=Vietnamese \
  --model gpt-5 \
  --options '{}'
```
