# Book Back Matter Generator

Generate complete marketing and launch materials for fiction ebooks in a single consolidated markdown file.

## What This Generates

Creates 7 categories of promotional content:
1. **Emails** - Announcement, follow-up, ARC invites, welcome sequences
2. **Ads & Banners** - Headlines, body copy, ad variations
3. **Retail Copy** - Blurbs, metadata guides, copyright pages
4. **Social Media** - Captions, banner text, size guides
5. **Press Kit** - Media kit, author bio, ARC review sheets
6. **BookClicker Swaps** - Newsletter swap letters
7. **Lead Magnet** - Story outline and CTA emails

## Required Information

Before generating, collect:
- **Book title** and **author name**
- **Genre/subgenre** (e.g., contemporary romance, romantic suspense)
- **Core tropes** (e.g., enemies-to-lovers, CEO, workplace)
- **Heat level** and content warnings
- **Story hook** (1-2 sentence pitch)
- **Key themes/elements** (e.g., corporate intrigue, power dynamics)
- **Series information** (standalone or series position)
- **Brand colors** (optional: background, accent colors)
- **Preferred fonts** (optional)
- **Launch timeline** (ARC dates, release date)

## Generation Process

1. **Gather Information**: Ask for missing details if not provided
2. **Adapt Voice**: Match the book's tone (dark/light, serious/playful)
3. **Generate Content**: Create all 7 sections with appropriate subsections
4. **Format Output**: Single markdown file with ## headers for categories and ### for subsections

For a complete example showing structure, voice, and content depth, see `references/example-output.md`.

## Writing Guidelines

**Voice & Tone**:
- Match the book's atmosphere (dark/light, intense/playful)
- Keep copy punchy and benefit-focused
- Use active voice and present tense where possible

**Email Copy**:
- Subject lines: 6-10 words, intrigue-driven
- Preheaders: Complete the subject line's promise
- Body: Hook → Value → CTA (under 100 words)
- Always personalize with [First Name] placeholder

**Ad Copy**:
- Headlines: Sharp, benefit-driven, under 150 characters
- Bodies: Include hook, genre signals, emotional payoff promise
- Test different angles: emotional, transactional, aspirational

**Retail Blurbs**:
- Open with conflict/tension
- "Expect:" bullet format for quick scanning
- Close with reader positioning ("For readers who...")

**Social Media**:
- Mix lengths: some ultra-short, some descriptive
- Always include [Link] placeholder
- Vary emotional tone across captions

**Metadata**:
- Focus on U.S. major retailers (Amazon, Apple Books, Kobo)
- Balance popular keywords with specific tropes
- Front-load important content warnings

## Common Patterns

**CEO/Billionaire Romance**:
- Emphasize power dynamics, boardroom to bedroom
- Keywords: ruthless, empire, negotiate, acquire
- Highlight professional stakes vs. personal vulnerability

**Enemies-to-Lovers**:
- Focus on tension, banter, forbidden aspects
- Keywords: rival, hate-to-love, forced proximity
- Play up the "line they shouldn't cross"

**Dark Romance**:
- Content warnings up front
- Emphasize edge, danger, moral complexity
- Use atmospheric language: shadows, risk, obsession

**Contemporary Romance**:
- Focus on relatability and emotional journey
- Balance steam level with character depth
- Highlight specific modern settings

## Customization Notes

- Replace [First Name], [Date], [Link], [Author email] with actual values before use
- Adjust heat level language based on genre conventions
- Modify color schemes in comments to match brand
- Scale lead magnet word count based on author's capacity
