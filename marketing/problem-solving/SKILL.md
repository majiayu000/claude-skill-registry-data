# Marketing Problem-Solving

Systematic techniques for solving complex marketing challenges, breaking through creative blocks, and optimizing campaigns.

## Language & Quality Standards

**CRITICAL**: Respond in the same language the user is using. If Vietnamese, respond in Vietnamese. If Spanish, respond in Spanish.

**Standards**: Token efficiency, sacrifice grammar for concision, list unresolved questions at end.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply problem-solving techniques when facing:
- **Campaign Complexity Spirals** - Campaign keeps adding features/channels, becoming unwieldy
- **Creative Innovation Blocks** - Stuck in conventional approaches, need breakthrough ideas
- **Recurring Campaign Patterns** - Same issues appearing across multiple campaigns
- **Assumption Constraints** - Limited by industry "truths" or conventional wisdom
- **Audience Scale Uncertainty** - Unclear how strategy scales from niche to mass market
- **General Stuckness** - Progress halted, unclear how to move forward

## Core Techniques

### 1. Simplification Cascades
**Problem:** Campaign complexity spiraling out of control

**When to use:**
- Campaign has too many channels, messages, or touchpoints
- Team overwhelmed by execution complexity
- Budget spread too thin across tactics
- Message diluted across too many variations

**How it works:**
1. List all campaign elements (channels, messages, segments, assets)
2. Identify the 20% that drives 80% of results
3. Ruthlessly cut the rest
4. Reassess and repeat if still complex

**Marketing example:**
```
Problem: Product launch campaign across 8 channels, 15 assets, 4 segments
↓ Simplification Round 1
Focus: Top 3 channels (email, LinkedIn, blog), 6 core assets, 2 key segments
↓ Simplification Round 2
Core: Email + LinkedIn, 3 assets (landing page, case study, email sequence), 1 primary segment
Result: Focused execution, better results, manageable workload
```

### 2. Collision-Zone Thinking
**Problem:** Creative blocks, conventional approaches not working

**When to use:**
- Campaign ideas feel generic or uninspired
- Competitor campaigns all look similar
- Need differentiation and breakthrough positioning
- Stuck in industry best practices that don't work

**How it works:**
1. Identify two unrelated domains/industries
2. Force collision: "What if [industry A] met [industry B]?"
3. Extract unexpected insights
4. Apply to your marketing challenge

**Marketing example:**
```
Challenge: B2B SaaS email campaign feels boring
Collision: "What if enterprise software marketing met sneaker drops?"
Insights: Scarcity, hype, exclusive access, community building
Application: Limited beta access campaign, waitlist with perks, exclusive Slack community
Result: 3x higher engagement, viral social sharing
```

**See:** `./references/collision-zone-thinking.md`

### 3. Meta-Pattern Recognition
**Problem:** Same issues recurring across campaigns

**When to use:**
- Different campaigns failing in similar ways
- Repeated performance issues across channels
- Team making same mistakes
- Need to identify root cause vs symptoms

**How it works:**
1. Document 3+ instances of similar failures
2. Look for deeper pattern beneath surface issues
3. Address root cause, not symptoms
4. Create system to prevent recurrence

**Marketing example:**
```
Surface problems:
- Email campaign: Low open rates
- Social campaign: Low engagement
- Content campaign: Low traffic

Meta-pattern discovered: Weak audience understanding
Root cause: No buyer persona research or validation
Solution: Comprehensive persona development process
Prevention: Mandatory persona validation before any campaign
```

**See:** `./references/meta-pattern-recognition.md`

### 4. Inversion Exercise
**Problem:** Constrained by industry assumptions or "best practices"

**When to use:**
- Conventional approaches failing
- Industry "rules" limiting creativity
- Need to challenge assumptions
- Market leader doing opposite of conventional wisdom

**How it works:**
1. State current assumption: "We must do X"
2. Invert it: "What if we did the opposite of X?"
3. Explore inverted scenario seriously
4. Identify valid insights from inversion

**Marketing example:**
```
Assumption: "We must build email list before launching"
Inversion: "What if we launched with zero email list?"
Exploration: Focus on virality, referrals, paid acquisition, partnerships
Insight: Email list might be vanity metric; focus on product-led growth
Result: Skip content marketing, invest in product experience and referral program
```

**See:** `./references/inversion-exercise.md`

### 5. Scale Game
**Problem:** Uncertain how strategy scales across audience sizes

**When to use:**
- Unclear if niche strategy works at scale
- Planning market expansion
- Pivot from early adopters to mainstream
- Budget allocation across segments uncertain

**How it works:**
1. Test strategy at 10x smaller scale
2. Test strategy at 10x larger scale
3. Identify what breaks at each scale
4. Design for actual scale, not current size

**Marketing example:**
```
Current: 100 customers via founder-led sales

10x smaller (10 customers):
- Works: Personal outreach, custom demos, high-touch
- Breaks: Can't justify any paid marketing

10x larger (1,000 customers):
- Works: Content marketing, paid ads, self-service onboarding
- Breaks: Founder-led sales, custom demos

10x larger again (10,000 customers):
- Works: Product-led growth, brand awareness, partnerships
- Breaks: Content marketing bandwidth, ad costs unsustainable

Insight: At 100→1,000, invest in content + paid ads + self-service
Don't optimize for 10 or 10,000; build for 1,000
```

**See:** `./references/scale-game.md`

### 6. When Stuck Protocol
**Problem:** Progress completely halted, don't know next step

**When to use:**
- Campaign stalled with no clear path forward
- Team disagrees on approach
- Overwhelmed by options or complexity
- Decision paralysis

**How it works:**
1. **Zoom out:** What's the actual goal? (Often forgot amid tactics)
2. **Constraint:** What if you had 1 day and $100? (Forces prioritization)
3. **Naïve question:** What would a beginner do? (Often surprisingly insightful)
4. **Ship smallest:** What's the absolute minimum to test hypothesis?

**Marketing example:**
```
Stuck: Launching new product, paralyzed by marketing plan complexity

Zoom out: Goal = validate market demand + get 10 paying customers

Constraint: 1 day + $100 budget
- Can't build full funnel
- Can't create 50 assets
- Focus: Simple landing page + $100 LinkedIn ads

Naïve approach: "Just tell people about it"
- Direct outreach to 50 ideal customers
- Simple email explaining value

Ship smallest: Landing page + email to 50 prospects + $100 ads
Result: 3 sales in week 1, validated demand, iterate from there
```

## Problem-Solving Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Problem Type
- Complexity spiral? → Simplification Cascades
- Creative block? → Collision-Zone Thinking
- Recurring pattern? → Meta-Pattern Recognition
- Assumption constraint? → Inversion Exercise
- Scale uncertainty? → Scale Game
- Completely stuck? → When Stuck Protocol

### Step 2: Apply Technique
- Follow structured process for chosen technique
- Document insights and findings
- Validate assumptions with data/research

### Step 3: Implement Solution
- Create action plan from insights
- Test solution at small scale first
- Measure results and iterate

### Step 4: Capture Learning
- Document problem + solution for future reference
- Share with team to build knowledge base
- Update campaign playbooks with insights

## Integration with Marketing Workflow

Use problem-solving techniques at these key moments:

**Planning Phase:**
- Scale Game: Validate strategy for target audience size
- Inversion Exercise: Challenge conventional approaches

**Execution Phase:**
- Simplification Cascades: Cut scope when overwhelmed
- When Stuck Protocol: Unblock campaign development

**Optimization Phase:**
- Meta-Pattern Recognition: Identify recurring issues
- Collision-Zone Thinking: Generate breakthrough ideas

**Review Phase:**
- Document learnings for future campaigns
- Update problem-solving playbook

## Quick Reference

**Complexity overwhelm?** → Simplification Cascades (cut to 20% that matters)
**Creative stuck?** → Collision-Zone Thinking (force unexpected combinations)
**Same problems repeating?** → Meta-Pattern Recognition (find root cause)
**Best practices failing?** → Inversion Exercise (try opposite approach)
**Scaling unclear?** → Scale Game (test at 10x/0.1x scale)
**Completely blocked?** → When Stuck Protocol (zoom out, constrain, ship smallest)
