# Publish Content — ContentForge CMS Publishing

Push publication-ready content from the ContentForge pipeline directly to your CMS (Webflow or WordPress) via MCP connectors. Preview before publishing, verify post-publish, and fall back to HTML export when no connector is available.

## When to Use

Use `/contentforge:cf-publish` when:
- You have a **finished, reviewed content piece** (Phase 8 complete, score >=7.0)
- You want to **publish directly** to Webflow or WordPress without copy-pasting
- You need to **schedule content** for a future publish date
- You want **post-publish verification** (URL live, meta tags correct, images loaded)
- You want an **HTML export** for manual upload when no CMS connector is configured

**Do NOT use for:**
- Content still in pipeline (must be Phase 8 complete)
- Content that did not reach APPROVED (anything below 7.0 — a 5.0-6.9 piece is `review_required`, not publishable)
- Platforms other than Webflow/WordPress (use `/contentforge:cf-social-adapt` for social media)

## What This Command Does

1. **Verify Connector** -- Check if Webflow or WordPress MCP connector is active
2. **Load Content** -- Pull finished content from Google Drive or local output
3. **Format for Platform** -- Convert markdown/docx to platform-specific HTML/blocks
4. **Preview** -- Show rendered preview with meta tags, slug, featured image
5. **AI Disclosure & Provenance** -- EU AI Act Article 50 check (applicable from 2 Aug 2026)
6. **Publish/Schedule** -- Push to CMS as draft, published, or scheduled
7. **Post-Publish Verification** -- Confirm URL is live, meta tags are correct, content renders properly
8. **Fallback** -- If no connector, generate standalone HTML file for manual upload

## Required Inputs

**Minimum Required:**
- **Content Source** -- Google Drive URL, local file path, or requirement ID (e.g., `REQ-001`)
- **Platform** -- `webflow` or `wordpress`
- **Status** -- `draft`, `publish`, or `schedule`

**Optional:**
- **Schedule Date** -- ISO date/time for scheduled publishing (required if status=schedule)
- **Collection/Category** -- Webflow collection slug or WordPress category
- **Featured Image** -- URL or local path to hero image
- **Author** -- Override the byline author (default: the author applied in Phase 3 from the brand's `author_profiles`; falls back to authorless if none configured)
- **Tags** -- Comma-separated list of tags
- **Slug Override** -- Custom URL slug (defaults to SEO-optimized slug from Phase 6)

## How to Use

### Interactive Mode
```
/contentforge:cf-publish
```
**Prompts you for:**
1. Content source (Drive URL, file path, or requirement ID)
2. Platform (Webflow / WordPress)
3. Publish status (draft / publish / schedule)
4. Preview confirmation before pushing

### Quick Mode
```
/contentforge:cf-publish REQ-001 --platform=webflow --status=publish
```

### Schedule for Later
```
/contentforge:cf-publish REQ-001 --platform=wordpress --status=schedule --date="2026-09-01T09:00:00"
```

### Publish from Google Drive
```
/contentforge:cf-publish https://drive.google.com/file/d/ABC123 --platform=webflow --status=draft
```

## What Happens

### Step 1: Connector Verification (5-10 seconds)

Before attempting any CMS operation, verify the target connector is available.

**Check MCP connector status:**
```
Platform: webflow
Connector: Webflow MCP (https://mcp.webflow.com/sse)
Status: CHECKING...
```

**Case A: Connector Active**
```
Webflow MCP: CONNECTED
Site: acme-corp.webflow.io
Collections available: blog-posts, case-studies, resources
Proceeding with direct publish...
```

**Case B: Connector Not Found**
```
Webflow MCP: NOT CONNECTED

No Webflow connector detected in .mcp.json.
Falling back to HTML export mode.

To enable direct publishing, add the Webflow connector:
  /contentforge:cf-connect webflow

Generating standalone HTML file for manual upload...
```

### Step 2: Load and Validate Content (10-15 seconds)

**Load content from source:**
- Read .docx or markdown from Google Drive or local output directory
- Extract metadata: title, meta description, slug, keywords, author, featured image
- Validate quality score >= 7.0 (refuse to publish unreviewed content)

**Validation checks:**
```
Content Validation
---------------------------------------------------
Title: "AI in Healthcare: 2026 Trends"        OK
Quality Score: 9.2/10                          OK
Status: Approved (Phase 8 Complete)            OK
Word Count: 1,947                              OK
Meta Title: 58 chars                           OK
Meta Description: 152 chars                    OK
SEO Slug: ai-in-healthcare-2026-trends         OK
Featured Image: hero-ai-healthcare.jpg         OK
---------------------------------------------------
All checks passed. Ready to format for Webflow.
```

**Rejection cases:**
- Quality score < 7.0: "Content has not passed quality review. Score: 4.8/10. Run the full pipeline first."
- No Phase 8 completion: "Content pipeline incomplete. Phase 8 (Output Manager) has not run."
- Missing meta tags: "Meta title and description are required. Run Phase 6 (SEO Optimizer) first."

### Step 3: Format for Target Platform (10-20 seconds)

Convert ContentForge output into platform-native format.

**Webflow Formatting:**
- Convert markdown headings to Webflow rich text blocks
- Map H1 to `name` field, body to `post-body` rich text field
- Set `slug`, `meta-title`, `meta-description` fields
- Upload featured image to Webflow assets, link to `main-image` field
- Map tags to Webflow multi-reference field
- Preserve inline links, bold, italic, lists, blockquotes

**WordPress Formatting:**
- Convert markdown to WordPress Gutenberg blocks (paragraph, heading, list, quote, image)
- Set `title`, `content`, `excerpt`, `slug`, `meta` fields
- Upload featured image via media endpoint, set as `featured_media`
- Map categories and tags to taxonomy terms
- Preserve shortcodes if present in original content
- Add Yoast/RankMath SEO meta if plugin detected

**Shared formatting rules:**
- Strip .docx formatting artifacts (extra whitespace, page breaks)
- Ensure all internal links use relative paths where possible
- Validate all image URLs are accessible (no broken images)
- Preserve citation formatting (footnotes or inline links based on platform preference)

### Step 4: Preview Before Publish

Show the user exactly what will be published before pushing.

```
PUBLISH PREVIEW
===================================================

Platform: Webflow (acme-corp.webflow.io)
Collection: blog-posts
Status: PUBLISH (goes live immediately)

---------------------------------------------------
URL: https://acme-corp.webflow.io/blog/ai-in-healthcare-2026-trends

Meta Title: AI in Healthcare: 2026 Trends and Predictions
Meta Description: Explore how AI is transforming healthcare in 2026,
  from diagnostic tools to patient care. Data-driven analysis with
  14 verified sources.

Featured Image: hero-ai-healthcare.jpg (1200x630, 245KB)
Author: Jane Doe, Head of Content (from brand author_profiles; 'ContentForge' only if the brand is deliberately authorless)
Tags: AI, Healthcare, Technology Trends, 2026
Word Count: 1,947
---------------------------------------------------

Content Preview (first 300 characters):
"Multi-agent AI systems are changing how healthcare organizations
approach diagnostics, patient care, and operational efficiency. The
approach? Deploy specialized AI agents -- one for imaging analysis,
another for patient history, a third for treatment recommendations..."

===================================================

Proceed with publish? (yes / no / edit)
```

**User options:**
- `yes` -- Push to CMS
- `no` -- Cancel, return to command line
- `edit` -- Open content for last-minute edits before publish

### Step 4.5: AI Disclosure & Provenance (EU AI Act Article 50 — applicable from 2 Aug 2026)

Before pushing, check whether AI-generation disclosure applies:

**Does it apply?** Yes if the brand targets EU audiences (check the brand profile's markets/regions or ask the user once and record the answer), OR if the brand profile's guardrails require AI-content disclosure regardless of region.

**If it applies:**

1. **For .docx deliverables** — note that C2PA content provenance signing is available via `--c2pa-sign` (with `--c2pa-signing-cert` and `--c2pa-signing-key`) on `scripts/generate-docx.py` (see `docs/c2pa-production-cert.md` for certificate setup). If the piece was produced without signing and the user needs it, offer to regenerate the .docx with signing enabled.
2. **For CMS publishes (Webflow/WordPress)** — offer to add a disclosure label to the article, e.g.:
   > "This article was produced with AI assistance and reviewed by [brand]'s editorial team."
   **Place it at the top — in the byline area or directly under the title — never only in the footer.** The European Commission's labelling rule is that the label must be "clearly perceivable and distinguishable at the latest at the time of first exposure" of a reader to the text, and must stay visible when the content is reshared or downloaded (so it belongs in the article body the CMS syndicates, not a site-template footer). Record the user's choice in the tracking notes.
   **Which EU icon (optional to use; the label itself is not):** the Commission publishes three — **Basic** (AI was involved), **Fully AI-Generated** (no human-created elements or human editorial control), **Partially AI-Modified** (pre-existing human-made content partially modified with AI). Choose from this run's records: a `phase-6.5-authorship.json` with `may_claim_authored: true` → **Partially AI-Modified**; no source draft and no editorial review → **Fully AI-Generated**; anything unclear → **Basic**. Uncertainty never skips the label. Source: [EU icons for labelling AI-generated content](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-icons-labelling-ai-generated-content) (updated 24 Sep 2026).
3. **For downstream social promotion** — remind the user that major platforms (LinkedIn, Meta, TikTok, YouTube) have AI-content labeling options/requirements; `/contentforge:cf-social-adapt` surfaces these per platform.

**If it does not apply** (no EU targeting, no guardrail requirement): skip with a one-line note in the output — "AI-disclosure check: not required (no EU targeting configured)" — so the decision is auditable.

### Step 5: Publish / Schedule / Draft (5-15 seconds)

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Webflow
- Uses Collection Items API for blog posts
- Rich text field supports HTML content directly
- Images must be uploaded to Webflow Assets first, then referenced
- Publish requires site publish after item creation (API call to publish site)
- CMS items are draft by default; explicit publish step needed
- Rate limit: 60 requests per minute

### WordPress
- Uses REST API v2 (`/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`)
- Gutenberg blocks preferred over classic editor HTML
- Featured image uploaded via `/wp-json/wp/v2/media`, then linked by ID
- Categories and tags are taxonomy term IDs (lookup by name first)
- Supports `date` field for scheduling
- Application Passwords or OAuth for authentication
- Rate limit: Varies by host (typically 100-500 requests/minute)

## Requirements

### MCP Integrations (Optional but Recommended)
- **Webflow MCP** (`https://mcp.webflow.com/sse`) -- For direct Webflow publishing
- **WordPress** -- Via REST API (no MCP endpoint; uses HTTP connector or direct API)

### Environment
- Claude Code or Cowork (latest version)
- Content must have completed Phase 8 (Output Manager)
- Quality score >= 7.0
