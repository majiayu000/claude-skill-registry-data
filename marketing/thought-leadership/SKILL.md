# Thought Leadership Content Creator

Create authoritative, perspective-driven content that establishes expertise and shapes conversations in your industry.

## Before Writing

1. **Read context profiles**:
   - `/context/voice-dna.json` - Maintain authentic voice
   - `/context/icp.json` - Understand audience sophistication
   - `/context/business-profile.json` - Align with positioning

2. **Check knowledge base** for supporting content in `/knowledge/`

## What is Thought Leadership?

Thought leadership is NOT:
- Generic how-to content
- Regurgitated industry advice
- Safe, consensus opinions
- Purely promotional content

Thought leadership IS:
- Original perspectives on industry topics
- Experience-backed insights
- Contrarian (but substantiated) takes
- Forward-looking predictions
- Framework creation
- Problem articulation that others haven't voiced
