# Asset Approval Workflow Skill

## When to Use
- Coordinating creative reviews across multiple partner stakeholders.
- Auditing compliance for regulated industries.
- Preventing go-live delays caused by unclear feedback loops.

## Framework
1. **Review Matrix** – define reviewers per asset type (brand, legal, product, regional) and required evidence.
2. **SLA Cadence** – set response times, reminder schedule, and escalation triggers.
3. **Feedback Channels** – standardize annotation tools, version naming, and acceptance criteria.
4. **Sign-off Logging** – capture final approvals with timestamps, approver names, and file hashes.
5. **Change Control** – document post-approval edits, expiration dates, and refresh plans.

## Templates
- Approval tracker (asset → reviewer → status → notes → evidence link).
- SLA chart outlining response times by priority level.
- Change request form for post-approval edits.

## Tips
- Use shared storage with permissions per partner to prevent accidental edits.
- Pair with `co-branding` skill to auto-check brand compliance before review.
- Automate reminders via project tools to keep cross-company teams on schedule.
