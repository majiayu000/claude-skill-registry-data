# Brand Guidelines

Apply consistent brand voice, tone, and style across all written content while adapting appropriately for each platform.

## Before Writing

**Always read the brand profile first**: Check `assets/brand-profile.md` for the specific brand's voice, tone, messaging pillars, and style rules. If no brand profile exists, ask the user to provide brand guidelines or help them create one using the template.

## Core Framework

### 1. Voice (WHO the brand is)
Voice is the brand's personality—consistent across all content.

**Voice dimensions to consider**:
- **Formal ↔ Casual**: How structured is the language?
- **Serious ↔ Playful**: Is humor appropriate?
- **Technical ↔ Accessible**: What's the expertise level?
- **Reserved ↔ Enthusiastic**: How much energy?
- **Traditional ↔ Innovative**: How cutting-edge?

### 2. Tone (HOW the brand speaks in context)
Tone adapts to situation while staying true to voice.

**Tone shifts by context**:
- Celebrating wins → More enthusiastic
- Addressing problems → More empathetic
- Teaching → More patient and clear
- Thought leadership → More authoritative
- Community building → More warm and inclusive

### 3. Messaging Pillars (WHAT the brand talks about)
Core themes that anchor all content:
- Primary topics and expertise areas
- Values and beliefs to reinforce
- Stories and proof points to reference
- Phrases and language to use/avoid

### 4. Style Rules (Mechanics)
Consistent formatting and language choices:
- Capitalization conventions
- Punctuation preferences
- Terminology and word choices
- Formatting patterns

## Applying Guidelines to Content

### Step 1: Identify Context
- What platform is this for?
- What's the content goal? (educate, inspire, convert, engage)
- Who's the specific audience?
- What's the emotional context?

### Step 2: Adapt for Platform
See `references/platforms.md` for platform-specific guidance on:
- LinkedIn (professional thought leadership)
- Substack (long-form newsletter)
- X/Twitter (concise, conversational)

### Step 3: Write with Voice
Apply brand voice dimensions:
- Use vocabulary consistent with formality level
- Match energy and enthusiasm level
- Maintain expertise positioning
- Reflect brand personality

### Step 4: Check Messaging Alignment
Ensure content:
- Supports at least one messaging pillar
- Uses approved terminology
- Avoids prohibited language
- Reinforces brand values

### Step 5: Apply Style Rules
- Follow capitalization conventions
- Use correct punctuation style
- Apply formatting patterns
- Check terminology consistency
