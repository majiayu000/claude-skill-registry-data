# NestMind Marketing Skill

## Core Positioning

### The Two Problems NestMind Solves

**Problem 1: Scattered Knowledge**
YouTube videos you meant to watch again. Bookmarks buried in folders you forgot existed. Notes scattered across apps. Your knowledge lives in a dozen different places, and none of them talk to each other.

**Problem 2: Privacy Exploitation**
The apps that promise to organize your life have a hidden cost: you become the product. They track what you save, analyze what you search, and profile what you read. They use it to train AI models and target ads.

### The NestMind Promise
> "One home for everything you save. Find it by meaning, not memory. Keep it truly private."

## The NestMind Value Proposition

### Primary Hook (Lead With This)
> "Stop app-hopping. Your bookmarks, videos, and todos belong in one place."

NestMind unifies scattered knowledge — bookmarks, YouTube videos, todos — into a single searchable library with AI that understands meaning, not just keywords. All processing happens on-device. No tracking. No data collection. Ever.

### The Core Insight
People don't need another app that stores things. They need ONE app that replaces four. Safari bookmarks + YouTube saves + Notes + Reminders = fragmented mess. NestMind = unified, searchable, private.

### Messaging Hierarchy

1. **Hero Message**: One home for everything (unification/consolidation)
2. **Supporting**: Find by meaning, not keywords (semantic search + NestAI)
3. **Supporting**: Truly private — on-device AI, no tracking (privacy)
4. **Supporting**: Tasks connected to knowledge (Smart Todos)

## Positioning Framework

### The Transformation
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Bookmarks in Safari, videos in YouTube, notes in Notes | Everything in one searchable place |
| "I saved this somewhere..." + 20 min searching | Describe what you want, find it instantly |
| Apps mining your data to train AI and target ads | On-device processing, truly deletable |

### Competitive Differentiation

| Competitor | Their Focus | NestMind's Edge |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Safari Reading List | Browser-only bookmarks | Videos + todos + AI search + privacy |
| Pocket (discontinued) | Read later | Still alive + AI search + on-device |
| Raindrop | Powerful organization | AI search by meaning + privacy |
| Notion | Everything workspace | Simpler, mobile-first, private |
| Apple Notes | General notes | Knowledge-focused, semantic search |

### Target Personas

1. **Knowledge Worker** — Saves research, tutorials, industry articles. Tired of app-hopping between Safari, YouTube, Notes.
2. **Lifelong Learner** — Saves educational content, YouTube tutorials. Wants to actually find and use what they save.
3. **Privacy-Conscious User** — Distrusts Pocket/Notion/Evernote data practices. Wants on-device processing.

## Homepage Structure

### Above the Fold (Critical)

**Headline**: Focus on unification and the end to app-hopping
- ✅ "Your bookmarks, videos, and todos. Finally in one place."
- ✅ "Stop app-hopping. Start finding."
- ✅ "One home for everything you save."
- ❌ "Save everything. Find anything." (too generic — could be any app)

**Subheadline**: The "how" + privacy in one sentence
- "NestMind brings your scattered knowledge together. Find anything by meaning — not keywords. All AI runs on your device. Private by design."

**Visual**: Phone mockup showing unified library (bookmarks + videos + todos visible)

**CTA**: Single, clear action
- "Download Free" with iOS badge (post-launch)
- "Try Free for 14 Days" (if emphasizing trial)

### Section Order (Recommended)

1. **Hero**: Unification hook + CTA
2. **Problem**: "Sound familiar?" — scattered knowledge, can't find anything
3. **Solution**: One home + AI search + privacy (3-column layout)
4. **Features**: Deeper dive on Bookmarks, Videos, Todos, NestAI
5. **Privacy**: The "other apps spy on you" message
6. **Social Proof**: Testimonials, numbers (when available)
7. **Pricing**: Transparent pricing section
8. **Final CTA**: Repeat the primary action

### What to Improve on Current Site

1. **Move the Vision page copy to the homepage** — "scattered knowledge" message is powerful but buried
2. **Add pricing section** — transparency builds trust
3. **Show the unified experience** — one screenshot showing bookmarks, videos, todos together
4. **Emphasize NestAI** — "ask questions about your saved content" is a differentiator
5. **Add social proof** — even TestFlight testimonials help

## Copywriting Principles

### Voice & Tone

- **Confident but not arrogant**: "We built this because we needed it"
- **Clear, not clever**: Explain benefits in plain language
- **Warm, not corporate**: Write like a person, not a company

### Power Words for NestMind

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| Listen, hear, audio | Revolutionary, cutting-edge |
| Private, yours, on-device | Best-in-class, world-class |
| Find, discover, surface | Leverage, synergize |
| Simple, fast, instant | Seamless, frictionless |

### Copy Length Guidelines

- Headlines: 5-10 words
- Subheadlines: 15-25 words
- Feature descriptions: 2-3 sentences max
- CTA buttons: 2-4 words

## Feature Pages Strategy

### Structure Each Feature Page

1. **Headline**: Benefit-focused, not feature-focused
2. **The Problem**: What pain does this solve?
3. **The Solution**: How NestMind fixes it
4. **How It Works**: Visual demonstration
5. **CTA**: Drive to download

### Feature Headlines (Good vs Bad)

| Feature | ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Library | Smart Bookmark Management | All your saves in one place — articles, videos, todos |
| Search | Semantic Search Engine | Find that article — even if you forgot the title |
| NestAI | AI-Powered Assistant | Ask questions. Get answers from YOUR content. |
| Privacy | On-Device AI Processing | Your knowledge stays yours. No tracking. Ever. |
| Todos | Task Management | Turn knowledge into action |

## Social Proof Strategies

### What to Include (When Available)

1. **User testimonials**: Real names, real photos, specific outcomes
2. **Numbers**: "5,000+ beta testers" or "10,000 bookmarks organized"
3. **Press mentions**: Logos from tech publications
4. **App Store rating**: Star rating + review count

### How to Get Social Proof Early

1. Ask TestFlight users for testimonials via in-app prompt
2. Screenshot positive feedback from beta emails
3. Create case studies from power users
4. Track and display usage metrics

## Pricing Page Best Practices

### Transparency Builds Trust

- Show pricing clearly, no "contact us"
- Explain what's free vs Pro
- State the trial length prominently
- No hidden fees or gotchas

### Suggested Structure

```
FREE
- Save bookmarks & videos
- Basic search
- Limited audio briefings

PRO ($3.99/month or $20/year)
- Unlimited audio briefings
- AI-powered semantic search
- Priority support
- All future features

Try Pro free for 14 days. No credit card required.
```

## App Store Optimization (ASO)

### Keywords to Target

Primary: knowledge management, audio briefings, save articles, read later
Secondary: bookmark organizer, AI notes, privacy app, semantic search

### App Store Description Structure

1. **First line**: Hook with core benefit (audio)
2. **Problem statement**: Scattered bookmarks, no time to read
3. **Solution**: NestMind converts to audio
4. **Key features**: 3-5 bullet points
5. **Privacy statement**: On-device processing
6. **CTA**: Download free, try Pro

## Common Marketing Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Leading with privacy alone**: Privacy supports the value prop; it's not the value prop itself. Lead with "unified home" or "find anything."
2. **Feature lists instead of benefits**: "Semantic search" means nothing to most users. Say "find by describing what you want."
3. **Generic "save and organize" messaging**: "Save everything. Find anything." doesn't differentiate from Raindrop/Notion.
4. **Burying the best copy**: The Vision page copy ("scattered knowledge") is powerful but hidden — move it to homepage.
5. **Hiding pricing**: Frustrates users and kills trust.
6. **Too many CTAs**: One primary action per page.
7. **Not showing the unified experience**: Show bookmarks + videos + todos together in one screenshot.

## Post-Processing Pipeline (Mandatory)

After generating any content with this skill, apply these refinements in order:

1. **Writing Style Rules** — Eliminate AI patterns, fix vocabulary, check em-dash usage
   - See `../writing-style/references/writing-rules.md`

2. **Typographic Sanitizer** — Enforce professional typography, repair fragments, validate output
   - See `../typographic-sanitizer/SKILL.md`

Both passes are required before any content is considered final.
