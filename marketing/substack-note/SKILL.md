Create engaging Substack notes that spark conversation, drive newsletter subscriptions, and build community.

## Before Writing

   - `/context/icp.json` - Write for target audience
   - `/context/business-profile.json` - Reference offerings when relevant

2. **Check knowledge base** for content to repurpose from `/knowledge/`

**Character limit**: ~2,500 characters
**Best length**: 280-1,000 characters for engagement
**Goal**: Engagement, discovery, newsletter growth

## Note Frameworks

### Framework 1: Observation
```
I noticed [OBSERVATION about industry/life/work].

[BRIEF ELABORATION]

[INSIGHT or QUESTION]
```

### Framework 2: Contrarian Take
```
Unpopular opinion: [CONTRARIAN STATEMENT]

[WHY MOST PEOPLE GET IT WRONG]

[WHAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE]
```

### Framework 3: Quick Tip
```
[RESULT YOU CAN ACHIEVE]:

[SIMPLE STEP 1]
[SIMPLE STEP 2]
[SIMPLE STEP 3]

That's it. [REINFORCING STATEMENT]
```

### Framework 4: Personal Story
```
[HOOK - Something that happened]

[THE STORY - Brief, specific details]

[THE LESSON - What I learned]
```

### Framework 5: Question
```
[THOUGHT-PROVOKING QUESTION]

[CONTEXT for why you're asking]

[YOUR INITIAL THOUGHTS]

What do you think?
```

### Framework 6: Behind the Scenes
```
Working on [THING] today.

[WHAT YOU'RE DOING]

[WHY IT MATTERS]

[INVITE ENGAGEMENT]
```

### Framework 7: Curated Resource
```
[DISCOVERY] that changed how I [DO THING]:

[WHAT IT IS]

[WHY IT'S VALUABLE]

[WHERE TO FIND IT or LINK]
```

### Framework 8: Hot Take Expansion
```
[SHORT BOLD STATEMENT]

Here's what I mean:

[EXPLANATION - 2-3 short paragraphs]

Agree or disagree?
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Hook (First Line)
- Must stop the scroll
- Create curiosity or emotion
- Be specific, not generic
- Options:
  - Bold claim
  - Specific number
  - "I just..." (recency)
  - Contrarian opener
  - Question

### Body
- Short paragraphs (1-3 lines)
- One idea per note
- Specific > generic
- Personal > theoretical
- Conversational tone

### Engagement Drivers
- Ask questions
- Invite opinions
- Share genuine thoughts
- Be slightly vulnerable
- Take a stance

### Formatting
- Line breaks for readability
- Lists when appropriate
- Bold for emphasis (sparingly)
- Emojis: match voice DNA preferences

## Output Format

When generating notes, provide:

```
NOTE [NUMBER]
Framework: [Framework used]
---

[THE NOTE CONTENT]

---
Character count: [X]
Engagement type: [Conversation/Share/Save]
```

## Batch Generation

When asked for multiple notes:

1. Vary the frameworks used
2. Mix content types (observation, tip, story, question)
3. Ensure voice consistency
4. Space out promotional vs value notes

**Ideal ratio**: 4 value notes : 1 promotional note

## Content Ideas Sources

- Repurpose from newsletters in `/knowledge/`
- Extract insights from long-form content
- Share behind-the-scenes of current work
- Comment on industry trends
- Answer common questions from audience

## Note Quality Checklist

Before delivering each note:

- [ ] Hook stops the scroll
- [ ] Voice matches voice DNA
- [ ] One clear idea
- [ ] Would your ICP engage?
- [ ] Not too long (under 1,000 chars ideal)
- [ ] Ends with engagement opportunity
- [ ] Provides value or sparks thought
- [ ] Not overtly promotional (unless CTA note)

## What to Avoid

- Generic motivational content
- Unclear or vague points
- Too many ideas in one note
- Walls of text
- Clickbait without payoff
- Constant self-promotion
- Copying trending formats without authentic angle

## Example Notes

### Observation Example
```
I've written 500+ newsletters.

The ones that perform best aren't the clever ones.

They're the ones where I share exactly what's working for me right now—no theory, just practice.

People are tired of frameworks. They want what works.
```

### Quick Tip Example
```
How I write a week of content in 2 hours:

1. Brain dump 10 ideas (10 min)
2. Pick the 3 that excite me (2 min)
3. Voice memo each one (30 min)
4. Transcribe + light edit (1 hr)

AI handles the polish. I handle the thinking.
```

### Question Example
```
Here's what I keep wondering:

Why do people spend 3 hours "researching" before writing instead of just... writing?

The research is procrastination dressed up as productivity.

Am I wrong here? What's your writing process?
```
