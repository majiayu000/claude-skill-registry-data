# Marketing Mix: 4P / 7P

## Overview

The 4P (Product, Price, Place, Promotion) framework structures tactical marketing decisions. For services, extend to 7P by adding People, Process, and Physical Evidence. Unlike STP (strategic), the marketing mix is **tactical** — it answers "how do we execute?" after STP answers "for whom?"

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- User planning a product launch or go-to-market
- User needs to audit or redesign their marketing mix
- User asks "how should we price this?", "where should we sell?", or "how do we promote?"
- User has completed STP and needs the next step

**When NOT to use:**
- Before STP is done — mix without a target is unfocused
- For strategic-level decisions → use STP, SWOT, or Ansoff
- For brand identity work → use Brand Positioning

## Framework

```
IRON LAW: All Ps Must Be Internally Consistent

The 4/7 Ps must reinforce each other. A luxury product (Product) at a
budget price (Price) sold in discount stores (Place) with mass-market
ads (Promotion) is contradictory. Every P must tell the same story.

Before finalizing, check: "Does the Price match the Product? Does the
Place match the Price? Does the Promotion match the Place?"
```

```
IRON LAW: Marketing Mix Follows STP

The mix must be designed FOR the target segment identified in STP.
Different segments require different mixes. A 4P designed without
a specific target segment is guesswork.
```

### The 4Ps (Product and Service Businesses)

**Product** — What you sell
- Core benefit, features, quality level, design, branding
- Product line breadth and depth, packaging, warranty
- Question: "What does the target segment need, and how does our product deliver it?"

**Price** — What customers pay
- Pricing strategy: cost-plus, value-based, competitive, penetration, skimming
- Discounts, payment terms, price sensitivity of target segment
- Question: "What is the target segment willing to pay, and what does price signal about our positioning?"

**Place** — How customers get it
- Distribution channels: direct, retail, online, wholesale, marketplace
- Channel coverage: intensive, selective, exclusive
- Logistics, inventory, geographic availability
- Question: "Where does our target segment expect to buy, and how do we get the product there?"

**Promotion** — How customers learn about it
- Advertising, sales promotion, PR, personal selling, digital marketing
- Content marketing, social media, influencer partnerships
- Question: "Where does our target segment get information, and what message resonates?"

### The Extended 3Ps (Service Businesses)

**People** — Who delivers the service
- Employee training, customer-facing attitude, recruitment standards
- Customer's role in co-creating the service experience

**Process** — How the service is delivered
- Service delivery steps, standardization vs customization, wait times
- Technology enablement, self-service options

**Physical Evidence** — Tangible cues of service quality
- Store design, website UX, uniforms, receipts, packaging
- Anything the customer can see, touch, or experience that signals quality

### Step-by-Step

1. **Confirm target segment** (from STP)
2. **Design each P** with the target in mind
3. **Check internal consistency** across all Ps
4. **Identify gaps** — which P is weakest?
5. **Prioritize actions** — which P has the biggest impact on the target?

### Correct Application

**Scenario:** 4P for a premium Taiwanese tea brand selling bottled tea in convenience stores

| P | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| Product | Cold-brewed single-origin oolong, 350ml glass bottle, minimalist label | Premium positioning requires premium packaging and clear differentiation from PET bottle teas |
| Price | NT$65 (vs NT$25-35 for standard bottled tea) | Value-based pricing; target segment (25-40 urban professionals) views tea as a small luxury, not a commodity |
| Place | Selective distribution — 7-ELEVEN City Café section only, not general shelf | Exclusive placement reinforces premium positioning; City Café area signals "coffee-tier quality" |
| Promotion | Instagram KOL partnerships + in-store tasting events | Target segment follows lifestyle KOLs; tasting events reduce trial barrier for premium price |

**Consistency check**: Premium product ✓ → Premium price ✓ → Selective placement ✓ → Aspirational promotion ✓ — All Ps tell the same story.

### Incorrect Application

**What went wrong:**
- Premium glass-bottle tea (Product) sold at NT$25 (Price) in every store (Place) with price-cut promotions (Promotion) → Every P contradicts the premium positioning. Violates Iron Law: internal consistency.
- Designed the mix without specifying a target segment → No basis for decisions. Violates Iron Law: mix follows STP.

## Gotchas

- **Price is not just a number**: Price communicates positioning. A NT$65 tea at 7-ELEVEN says "premium but accessible." At NT$25 it says "commodity." The number is a message.
- **Place decisions are hard to reverse**: Entering discount channels erodes premium positioning permanently. Exiting a channel alienates existing customers. Choose carefully.
- **Digital changes Place and Promotion**: For online businesses, Place = platform (Shopee vs own website vs LINE Shopping) and Promotion = content + ads + SEO. The framework still applies.
- **7P for all service businesses**: If there's a human delivering the service, you need People, Process, and Physical Evidence. A SaaS product with customer success is a service business.
- **Promotion ≠ advertising only**: Promotion includes PR, events, sales, partnerships, content. Don't default to "run ads" — match the channel to where the target segment pays attention.
