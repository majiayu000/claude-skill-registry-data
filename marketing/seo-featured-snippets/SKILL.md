<objective>
Provides format-specific HTML recipes for winning featured snippets (position 0): paragraph (40-60 word direct answer), list (ordered/unordered, 4-8 items), table (comparison data), and video (embed + timestamps) — each mapped to its trigger query patterns. Explains why featured snippets are primary AI Overview training data (70%+ citation correlation) and lists snippet anti-patterns (buried answer, vague intro, marketing language in the target passage).
