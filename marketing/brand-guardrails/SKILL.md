# Social Brand Guardrails Skill

## When to Use
- Approving posts for regulated industries, embargoed launches, or co-marketing efforts.
- Auditing evergreen templates to ensure they still align with brand standards.
- Training new team members or agencies on tone, visual identity, and compliance.

## Framework
1. **Voice & Tone** – map persona-based voice guidance, inclusive language checks, and banned phrases.
2. **Visual Identity** – specify aspect ratios, typography, color usage, logo/lockup rules, accessibility.
3. **Legal & Compliance** – include disclaimers, disclosures (#ad, partner tags), export or privacy constraints.
4. **Partner & Community** – outline tagging etiquette, response time expectations, escalation triggers.
5. **Crisis & Incident Protocols** – predetermined statements, approval ladders, dark site references.

## Templates
- Brand checklist (copy, visuals, legal, partner, accessibility).
- Co-marketing alignment sheet (partner assets, approvals, CTA alignment).
- Escalation tree with contact info and SLAs.

## Tips
- Embed guardrails into creative briefs and approval workflows to reduce rework.
- Maintain snippets/examples for "approved" vs "needs revision" cases.
- Pair with `route-approvals` command to ensure reviewers reference the latest guardrails.
