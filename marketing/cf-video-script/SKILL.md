# Video Script Production

Transform a topic or existing article into a production-ready video script with timestamps, scene directions, B-roll shot lists, on-screen text, and music recommendations -- optimized for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Reels, or explainer video formats.

## When to Use

Use `/contentforge:cf-video-script` when you need:
- **YouTube scripts** (3-10 min) with SEO-optimized titles, descriptions, and chapter timestamps
- **TikTok scripts** (30-60s) with fast-cut pacing and trending audio hooks
- **Instagram Reels scripts** (30-60s) with vertical format and caption-driven storytelling
- **Explainer videos** (3-5 min) with clear visual directions and professional pacing
- **Video adaptations** of existing ContentForge articles, blogs, or whitepapers

**Not for:** Raw creative brainstorming (use `/contentforge:create-content` first for research), live stream outlines, podcast scripts.

## Supported Platforms & Lengths

| Platform | Supported Lengths | Aspect Ratio | Key Characteristics |
|----------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **YouTube** | 3min, 5min, 10min | 16:9 landscape | SEO titles, end screens, mid-roll breaks |
| **YouTube Shorts** | 15s, 30s, 60s, up to 3min | 9:16 vertical | Hook in 1-2s, loopable ending, feed-native captions |
| **TikTok** | 30s, 60s, long-form 3min-10min | 9:16 vertical | Hook in 1s, fast cuts, trending audio; long-form uses chaptered storytelling |
| **Instagram Reels** | 30s, 60s | 9:16 vertical | Captions required, visual-first storytelling |
| **Explainer** | 3min, 5min | 16:9 landscape | Slower pace, professional graphics, clear narration |

## Required Inputs

**Minimum Required:**
- **Topic or Source** -- Either a topic string ("AI in Healthcare 2026") or a ContentForge article URL/path
- **Platform** -- `youtube`, `youtube-shorts`, `tiktok`, `instagram`, or `explainer`
- **Video Length** -- `15s`, `30s`, `60s`, `3min`, `5min`, or `10min` (platform-dependent; see table above)

**Optional:**
- **Tone** -- `educational`, `entertaining`, `promotional`, or `storytelling` (defaults to platform standard)
- **Brand** -- Brand profile for voice consistency (recommended)
- **Target Audience** -- Who this video is for (e.g., "Marketing managers, 25-45")
- **Primary Keyword** -- For YouTube SEO optimization
- **CTA** -- Specific call-to-action (defaults to platform-appropriate CTA)
- **Speaker** -- On-camera host name, or "voiceover only"

```
Extracts key points from the article and restructures for video format.

## What Happens

### Phase 1: Content Research & Extraction (2-4 minutes)
- If topic provided: Research Agent gathers video-friendly data points, statistics, examples, and competitor video analysis
- If source article provided: Extracts key messages, data points, quotes, and visual opportunities
- Identifies the single strongest hook (statistic, question, or bold claim)
- Maps content to target video length (word count budget based on 120-150 words/minute dialogue)
- **Quality Gate:** Hook identified, word budget calculated, key points mapped to scenes

### Phase 2: Script Structure (2-3 minutes)

**Dispatch the agents — do not write the script inline.** Each phase below is a `Task` call with a qualified `subagent_type`, exactly as the main orchestrator dispatches its pipeline: Phase 1 → `contentforge:researcher`, Phases 2-3 → `contentforge:content-drafter`, Phase 4 → `contentforge:structurer-proofreader`. Pass file paths plus the platform, length and tone; the agents `Read` what they need.

- Content Drafter builds script following `templates/content-types/video-script-structure.md` (duration profiles: 15s, 30s, 60s, 3min, 5min, 10min)
- Allocates time to each section:
  - **HOOK:** First 3 seconds (TikTok: 1 second)
  - **INTRO:** 10-15% of total length
  - **MAIN CONTENT:** 60-70% split across scenes
  - **CTA:** 10-15% of total length
  - **OUTRO:** 5-10% (YouTube only)
- Creates scene breakdown with timestamps
- **Payoff rule (3min+ profiles):** every MAIN CONTENT scene delivers a point, not just a promise of one. No scene ends on setup — a scene that only sets up the next one is where viewers leave, so it either gets its own payoff or is folded into the scene that has one. Time allocation says how long a scene runs; the payoff rule says what it must have delivered by the time it ends.
- **Retention notes (3min+ profiles):** the script ships with the 2-3 likely drop points named (the setup stretch, the mid-video sag, the pre-CTA fade) and the hold at each — a re-hook, an open loop paid off later, a pattern interrupt. A script with no identified risk points has not been read as a viewer.
- **Quality Gate:** All sections allocated, timestamps continuous, word count within budget; for 3min+ profiles, every scene has a stated payoff and retention notes are present

### Phase 3: Scene Writing (3-5 minutes)
- Writes each scene with:
  - **Dialogue/Narration:** What the speaker says (timed to 120-150 words/min)
  - **On-Screen Text:** Key phrases, statistics, bullet points viewers see
  - **B-Roll Directions:** Specific visual descriptions for each segment
  - **Music/SFX:** Mood, tempo, and transition sound suggestions
- Applies platform-specific style:
  - YouTube: Conversational, direct address, pattern interrupts every 30-60s
  - TikTok: Punchy, fast-paced, text-heavy, trending audio references
  - Instagram: Visual-first, caption storytelling, aesthetic emphasis
  - Explainer: Clear, measured pace, professional graphics focus
- **Quality Gate:** Every scene has all 4 elements, dialogue word count matches timestamps

### Phase 3.5: Claim Verification (1-2 minutes) — the gate articles get, scripts get too

**Dispatch `contentforge:fact-checker`** on the drafted script's narration and
on-screen text. A statistic spoken in a voiceover is the same liability as one
printed in an article — worse, actually: a published article can be corrected
in place, a rendered and posted video cannot.

- Every claim, number, and named source in narration or overlays is checked
  against the Phase 1 research; anything unverifiable is rewritten to what the
  evidence supports or cut
- Spoken attribution follows the same rules as written: "studies show" with no
  study is removed, not softened
- **Quality Gate:** zero unverified claims in narration or on-screen text.
  This gate is why cf-video-script is a ContentForge skill and not a prompt —
  skipping it produces fluent scripts with confident numbers nobody checked.

### Phase 4: Structuring & Optimization (1-2 minutes)
- Structurer Agent reviews flow, pacing, and transitions between scenes
- Verifies hook strength (would you stop scrolling for this?)
- Checks CTA clarity and placement
- **Spoken-language pass on all narration**: voiceover is read aloud, so it is
  humanized for the ear, not the eye — contractions, short sentences, no
  written-prose constructions ("furthermore", "as previously mentioned"), no
  AI-pattern tells. Apply the humanizer catalog's filler/hedging and signposting
  patterns to dialogue; "Let's dive in" dies here too.
- Platform-specific optimization:
  - YouTube: End screen directions, mid-roll break points (for 8+ min), chapter timestamps
  - TikTok: Ensures hook in first 1 second, audio sync points, loop potential
  - Instagram: Caption overlay timing, visual consistency
  - Explainer: Pacing check (not too fast for complex topics)
- **Quality Gate:** Pacing feels natural when read aloud, transitions smooth, CTA actionable

### Phase 4.5: Review Scorecard (1 minute)

Score the script on five dimensions, 1-10 each, same discipline as the main
pipeline's reviewer — a script below threshold goes back to the failing phase,
not out the door:

| Dimension | What it checks |
|---|---|
| Hook | Would a cold viewer stay past the first beat? |
| Claim integrity | Phase 3.5 clean — no unverified numbers survived |
| Payoff density | Every scene delivers; no scene ends on setup |
| Retention risk | Drop points named with holds (3min+ profiles) |
| CTA | One specific ask, platform-mechanism aware |

**Pass threshold: ≥7.0 average, no dimension below 6.** Record the scorecard in
the output document — an unscored script is an unreviewed script.

### Phase 5: Output Assembly (1 minute)
- Compiles final script document
- Generates supplementary materials:
  - B-roll shot list (consolidated)
  - On-screen text list (for graphic designer)
  - Music recommendations with mood/tempo
  - YouTube metadata (title, description, tags, chapters) if applicable
- Delivers via the brand's configured tracking backend (local / Airtable / Google Drive)

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### YouTube (3min / 5min / 10min)

**Pacing:**
- Hook in first 3 seconds (bold claim, surprising stat, or question)
- Pattern interrupt every 30-60 seconds (new visual, topic shift, question)
- Mid-roll break point at ~8:00 for 10-minute videos
- End screen: 20 seconds with subscribe CTA and related video

**SEO Requirements:**
- Title: <= 60 characters, includes primary keyword, triggers curiosity
- Description: 200-300 words, timestamps (chapters), links, keywords
- Tags: 10-15 relevant tags
- Thumbnail suggestion (text overlay + visual concept)

**Dialogue Style:**
- Direct address ("you") throughout
- Conversational but authoritative
- Questions to maintain engagement ("But here's what most people miss...")
- Data points with context, not just numbers

### YouTube Shorts (15s / 30s / 60s / up to 3min)

**Pacing:**
- Hook in first 1-2 seconds (text overlay + visual jolt)
- Loopable ending (last beat flows back into the hook — Shorts feed rewards rewatches)
- One idea per Short; for 2-3min Shorts, use a 3-beat structure (hook → payoff steps → loop/CTA)

**Style:**
- 9:16 vertical, burned-in captions (assume sound-off starts)
- Title-safe zone: keep text clear of the bottom UI overlay
- CTA: "subscribe" works better than external links (Shorts don't support link cards)

### TikTok (30s / 60s / long-form 3-10min)

**Pacing:**
- Hook in first 1 second (text overlay + audio hook)
- New visual or text every 2-3 seconds
- Fast cuts between points (no lingering shots)
- End with loop potential (last frame connects to first)
- **Long-form (3-10min):** open with a payoff promise, break content into on-screen chapters, re-hook every 45-60 seconds; TikTok promotes watch-time on longer videos

**Style:**
- Text-heavy: Every key point has on-screen text
- Audio: Reference trending sounds or use voiceover with background music
- Casual, high-energy tone (even for educational content)
- Bold, simple language (no complex sentences)

**Format:**
- 9:16 vertical
- Captions auto-generated but script should assume sound-off viewing
- Green screen / talking head + B-roll intercuts

### Instagram Reels (30s / 60s)

**Pacing:**
- Hook in first 2 seconds (visual + caption)
- Caption-driven storytelling (assume sound-off for 60% of viewers)
- Smooth transitions (no hard cuts like TikTok)
- Aesthetic consistency with brand visual identity

**Style:**
- Visual-first: Every scene needs a strong visual concept
- Captions: Required, styled to brand fonts/colors
- Music: Background mood music, lower energy than TikTok
- Professional but approachable

### Explainer Video (3min / 5min)

**Pacing:**
- Hook in first 5 seconds (problem statement)
- Slower, measured delivery (120 words/min max)
- Pause after key points for viewer absorption
- Clear section transitions with visual markers

**Style:**
- Professional voiceover (no on-camera unless specified)
- Motion graphics and animated diagrams as primary visuals
- Data visualizations for statistics
- Clean, branded color palette throughout

## Dialogue Word Count Targets

| Length | Target Words | Words/Min | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| 15s | 30-38 | 120-150 | Shorts-only; single point + loop |
| 30s | 60-75 | 120-150 | Tight, every word counts |
| 60s | 120-150 | 120-150 | Room for one key point + CTA |
| 3min | 360-450 | 120-150 | 3-4 main scenes (also max Shorts length) |
| 5min | 600-750 | 120-150 | 4-5 main scenes |
| 10min | 1,200-1,500 | 120-150 | 6-8 main scenes + mid-roll break (YouTube) or chapters (TikTok long-form) |

## MCP Integrations

### Optional (none required)
- **Google Drive** -- Only needed if the brand's tracking backend is Google Sheets + Drive, or when running in Cowork. Local and Airtable backends deliver the script without it.
- **Google Sheets** -- Tracking updates with video script metadata
- **Notion** -- Alternative output destination for video production teams

## Limitations

- **No video production** -- This produces scripts, not finished videos
- **Music is suggestive** -- Recommendations for mood/tempo, not licensed track names
- **B-roll is descriptive** -- Shot list describes what to film/source, not actual footage
- **Platform algorithms change** -- SEO and pacing recommendations based on current best practices
- **Branded visuals** -- Script describes visual concepts but does not produce graphics

## Troubleshooting

### "Source article too long for target video length"
**Cause:** Article has more content than the video length can accommodate.
**Solution:** Script automatically selects the highest-impact points. Override with `--focus="section 2, section 4"` to prioritize specific sections.

### "Hook score below threshold"
**Cause:** Opening 3 seconds lack a strong enough attention grabber.
**Solution:** Script loops back and regenerates hooks (up to 3 attempts). If persistent, provide a specific hook with `--hook="Did you know 73% of..."`.

### "Word count exceeds time budget"
**Cause:** Dialogue written at > 150 words/minute pace.
**Solution:** Structurer Agent trims sections to fit. Review trimmed content in the script notes.
