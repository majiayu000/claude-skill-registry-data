# Nurture Personalization Logic Skill

## When to Use
- Building dynamic content for lifecycle nurtures.
- Mapping personalization tokens (industry, role, behavior) to copy blocks.
- Coordinating personalization across email, in-app, ads, and SDR assists.

## Framework
1. **Segmentation Inputs** – persona, industry, product usage, lifecycle stage, engagement history.
2. **Content Blocks** – hero, proof, CTA, offer modules with variants per segment.
3. **Token Management** – define data sources, fallback values, formatting rules.
4. **Testing Plan** – structure A/B/C tests for personalization depth.
5. **Governance** – approval workflows, localization, compliance, expirations.

## Templates
- Personalization matrix (segment vs module vs asset).
- Token dictionary (field, source, fallback, formatting).
- QA checklist (seed records, fallback coverage, compliance notes).

## Tips
- Start with modular blocks so ops can update without rewriting entire emails.
- Document dependencies on upstream data hygiene.
- Pair with `copywriting` + `design` teams for brand consistency.
