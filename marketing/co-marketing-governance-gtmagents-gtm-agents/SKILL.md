# Co-Marketing Governance Skill

## When to Use
- Planning joint campaigns, launches, or events with partners.
- Managing MDF budgets, approvals, and performance tracking.
- Preparing partner QBRs or exec updates focused on demand-generation impact.

## Framework
1. **Program Intake** – business case, audience, KPIs, required assets, legal/compliance checks.
2. **Approval Workflow** – decision matrix for marketing, partner, and finance stakeholders.
3. **Execution Cadence** – sprint plan, shared tracking sheets, and content governance.
4. **Measurement & Attribution** – agreed metrics (MQLs, pipeline, revenue, influence) + reporting cadence.
5. **Closeout & Learnings** – retro template, MDF reconciliation, and next-play recommendations.

## Templates
- Co-marketing brief + approval form.
- MDF budget tracker with forecast vs actuals.
- Post-campaign report outline with KPIs and narrative prompts.

## Tips
- Align messaging with joint solution blueprints to keep storytelling consistent.
- Attach MDF approval deadlines to campaign calendars to avoid delays.
- Pair with `run-partner-qbr` to highlight impact and secure additional investment.
