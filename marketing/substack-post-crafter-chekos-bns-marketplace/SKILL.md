# Substack Post Crafter Skill

## The Email-First Mindset

Substack is primarily email. Every design decision should optimize for:
1. **Subject line** (determines open)
2. **Preview text** (first 40-90 chars of subtitle)
3. **Hook** (determines if they keep reading)
4. **Mobile readability** (80% of email opens are on mobile)

## Subject Line Mastery

Your subject line = your post title. It determines everything.

### The 7-Word Rule

Studies show 7 words hit the sweet spot between too short and too long. Aim for **30-50 characters** to fit mobile screens.

### Subject Line Formulas

**Curiosity Gap:**
```
"The mistake everyone makes with [topic]"
"Why [common belief] is wrong"
"I finally figured out [thing]"
```

**Value-Forward:**
```
"How to [achieve result] in [timeframe]"
"[Number] ways to [accomplish goal]"
"The complete guide to [topic]"
```

**Story Hook:**
```
"What happened when I [did thing]"
"I almost gave up on [thing]. Then..."
"The day everything changed"
```

**Direct/Clear:**
```
"[Topic]: What you need to know"
"Your weekly [topic] update"
"[Specific thing] explained"
```

### What NOT to Do

- Clickbait that doesn't deliver
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation!!!
- Vague titles that could be anything
- Too clever/cute (clarity > cleverness)

### A/B Testing

Available for publications with 200+ subscribers. Substack tests two titles with a portion of your list, then sends the winner to the rest.

## Open Rate Benchmarks

| Open Rate | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| 70%+ | Exceptional |
| 50%+ | Great (platform average) |
| 40%+ | Good, solid engagement |
| 30%+ | Needs improvement |
| <20% | Deliverability or relevance issues |

**Caveat**: Apple Mail Privacy Protection inflates open rates. Focus on click-through rates and replies for accurate signals.

## Post Structure

### The Anatomy of a High-Performing Post

```
TITLE (Subject Line)
↓
SUBTITLE (Preview text — first 40-90 chars visible)
↓
HOOK (First 1-2 paragraphs — stops the scroll)
↓
BODY (The value — structured, scannable)
↓
TEASER (Cliffhanger for next issue)
↓
CTA (What you want them to do)
```

### The Hook

80% of readers never get past the headline. Your hook determines if they read the body.

**Hook Strategies:**

1. **Start with the payoff**
   - Don't bury the lead
   - "Here's the thing no one tells you about [X]..."

2. **Open with story**
   - Immediate scene, not setup
   - "Last Tuesday, I almost deleted everything..."

3. **Provocative question**
   - Challenge assumptions
   - "What if everything you know about [X] is wrong?"

4. **Bold statement**
   - Take a clear position
   - "[Common practice] is killing your [outcome]."

**Common mistake**: Your best hook is often buried 3-5 paragraphs in. During revision, ask: "Where does this get interesting?"

### Body Structure

**For Scanners (Most Readers):**
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Subheadings every 200-300 words
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold key phrases
- Pull quotes for emphasis

**Formatting Best Practices:**
- One idea per paragraph
- White space is your friend
- Use horizontal rules to separate sections
- Images break up long text
- Consider mobile first

## The Cliff-Hanger Technique

One creator accidentally discovered that ending posts with specific previews of upcoming content increased their next issue's open rate from 34% to **74%**.

### How to Implement

**Instead of:**
```
See you next week!
```

**Do this:**
```
Next week: I'm breaking down the exact system I used to
[achieve result] — including the template I use every day.

You won't want to miss this one.
```

### Template
```
Coming next [day]:

→ [Specific, compelling preview of content]
→ [What they'll learn or get]
→ [Why it matters to them]

Make sure you don't miss it.
```

This creates anticipation and primes subscribers to open.

## Notes vs Newsletter

Notes and newsletters serve different purposes:

| Newsletter | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Deep value | Quick visibility |
| Builds trust | Builds reach |
| 1-3x per week | 1-3x per day |
| Long-form | Snackable |
| Email-first | Feed-first |

### Repurposing Content

**Newsletter → Notes:**
- Pull key insight as standalone Note
- Share a provocative quote
- Ask a question the newsletter answers
- Post "teaser" with link to full issue

**Notes → Newsletter:**
- Expand well-received Notes into full posts
- Compile related Notes into a newsletter
- Use Notes engagement to validate topics

## SEO Integration

Substack posts can rank on Google. For tacosdedatos (educational content), this matters.

### SEO Basics for Substack

1. **Target long-tail keywords**
   - Not: "pandas tutorial"
   - Yes: "pandas groupby tutorial español paso a paso"

2. **Keyword placement**
   - Title (subject line)
   - Subtitle
   - First paragraph
   - Subheadings
   - Naturally throughout

3. **Connect Google Search Console**
   - Monitor rankings
   - Identify opportunities

4. **Evergreen vs Timely**
   - Evergreen content = long-term SEO value
   - Balance with timely/news content

### Substack SEO Reality

- Google now crawls Substack posts within hours (median: 3 hours)
- Custom domains may rank slightly better than .substack.com
- High-quality, specific content performs best

## Spanish-Language Patterns

### For tacosdedatos

**Headline Style:**
```
"Cómo [lograr resultado] con [herramienta]"
"La guía completa de [tema] en español"
"[Número] errores que cometes con [tema]"
"Lo que nadie te dice sobre [tema]"
```

**Hook Style:**
```
Directo al grano. Sin rodeos.

[Primera oración impactante que establece el tema]

En este newsletter vamos a ver:
→ [Punto 1]
→ [Punto 2]
→ [Punto 3]
```

**Closing Style:**
```
La próxima semana:

Vamos a profundizar en [tema específico] — incluyendo
[algo concreto y valioso].

Nos vemos el [día].

— [Nombre]
```

### LATAM Considerations

- Spanish-speaking Substack community is small but growing (+1,514% growth possible)
- Platform is Anglo-centric but opportunity exists
- Collaborate with other Hispanic creators
- Use Mexican Spanish for tacosdedatos audience

## Welcome Email Optimization

The most-opened email you'll ever send.

### Best Practices

- **Length**: 50-125 words optimal (50% response rates)
- **Tone**: Sounds like YOU, not corporate
- **Include**: Upgrade CTA above the fold (for free tier)
- **Ask**: Reply with why they subscribed
- **Guide**: Link to best posts or "Start Here"
- **Deliverability**: Ask to move to Primary tab / add to contacts

### Template Structure
```
Subject: Bienvenido/a a tacosdedatos

[1-2 sentence personal greeting]

[What they can expect: frequency, topics]

[1 specific CTA — reply, read this post, etc.]

[Brief upgrade mention if applicable]

[Sign-off]
```
