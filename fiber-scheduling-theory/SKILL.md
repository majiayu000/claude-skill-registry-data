# Fiber Scheduling Theory (React 18)

## Summary

Apply deep knowledge of Fiber scheduling to reason about rendering priorities, preemption, and starvation avoidance.

## Key Capabilities

- Interpret scheduler lanes and priority escalation behavior.
- Model preemption effects on UI atomicity guarantees.
- Diagnose starvation risks and mitigate via boundary design.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Construct a formal scheduling model for multi-lane updates.
- Derive starvation bounds under adversarial update patterns.
- Evaluate performance regressions using synthetic lane stress tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Present a lane diagram for a complex interaction scenario.
- Validate that high-priority input stays responsive under load.
- Explain trade-offs in at least two real scheduling decisions.
