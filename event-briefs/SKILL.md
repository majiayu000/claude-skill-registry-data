# Event Brief Systems Skill

## When to Use
- Kicking off any event (webinar, field, flagship).
- Aligning cross-functional partners before production starts.
- Handing event concepts to producers or regional teams.

## Framework
1. **Overview** – goal, target audience, date, format, tier.
2. **Narrative** – theme, key messages, CTA, proof assets.
3. **Experience** – agenda, speakers, demos, activations.
4. **Promotion** – channels, audience segments, partner amplification.
5. **Operations** – budgets, vendors, timelines, risks, approvals.
6. **Measurement** – KPIs, dashboards, survey plan, follow-up flows.

## Templates
- Master event brief doc (editable copy with the sections above preformatted).
- Reviewer checklist (approvals, dependencies, instrumentation, follow-up).
- Handoff packet outline for producers/regional teams.

## Checklist
- ✅ Approvers + owners defined.
- ✅ Dependencies captured (product readiness, content, sales enablement).
- ✅ Data instrumentation planned.
- ✅ Post-event follow-up mapped.

## Tips
- Keep briefs in shared workspace; version by event iteration.
- Reuse sections for series; highlight delta vs prior runs.
- Pair with `manage-production` outputs to ensure continuity.
