# Instrument an LLM app for observability

Add production-grade tracing to an LLM/agent app so every run is inspectable: prompts, tool calls, retrievals, token usage, latency, and cost per span.

## Decide the approach first (2 questions)

1. **Is a backend already chosen?** (Langfuse, Arize Phoenix, Comet Opik, Datadog, Grafana…). If yes, use its SDK/auto-instrumentation. If no, default to **OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions** so traces export to *any* OTel backend and you avoid lock-in.
2. **Lowest-friction path available?** If the app calls LLMs through a **gateway/proxy** (LiteLLM, Helicone, Portkey), you may get tracing + cost with *zero code* by changing the base URL. Check that before adding an SDK.

## Vendor-neutral path (recommended default): OpenTelemetry

Emit `gen_ai.*` spans via an OTel instrumentation library, then point at any collector.

- Use **OpenLLMetry** (`traceloop-sdk`) or **OpenInference** (Arize) - both emit OTel-compatible LLM spans.
- Minimal shape:
  1. Install the instrumentation lib + an OTLP exporter.
  2. Initialize once at startup (set service name + OTLP endpoint via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`).
  3. Auto-instrument the LLM SDK (OpenAI/Anthropic/etc.); wrap custom agent steps in manual spans (`gen_ai.operation.name`, tool spans).
- Result: spans carry model, prompt/completion, token counts, latency; cost is derived downstream.

See `references/opentelemetry.md` for the exact span attributes to set and a copy-paste init.

## Platform SDK path (if a backend is already picked)

Wrap the LLM client with the platform's tracer (e.g. `track_openai(...)`, `@observe`, an OTel exporter to that backend). Prefer their **auto-instrumentation** over hand-rolled spans; add manual spans only for custom tool/retrieval steps the SDK can't see.

## Instrument the right things (checklist)

- [ ] Each LLM call: model, input messages, output, `prompt_tokens`/`completion_tokens`, latency.
- [ ] Tool/function calls: name, args, result, error.
- [ ] Retrieval steps (RAG): query, retrieved doc IDs/scores.
- [ ] Agent/chain boundaries: one parent span per user request, child spans per step.
- [ ] Errors: record exceptions on the span (don't swallow them - a silent `except` that returns empty output hides the failure).
- [ ] Cost: derive from token counts × model price (most platforms do this for you).

## Verify

Run one representative request and confirm the trace tree shows the full chain (parent → LLM/tool/retrieval children) with tokens + latency populated. If spans are missing, the instrumentation isn't wrapping that code path - instrument it manually.

## Anti-patterns

- Logging raw prints instead of structured spans (no trace tree, no cost rollup).
- Instrumenting only the top-level call, missing tool/retrieval steps (the interesting failures hide there).
- Hard-coding a vendor SDK when OTel would keep you portable.
- Sending full prompts/PII to a third-party backend without redaction - mask sensitive fields first.
