# First-Run Onboarding

## Purpose

Guide a new user through Genesis setup on their first interactive CC session.
By the end, every critical subsystem is configured and verified live.

This skill is triggered automatically while the install is not yet **functional**
— i.e. the setup *floor* (`genesis.onboarding.floor`: Claude Code login + at least
one LLM/routing key + at least one embedding key) is unmet. It is NOT gated on the
`~/.genesis/setup-complete` marker (that marker means "bootstrap finished" and does
not imply a working brain). So a bootstrapped box that is still missing keys is
still guided here. It can also be invoked manually by asking Genesis to "run setup"
or "reconfigure [section]" to re-run specific sections.

## Pre-Conditions

Before this skill runs, `install.sh` (Layer 1) has already completed:
- Python venv, dependencies, systemd services
- Qdrant installed and running
- Template-generated `.claude/settings.json` and `.mcp.json`
- Claude Code logged in
- `secrets.env` created from template (may be empty)

This skill handles everything that benefits from conversational guidance rather
than scripted prompts.

## Internal References

The `references/provider-guide.md` file in this skill directory contains
detailed information about every API provider Genesis supports — what each key
unlocks, where to sign up, pricing tiers, and env var names. **Read this file
during Step 2 and Step 5** to give the user accurate, specific information.
Do not expect the user to read it themselves — you present the relevant parts
conversationally.

## Partial Re-Run

If the user asks to reconfigure a specific section (e.g., "reconfigure secrets",
"reconfigure telegram"), skip to that section only.

If `~/.genesis/setup-complete` already exists, inform the user: "Onboarding was
already completed on [date]. Running the requested section only." Then proceed
with just the requested section (or offer a menu if no argument given).

---

## Overview: Two-Phase Setup

**Phase A — Essentials (Steps 1-4):** These MUST be completed before onboarding
can finish. Without them, Genesis cannot function. Do not let the user skip
past these.

**Phase B — Expansion (Step 5):** Additional providers and capabilities the user
can configure now or come back to later. Exploratory — show what's possible,
let the user decide how deep to go.

The transition between phases should feel natural:

> Good — the core system is working. Now let me show you what else you can
> configure to get more out of Genesis. None of this is required right now,
> but each key you add opens up new capabilities.

---

## PHASE A: ESSENTIALS

### Step 1: Welcome + Identity

Introduce yourself. Be warm but direct — the user is here to get things working,
not to read a manual.

**Say something like:**

> I'm Genesis. This is our first session together, so let me help you get
> everything configured. This will take a few minutes — by the end, you'll have
> a fully operational system with verified API connections.
>
> First, let me learn a bit about you so I can tailor how I work.

**Gather (conversationally, not as a form):**
- Name and timezone
- Professional background (briefly — what do they do?)
- What they want Genesis to help with (primary use cases)
- Communication preferences (brief vs. detailed, proactive vs. on-demand)

**Write results to:**
- `src/genesis/identity/USER.md` — update the user profile section
- Set `USER_TIMEZONE` in `secrets.env` if provided

**Do NOT ask all questions at once.** One or two at a time, naturally.

---

### Step 2: Core API Keys

**Principle: User sovereignty over secrets.** Default to showing where things
are, not asking for keys. Let the user choose their comfort level.

1. Read `secrets.env` and check which keys are configured vs. empty.

2. Read `references/provider-guide.md` to have full provider details available.

3. **Report status clearly:**
   > Here's your current API key status:
   >
   > **Configured:** [list any that have values]
   > **Not yet configured:** [list empty ones]
   >
   > Your secrets file is at: `~/genesis/secrets.env`

4. **Explain what's essential and why:**
   > To get Genesis fully operational, we need three things:
   >
   > **1. An LLM provider** — this is Genesis's brain. I use language models for
   > reasoning, reflection, triage, and every cognitive task. **OpenRouter** is
   > the simplest option — one key covers 200+ models and I'll route to the best
   > one for each task. Sign up at openrouter.ai/keys.
   >
   > **2. An embedding provider** — this is how I remember things. Embeddings
   > turn text into vectors for semantic search. **DeepInfra** is fast and cheap
   > (~$0.01/M tokens). Sign up at deepinfra.com.
   >
   > **3. Telegram** — this is how I reach you. Morning reports, alerts, proactive
   > insights — all of Genesis's outreach happens over Telegram. Without it, I
   > can only talk to you when you open a session.
   >
   > These three make Genesis fully functional. We can't move forward without
   > at least the LLM and embedding keys.

5. **Respect their choice on HOW to provide keys:**
   > You can edit `secrets.env` directly with any editor — nano, vim, or
   > transfer the file with SFTP/SCP. Or if you'd prefer, you can paste your
   > API keys here and I'll write them to the file for you. Your choice.

6. If they provide keys, write them to `secrets.env` using the Edit tool:
   - Read the file first
   - Find the line with the matching env var name (e.g., `API_KEY_OPENROUTER=`)
   - Replace the empty value with the provided key
   - If the line doesn't exist, append it at the end of the appropriate section
   - Run `chmod 600 secrets.env` after writing
   - **Never echo keys back to the user** — acknowledge with "Saved" only

7. **Telegram setup** (essential, not optional):
   > Let's set up Telegram so I can reach you outside of these sessions.
   > You'll need to create a bot via @BotFather on Telegram — it takes about
   > 30 seconds. Here's how:
   >
   > 1. Open Telegram, search for @BotFather, start a chat
   > 2. Send `/newbot`, pick a name and username
   > 3. Copy the bot token it gives you

   - Write `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` to secrets.env
   - Ask for their Telegram user ID for `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`
   - If they have a forum/group chat: ask for `TELEGRAM_FORUM_CHAT_ID`
   - Test: send a message via the `outreach_send` MCP tool
   - If they want to skip Telegram for now, allow it but note it as degraded:
     "Okay — Genesis will work without Telegram, but I won't be able to send
     you morning reports or alerts. You can set this up later."

8. **Gate check:** Do NOT proceed past this step until at least one LLM key
   and one embedding key are configured and the user has acknowledged the
   Telegram decision (configured or explicitly deferred).

---

### Step 3: GitHub + Backup

1. Check GitHub auth: `gh auth status`

2. **If not authenticated:**
   > Genesis backs up your data every 6 hours to a private GitHub repo —
   > your database, memories, configuration, and session transcripts. Let's
   > get GitHub set up.
   >
   > Run this command: `gh auth login`
   > (Type `! gh auth login` at the CC prompt to run it in this session.)

   Wait for them to complete it, then verify with `gh auth status`.

3. **Once authenticated:**
   - Detect GitHub username from `gh auth status`
   - Ask: "What would you like to name your backup repo? Default: `genesis-backups`"
   - Check if repo exists: `gh repo view <user>/genesis-backups`
   - If not, offer to create: `gh repo create genesis-backups --private`

4. Write `GENESIS_BACKUP_REPO=<user>/genesis-backups` to `secrets.env`.

5. **Set the backup passphrase** (required for encryption):
   - Check if `GENESIS_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` is already set to a non-empty value in `secrets.env`.
   - If not set, generate one: `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - Write the output as `GENESIS_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE=<value>` to `secrets.env`.
   - **Critical: store this passphrase in a password manager off-machine.**
     Backups are AES-256 encrypted with this key. If this machine dies and
     the passphrase only lives in `secrets.env`, the backups cannot be
     decrypted. There is no recovery without it.

6. Verify backup script can reach it: `git ls-remote https://github.com/<user>/genesis-backups.git`

7. **Configure Tier 2 (large data).** GitHub (Tier 1) holds only small encrypted
   text — memory, config, secrets. The large binaries (SQLite DB, Qdrant
   snapshots, transcripts) are gitignored from GitHub and need a separate
   target, or they stay **local-only (no off-machine backup)**. Ask the user:
   - **NAS (SMB):** set `GENESIS_BACKUP_NAS=//host/share`,
     `GENESIS_BACKUP_NAS_USER`, `GENESIS_BACKUP_NAS_PASS` in `secrets.env`
     (requires `smbclient`).
   - **No NAS:** allowed, but say so explicitly — the DB/Qdrant/transcripts will
     NOT be replicated off-machine until a Tier 2 target is set. (A cloud option
     via rclone is planned but not yet wired.)

8. **Run one verify backup and confirm it succeeded** (do NOT proceed if it
   fails): `bash "$HOME/genesis/scripts/backup.sh"`, then check
   `~/.genesis/backup_status.json` shows `"success": true` (and
   `"tier2_status": "ok"` if a NAS was configured).

9. **Enable the 6h backup timer — only after the verify run passed.**
   `systemctl --user enable --now genesis-backup.timer` (the unit files are
   installed by bootstrap but left disabled). Confirm with
   `systemctl --user list-timers genesis-backup.timer`. This is done HERE,
   deliberately — never auto-enabled at bootstrap — so backups are an opt-in,
   verified setup, not a switch flipped for every install. (Do NOT also add a
   crontab entry — the timer is the single scheduler; two would double every
   backup.)

---

### Step 4: Endpoint Verification Gate (MANDATORY)

This is the essential verification. Every configured key gets tested live.
**Phase A does not complete without critical endpoints passing.**

For each configured provider, make a lightweight API call:

1. **LLM providers** — Use the `health_status` MCP tool which runs
   `validate_api_keys()` internally. This tests each configured provider
   with a real HTTP request.

2. **Embedding provider** — Test with a real embedding:
   - Use the `memory_store` MCP tool to store a test memory, or
   - Call the embedding health check via `health_status`

3. **Qdrant** — Verify the vector database is running and writable:
   - Store a test memory via `memory_store`
   - Recall it via `memory_recall`
   - This proves the full pipeline: embed -> store -> retrieve

4. **Telegram** (if configured) — Send a test message:
   > If you received a Telegram message from me, it's working!

5. **Backup repo** (if configured) — `git ls-remote` to verify push access.

6. **Database** — Check that `genesis.db` exists and is writable:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/genesis/data/genesis.db
   ```

7. **CC hooks** — Already verified (the SessionStart hook triggered this flow).

**Report:**
> Endpoint Verification:
> - OpenRouter: PASS (models endpoint responded)
> - DeepInfra: PASS (embedding returned 1024-dim vector)
> - Qdrant: PASS (write + read cycle successful)
> - Telegram: PASS (test message delivered)
> - Backup repo: PASS (push access verified)
> - Database: PASS
> - CC Hooks: PASS (you're seeing this because they work)
>
> All critical endpoints verified. The core system is operational.

If any CRITICAL endpoint fails (LLM or embedding), explain the error and help
fix it before proceeding. Do not complete Phase A with broken critical
endpoints.

**Transition to Phase B:**
> Good — the core system is working. You have a functional brain (LLM),
> memory (embeddings + Qdrant), [and communication (Telegram) if configured].
>
> Now let me show you what else you can configure. None of this is required
> right now, but each provider you add opens up new capabilities. You can
> always come back to this later — just ask me to "reconfigure" anything.

---

## PHASE B: EXPANSION

### Step 5: Additional Providers & Capabilities

This step is exploratory. Read `references/provider-guide.md` and present
options based on the user's interests from Step 1.

**Structure the conversation around capability categories, not provider lists.**
The user cares about what they can DO, not what API they need.

> Here's what you can unlock with additional API keys. I'll explain what
> each one gives you — tell me which sound useful and I'll help set them up.

**Speed & Volume (LLM providers):**
- **Groq** — Extremely fast inference. I use it for 13+ tasks like triage,
  classification, and speech-to-text. Free tier available (30 requests/min).
- **Google Gemini** — Generous free tier. I use it for 12+ background tasks
  like consolidation, outreach drafting, and research. Great for high-volume
  work.
- **Mistral** — 19 call sites. Reflection, triage calibration. Also provides
  embedding models as another fallback.

**Deep Reasoning:**
- **Anthropic API** — Not the same as your Claude Code subscription. This key
  lets me run deep/strategic reflections autonomously in the background.
  7 call sites for the heavyweight cognitive tasks.
- **DeepSeek** — Very cheap reasoning. Good supplementary provider.

**Research & Web:**
- **Brave Search** — Web search for research tasks. 2,000 free queries/month.
- **Perplexity** — Deep orchestrated research with citations.

**Voice (if relevant to user):**
- **ElevenLabs** or **Cartesia** — Voice responses. Only relevant if user
  wants TTS output.

**For each provider the user wants to add:**
1. Explain what it unlocks (use specific call site counts from the guide)
2. Tell them where to sign up
3. Accept the key (paste or self-service)
4. Verify it works via `health_status`

**Point to the Neural Monitor:**
> You can always check which providers are active and how they're performing
> on the Neural Monitor dashboard. Once the system is running, it shows
> real-time status for every provider, circuit breaker states, and cost
> tracking.

**When the user is done exploring (or wants to stop):**
> You can always come back to add more providers later — just ask me to
> "reconfigure" or check the Neural Monitor to see what's active.

---

### Step 6: Inbox Monitor (if relevant)

Only offer if the user expressed interest in background research or content
processing in Step 1.

> I can watch a folder (`~/inbox/`) for files you want me to process in the
> background. Drop a markdown file with URLs or topics and I'll research them
> and store what I find. Want to enable this?

If yes, create `~/inbox/` and confirm the inbox monitor service is enabled.

---

## COMPLETION

### Step 7: First Memory

Store something meaningful from this conversation. This proves the full memory
pipeline works AND gives Genesis its first real memory.

> Let me store our first conversation as a memory — this proves the whole
> pipeline works and gives me something to remember you by.

Use `memory_store` to save a summary of:
- The user's name and background (from Step 1)
- What they want to use Genesis for
- Key configuration choices they made

Then immediately `memory_recall` with a relevant query to prove retrieval works.

> I just stored and retrieved our conversation. Ask me about this tomorrow
> and I'll remember.

---

### Step 8: Write Marker + Summary

1. **Write the completion marker:**
   ```bash
   echo "$(date -Is)" > ~/.genesis/setup-complete
   ```

2. **Summary:**
   > Setup complete! Here's what we configured:
   >
   > **Essential (Phase A):**
   > - **Profile:** [name], [timezone]
   > - **LLM:** [providers configured]
   > - **Embeddings:** [provider]
   > - **Telegram:** [configured / deferred]
   > - **Backup:** [repo or "not configured"]
   > - **All critical endpoints:** Verified
   >
   > **Additional (Phase B):**
   > - [list any additional providers configured, or "None yet — you can add
   >   more anytime"]
   >
   > **What's next:**
   > - I'll remember everything from this conversation
   > - Background processes will start (health monitoring, reflection cycles)
   > - [If Telegram configured:] You'll get your first morning report tomorrow
   > - Check the Neural Monitor to see system status anytime
   > - Talk to me anytime — I'm always learning
   >
   > If you ever want to reconfigure anything, just ask:
   > "reconfigure secrets", "reconfigure github", "reconfigure telegram",
   > "add a new provider", "run verification"

---

## Important Rules

- **Never rush.** If the user wants to do one step at a time across multiple
  sessions, that's fine. Save progress and pick up where they left off.
- **Never store API keys in memory.** They go to `secrets.env` only.
- **Never display API keys back to the user.** Acknowledge receipt, don't echo.
- **If something breaks, fix it.** Don't skip broken steps — the whole point
  is getting everything working.
- **Phase A is non-negotiable.** LLM + embedding must be configured and verified.
  Telegram is strongly recommended but can be deferred. Everything else in
  Phase B is truly optional.
- **Match the user's pace.** If they're technical and moving fast, be concise.
  If they're exploring, be more explanatory.
- **Present capabilities, not API names.** The user cares about "I can do web
  research" not "you need API_KEY_BRAVE." Lead with what they gain.
- **The Neural Monitor is the ongoing reference.** Point users there for
  real-time provider status, cost tracking, and capability overview. Don't
  try to replicate that information in conversation.
