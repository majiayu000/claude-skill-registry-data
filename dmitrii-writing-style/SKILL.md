# Dmitrii's Writing Style

<purpose>
Capture Dmitrii's distinctive writing voice for all content: direct, warm, intellectually curious, and action-oriented.
</purpose>

<when_to_activate>
**MANDATORY** — Invoke for ANY content creation on Dmitrii's behalf:
- Case studies, portfolio content, blog posts, articles
- Mid-to-long form content (500+ words)
- Proposals, PRDs, specifications
- Emails, professional correspondence

**Trigger phrases:** "write", "draft", "compose", "create [content]", "help me write"
</when_to_activate>

## Core Voice Characteristics

**Direct and Action-Oriented**: Get to the point. Lead with the substance. Dmitrii values clarity over elaborate setups.

**Warm but Professional**: Friendly tone without being informal. Uses natural language that flows like conversation, not corporate-speak.

**Intellectually Curious**: Willing to probe deeper, ask "why," and challenge surface-level answers. Not afraid to admit uncertainty ("it feels that this is a bit over my head").

**Practical Problem-Solver**: Always oriented toward what can be built, shipped, or acted upon.

## Formatting Preferences

### Anti-Patterns (Avoid)
- Bullet points in emails or conversational contexts
- Excessive bold/headers in short communications
- Numbered lists unless truly sequential steps
- HTML tags in copy-paste contexts (no `<br>`, etc.)
- Robotic or overly formal phrasing
- Generic corporate language

### Preferred Patterns
- **Flowing prose** in emails and messages—ideas connected with natural transitions
- **Tables** for structured comparisons in documents (pricing, features, deliverables)
- **Clear hierarchy** in technical docs, but minimal in casual communication
- **One request per sentence** in emails—compound requests broken naturally

### When Structure IS Appropriate
- PRDs and specifications (MoSCoW tables, JTBD frameworks)
- Technical documentation (synopses, arguments, examples)
- Proposals with clear deliverables and pricing
- Research prompts with explicit constraints

## Writing by Context

### Emails & Messages
- Single flowing paragraph for simple requests
- No bullet points unless truly listing items (shopping list, etc.)
- Warm opening without being effusive ("Hi [Name]," not "Dear Esteemed...")
- Close with clear next step
- If multiple points, weave them into prose

**Example transformation:**
```
Bad:  Please:
      1. Update the system
      2. Forward to Mike
      3. Let me know if questions

Good: Could you please update the system with the attached and forward it to Mike? Let me know if you have any questions.
```

### Proposals & Business Documents
- Lead with clear objective
- Deliverables in tables or structured sections
- Pricing direct and unambiguous
- Next steps as concrete actions
- Professional but not stiff

### PRDs & Technical Specifications
- Use frameworks when appropriate (MoSCoW, JTBD, user stories)
- Clear sections with logical hierarchy
- Tables for prioritization matrices
- Explicit scope boundaries ("Won't" items)
- Technical depth where warranted

### Research Prompts & Instructions
- Explicit scope constraints (geography, timeframe, audience)
- Structured output format requirements
- Clear evaluation criteria
- Instruction to "not soften conclusions"
- Prefer truth over excitement

### Reflective & Philosophical Writing
- Deep engagement without pretension
- Probing questions to push past surface answers
- Comfort with uncertainty and ambiguity
- Uses analogies and thought experiments naturally
- Willing to sit with paradox

## Vocabulary & Phrasing

### Prefer
- "scope out" over "define"
- "crisp and clear" over "concise"
- "flows well" over "is readable"
- "makes sense" over "is logical"
- "up my alley" over "aligned with my interests"
- "crack [a problem]" over "solve"
- Active voice throughout

### Avoid
- Jargon for its own sake
- Hedging language when confidence is warranted
- Apologetic qualifiers ("just," "maybe," "I think perhaps...")
- Filler phrases ("In order to," "It should be noted that...")

## Domain Voice

Dmitrii operates at the intersection of:
- **Web3/Blockchain**: Comfortable with protocol terminology, tokenomics, on-chain concepts
- **Product Management**: JTBD, MoSCoW, user stories, roadmaps
- **Institutional Compliance**: KYC/AML, regulatory frameworks, audit requirements
- **AI/Agents**: Agent identity, attestation, autonomy

When writing in these domains, use precise terminology without over-explaining basics—assume technical competence in the reader.

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing any writing, verify:
1. Could this be said more directly?
2. Are there bullet points that should be prose?
3. Does it sound like a human wrote it?
4. Is the ask/conclusion clear?
5. Would Dmitrii actually say this out loud?

<skill_compositions>
## Works Well With

- **generate-variant** — Voice for variant bio/taglines
- **cv-content-generator** — Authentic tone for case studies
- **technical-writer** — Balance technical accuracy with personal voice
