## Project Context: DriverConnect

### Current Project

**DriverConnect** is a B2B logistics platform for fuel delivery management. While primarily an internal tool for PT Global Logistik, it demonstrates patterns applicable to SaaS products.

#### DriverConnect Business Model

| Aspect | Details | SaaS Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer Type** | B2B (Logistics companies) | High LTV potential, longer sales cycles |
| **Value Proposition** | Real-time tracking, driver accountability, compliance | Clear ROI: reduce fuel theft, improve delivery times |
| **Deployment Model** | Currently internal | Future: white-label for other logistics companies |
| **Pricing Potential** | Per-driver or per-vehicle usage-based | Usage-based aligns with customer value |

#### Marketing Insights from DriverConnect

**Target Customer Profile (for SaaS version):**
- Logistics companies in Thailand
- 5-100+ vehicle fleets
- Pain points: fuel theft, delivery delays, driver accountability
- Decision makers: Operations managers, fleet owners

**Growth Levers Identified:**
- **Network Effects**: More stations = more value
- **Data Moat**: Historical delivery data becomes competitive advantage
- **Integration Strategy**: LINE LIFF adoption in Thailand (high penetration)

**Churn Risks:**
- Switching costs increase with data accumulation
- Driver training required (adoption friction)
- Competing with legacy GPS systems

**Thailand Market Notes:**
- LINE is dominant messaging platform (95%+ penetration)
- Mobile-first market
- Trust in local providers over foreign SaaS
