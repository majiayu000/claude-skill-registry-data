## Artist Anchoring (Power Technique)

"In the style of The Weeknd meets Daft Punk"
"Influenced by Bon Iver and James Blake"
"Hans Zimmer epic orchestral meets Aphex Twin glitch"
```

**Best Practice**: Combine 2-3 artist references for unique fusion:
```
"Radiohead atmospheric rock meets Massive Attack trip-hop
with Sigur Rós ethereal vocals"
```

## Structure Tags (Custom Mode)

In the **Lyrics** panel, use these tags:

### Essential Tags
```
[Intro]
[Verse]
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Outro]
[Instrumental]
[Drop]
```

### Advanced Tags
```
[Verse 1], [Verse 2]     - Numbered sections
[Hook]                    - Short memorable phrase
[Ad-lib]                  - Improvised vocals
[Breakdown]               - Stripped-back section
[Build]                   - Rising tension
[Refrain]                 - Repeated phrase
[Spoken Word]             - Spoken delivery

[A]                       - Uppercase for powerful delivery
```

### Structure Example
```
[Intro - Atmospheric, 8 bars]

[Verse 1]
Lyrics here with natural rhythm
Building the story line by line

[Pre-Chorus - Building energy]
Rising anticipation before the drop

[Chorus - Full power, anthemic]
The main hook that sticks in your head
Repeat it loud, let it spread

```

### Problem: Wrong Energy/Tempo
```
Solutions:
- Specify exact BPM: "exactly 128 BPM"

- Add feel descriptors: "driving", "laid-back", "hypnotic"
```

### Problem: Off-Pitch Vocals
