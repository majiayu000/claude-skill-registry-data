description: "Use when exporting a model, character or animation from Blender to a game engine, the web or a 3D printer: FBX, glTF/GLB, USD/USDZ or STL for Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, Roblox, three.js or Apple AR Quick Look. Also when an export arrives at the wrong scale (100x, 0.01), rotated 90 degrees, facing backwards, with extra leaf bones, without its animation, blend shapes or textures; when making LODs or collision meshes (UCX_, -colonly) for an engine; when converting a folder of models in batch; or when checking an exported file by re-importing it."

# Blender export (engine-ready files)

An export is done when the file has been re-imported and measured, not when the exporter returned
`FINISHED`. Gate the asset first, export with a preset, then round-trip the file. This skill builds
on `scenario-blender-expert` (execution channels, the delivery gate) and imports its scripts, so
install the two side by side. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills,
ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended,
proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

Toolkit: [`scripts/bx_export.py`](scripts/bx_export.py). Per-engine facts with their sources:
[`references/engines.md`](references/engines.md).

The Unity and Godot presets were imported into Unity 6000.3 and Godot 4.7.2 and measured; `unreal`,
`unreal_skeletal` and `roblox` follow Epic's and Roblox's documentation and pass the Blender round
trip only. The measurements live in [`references/engines.md`](references/engines.md).

## Procedure

1. **Gate.** Run `bx_audit.deliverable(parts, profile)` from `scenario-blender-expert` and fix every
   error. Scale left on an object travels into the engine as the node's transform.
2. **Pick the preset** from the table. Pass every object the file needs: a skinned mesh AND its
   armature, LOD meshes and their group, collision meshes beside their render mesh.
3. **Export:** `bxe.export(path, preset, objects, **overrides)`. Any exporter keyword overrides the
   preset, such as `bake_anim=True` on `roblox` for an animated file. The result records the
   settings used.
4. **Round-trip:** `bxe.round_trip(path, objects, preset=...)` re-imports the file in a background
   Blender, leaving the open scene alone. It compares size (1 mm), triangles, deforming bones, root
   bones (one expected), armature scale, shape keys and every action stored for the objects, by
   name. Then it lists every difference. Fix each one, or say why it is expected.
5. **glTF contents:** `bxe.glb_summary(path)` lists `extensions_required`, morph targets, skins,
   clips and image types without Blender. A loader refuses a file that requires an extension it
   lacks.
6. **Engine check:** import into the engine and look, with `scenario-unity-pipeline-automation`,
   `scenario-unreal-pipeline-automation` or `scenario-godot-pipeline-automation`.

## Scale, axes and units

- Blender works in meters, Z-up, with the asset's front facing -Y. glTF is meters, Y-up
  (`export_yup`). FBX stores its axes as metadata; the presets write -Z forward, Y up.
- Keep `scene.unit_settings.scale_length` at 1.0. Any other value rescales every export.
- Apply object scale before export: `obj.data.transform(Matrix.Diagonal(obj.scale).to_4x4())`, then
  `obj.scale = (1, 1, 1)`, so the engine node imports at scale 1.
- FBX scale: `unity` writes `FBX_SCALE_ALL` (Unity reads file scale 1). `unreal` keeps
  `FBX_SCALE_NONE` (Unity reads it as file scale 0.01, a centimeter file). `roblox` uses
  `FBX_SCALE_UNITS`, as Roblox's export requirements ask.
- STL has no unit and slicers read millimeters, so `print` multiplies by 1000.

## Characters

- Export the armature with its meshes. `use_armature_deform_only` leaves control bones out, so keep
  every deforming bone in one hierarchy under one root bone. Unreal's importer reports "Found
  multiple roots. The importer only supports one root per mesh."
- `add_leaf_bones` is off in every preset. Left on, each chain gains an extra end bone that breaks
  retargeting.
- `unity_skeletal` and `unreal_skeletal` bake every action (`bake_anim_use_all_actions`), one clip
  per action. Unity names each clip `Armature|Action` (measured: `Rig|Wave`), so name actions as the
  clips should read. glTF exports each action as an animation under its own name.
- `roblox` exports no animation. For an animated file, pass `bake_anim=True` to `export()` and to
  `round_trip()`, which then compares the actions too.
- Shape keys travel in FBX (blend shapes), glTF (morph targets, names in `extras.targetNames`) and
  USD. Building ARKit or viseme sets is `scenario-blender-rigging`'s work.
- Roblox: at most 4 influences per vertex, bones frozen (scale 1, rotation 0), root at the origin
  with no influences, one animation track per mesh. Check influences with
  `max(len(v.groups) for v in obj.data.vertices)`.

## LODs and collision

- `bxe.lods(obj, ratios=(0.5, 0.25))` renames the mesh `Name_LOD0` and adds decimated `Name_LOD1..n`
  under an empty called `Name`, which takes the mesh's place under its parent. Static meshes only:
  it refuses a skinned mesh. Unity builds the LOD Group from those names. Godot generates LODs at
  import (Generate LODs). Unreal documents "Import LODs", all LODs sharing one pivot. The group
  exports as a plain FBX Null, and Unreal's import of it is unmeasured.
- `bxe.collision(obj, engine, shape)` adds a collision mesh named for the importer:
  - Unreal: `UCX_Name_00` (convex hull) or `UBX_Name_00` (box), exported in the same FBX.
  - Godot: `Name-convcolonly` for `convex` (one hull) and `box` (the bounds, a box collider), or
    `Name-colonly` for `mesh` (the mesh as a trimesh, static bodies only).
  - Unity and Roblox: returns None. Colliders are set in the editor.
- Decimation can wreck UV seams and silhouettes. Review every LOD with `bx_review` before export.

## Batch conversion

```bash
blender -b --factory-startup --python-exit-code 1 -P bx_export.py -- \
        --batch /abs/in /abs/out --preset godot --profile game
```

For every model in the folder (GLB, glTF, FBX, OBJ, USD, STL, PLY): import into an empty scene, run
the delivery gate, export with the preset, re-import and compare. It writes `/abs/out/report.json`
with each file's gate errors, size and round-trip differences. One failing file never stops the
folder: it gets a `failed` entry. Two inputs sharing a name keep their format in the output name
(`hero_fbx.glb`, `hero_glb.glb`). Open the report before calling the batch done.

## Worked example: a generated GLB to Unity and Godot

```python
import sys
sys.path.append("/abs/skills/scenario-blender-expert/scripts")
sys.path.append("/abs/skills/scenario-blender-export/scripts")
import bpy, bx_audit, bx_export as bxe

bpy.ops.wm.read_factory_settings(use_empty=True)
bpy.ops.import_scene.gltf(filepath="/abs/in/robot.glb")
parts = [o.name for o in bpy.context.scene.objects if o.type == "MESH"]
gate = bx_audit.deliverable(parts, profile="game")
print(gate["errors"])            # fix each one, then gate again until "pass" is True

bxe.export("/abs/out/robot.fbx", "unity", parts)
print(bxe.round_trip("/abs/out/robot.fbx", parts, preset="unity")["diffs"])   # []
bxe.export("/abs/out/robot.glb", "godot", parts)
print(bxe.glb_summary("/abs/out/robot.glb")["extensions_required"])            # []
```

A generated GLB often holds one object per part, all sharing the asset's pivot. Keep them as
separate objects when the engine should animate or swap parts. Join them (`bpy.ops.object.join` with
the parts selected) for a single static prop, then gate again.

## Common mistakes

- Calling an export done on `FINISHED`. The exporter succeeds on files the engine imports at 100x
  scale or without the skin.
- Exporting a skinned mesh without its armature, or the armature without its mesh.
- Setting Bake Axis Conversion or Apply Transform to remove the armature node's rotation: neither
  removes it, and the first turns the character around.
- The `web` preset for Godot, or any compressed GLB for a loader without its decoder. Check
  `extensions_required` first.
- FBX textures left as external paths: the presets copy and embed them (`path_mode="COPY"`,
  `embed_textures=True`), so the file travels alone. `export()` gives packed images without an
  extension (as a GLB import leaves them) a `.jpg` or `.png` name first. An image never saved (a new
  bake target) or edited since travels as a packed copy of its pixels (`packed_unsaved_images`).
- A textured FBX that shows untextured in Unity: the default import keeps embedded textures inside
  the file. Extract Textures (Materials tab) into the model's folder assigns them.
- An STL at Blender scale: a 10 cm part prints at 0.1 mm.
- LODs exported without a look: decimation can collapse thin parts.
