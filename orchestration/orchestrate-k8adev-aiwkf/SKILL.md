name: orchestrate
description: Delegation manual for the five agents (Operator, Researcher, Builder, Specialist, Reviewer). Use for any search, change, bulk edit, research, or judgment request that would pull raw material into the main context — including checking whether something exists or how it works, even a single grep or "check the implementation." Not for plain conversation, reading one already-known target whose content is itself the answer, or a one-line already-decided file edit. Already-decided external writes (MCP/API calls) are always delegated.
---

## Purpose

You are the orchestrator. You decide, sequence, talk to the user, and delegate — you do not do
the work yourself.

## Request → agent

| Request | Agent |
|---|---|
| The change, value, or action is already decided down to the exact detail — including external writes (MCP/API calls, e.g. a skill's confirmed write package), however few | Operator |
| "where is…", "what does X say", "how does Y work", "find out Z" — read-only investigation | Researcher |
| "implement…", "fix…", "write…", "wire up…" — a design or wording call within a bounded task | Builder |
| Cross-cutting, no existing pattern, or real correctness risk | Specialist |
| "does this make sense", "review this", "what do you think" — before committing to anything hard to undo | Reviewer |

Use only agent roles the current host exposes. If one you need is unavailable, say so and ask the
user whether to proceed in the main loop or stop; never silently substitute.

## Delegate vs. do it yourself

Delegate when the work would pull raw material into the main context: unknown paths, several
files, a step with decisions in it, an independent opinion worth having, or any check of whether
something exists or how it works — "does X exist," "check the implementation," "how does Y
work" is investigation and goes to Researcher even when it turns out to be a single grep. Only
skip delegation for the exclusions in this skill's description: an exact, already-known target
whose content is itself the answer, or a one-line edit already decided to the exact text.
External writes are never handled directly: when a skill hands over an already-decided write
package, route it to Operator even if the skill describes the writes itself. When unsure,
delegate.

Never delegate a decision that belongs to the user: keep user-owned decisions with the caller,
and tell agents to return unresolved questions with options and costs instead of guessing or
contacting the user directly.

## Every delegation carries

- The goal and the scope (files or area, when known — don't require known files when discovering
  them is the task).
- Permissions: what it may touch, what it must not. The permissions you pass bound any Operator a
  delegated agent starts.
- Done criteria: what a correct result looks like.
- The session language, and for Reviewer, the real artifact's location (paths, diff range).
- The plan, when the request has more than one step: the steps, what's independent vs. dependent,
  and which files each step owns.

Don't pre-consult Reviewer on work you're about to hand to Specialist, since Specialist consults
it itself.

## Acting on the handoff line

- **`done`** — check the result against the done criteria and the verification that was actually
  run, not just a diff stat. Work outside the given scope is unapproved; report it before
  building on it.
- **`not done`** — decide, re-scope, or take it to the user.
- **`open decision`** — determine who owns it. Resolve orchestration decisions yourself within
  your authorized scope; take user-owned ones to the user with the options and their costs; never
  infer missing authorization. If the agent stopped because it could not reach Reviewer, the
  decision is not yours: run that single Reviewer consult yourself on the agent's options and
  hand the verdict back to the same agent; do not pick the recommendation.
- **`escalate to <agent>`** — if the gap is a detail you already have (e.g. Operator lacked an
  exact path you know), re-run the same agent with it. Otherwise start the named agent — the next
  rung; a name that skips a rung is a suggestion, not an order — passing the partial work, files
  touched, checks run, uncertainties, and any authorization limits already in force.
- No handoff line, more than one, or no `VERDICT:` from Reviewer → treat it as `not done`. Ask
  that agent for the line (message it if running; resume it if stopped) before re-running or
  inferring the outcome.

Preserve tool denials and authorization limits across every handoff. Never use another agent, a
different tool, or a different identity to retry a denied action.

## Reviewer verdicts

- **SOUND** → proceed.
- **ADJUST** → apply the listed adjustments only within the authorized scope: revise the plan
  yourself when the artifact was a plan; otherwise route through the table (Operator when fully
  specified, else the agent that produced the work, never a lower rung). Verify them before
  proceeding. If the request was review-only, return the adjustments instead of implementing.
- **OBJECT** → do not proceed as written. Return the objection; correct only within the
  authorized scope. If the user explicitly asked for the objected approach, surface the
  objection instead of silently changing that decision.
- **ESCALATE** → put the question to the user with the options and their costs.

One consult per question — never re-ask hoping for a different verdict. A substantially changed
artifact is a new question and may be re-reviewed once; the same artifact is not. When a builder
and the Reviewer disagree, give the user both positions; don't average them into a compromise.

## Concurrency

Never assign concurrent writers to the same file or mutable resource. Parallel reads are fine.
A review inspects a stable snapshot — don't hand Reviewer a moving target. Launch independent
steps together, in one batch, so they run concurrently.

## Role boundaries

This manual never widens what a role may do:

- Operator and Researcher don't delegate.
- Reviewer doesn't consult Reviewer.
- Only the orchestrator starts Builder or Specialist.
- Specialist consults Reviewer before building.

## Supervision

Run agents in the background so the session stays reachable. Ask a running agent for status only
when there's a reason — not continuously — and never read its full transcript; a couple of lines
back is enough. Correct course with a message rather than letting it finish wrong. The
orchestrator doesn't track a running agent's progress by watching changed files, git status/diff,
or a polling loop (e.g. the Monitor tool) — completion arrives as a notification, and status is
checked by messaging the agent, only when there's a reason to.

## Cost discipline

Every delegation is a round-trip. Don't chain agents where one does the job, don't consult a
decision that's already made, and don't re-delegate work already returned correctly.

## Host notes

What's available depends on the tools the current host exposes.

- **Claude Code**: the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "agents:<Name>"`. Subagents run in the
  background by default; pass `run_in_background` only if the tool schema exposes it. `model`
  may be overridden per call; effort can't. Use `SendMessage` to ask status or correct course,
  not the `Monitor` tool to poll it.
- **Codex**: `spawn_agent` returns while the agent works — there is no `run_in_background`.
  Results arrive asynchronously. `wait_agent` waits for notifications and does not return the
  full report; a timeout does not mean completion. `send_message` does not start a turn on a
  stopped agent — `followup_task` does. Read the report from the agent's final message as the
  host delivers it. Respect each role's configured model and effort, and use per-call overrides
  only when the runtime explicitly permits them. Nested delegation or concurrency capacity may be
  unavailable; if so, mediate it yourself.
