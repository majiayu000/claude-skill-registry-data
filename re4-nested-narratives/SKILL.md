# RE4 Nested Narratives

Apply the RE4 Nested Narratives transformation to structure information as stories within stories for depth and memorability.

## What is RE4?

**RE4 (Nested Narratives)** Structure information as stories within stories for depth and memorability.

## When to Use RE4

### Ideal Situations
- Iterate toward a better solution using feedback loops
- Refine a process through repeated cycles
- Scale a pattern through repetition and standardization

### Trigger Questions
- "How can we use Nested Narratives here?"
- "What changes if we apply RE4 to this iterating a workflow over several cycles?"
- "Which assumptions does RE4 help us surface?"

## The RE4 Process

### Step 1: Define the focus
```typescript
// Using RE4 (Nested Narratives) - Establish the focus
const focus = "Structure information as stories within stories for depth and memorability";
```

### Step 2: Apply the model
```typescript
// Using RE4 (Nested Narratives) - Apply the transformation
const output = applyModel("RE4", focus);
```

### Step 3: Synthesize outcomes
```typescript
// Using RE4 (Nested Narratives) - Capture insights and decisions
const insights = summarize(output);
```

## Practical Example

```typescript
// Using RE4 (Nested Narratives) - Example in a iterating a workflow over several cycles
const result = applyModel("RE4", "Structure information as stories within stories for depth and memorability" );
```

## Integration with Other Transformations

- **RE4 -> CO5**: Pair with CO5 when sequencing matters.
- **RE4 -> SY8**: Use SY8 to validate or stress-test.
- **RE4 -> IN3**: Apply IN3 to compose the output.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify the context that requires RE4
- [ ] Apply the model using explicit RE4 references
- [ ] Document assumptions and outputs
- [ ] Confirm alignment with stakeholders or owners

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating the model as a checklist instead of a lens
- Skipping documentation of assumptions or rationale
- Over-applying the model without validating impact

## Best Practices

- Use explicit RE4 references in comments and docs
- Keep the output focused and actionable
- Combine with adjacent transformations when needed

## Measurement and Success

- Clearer decisions and fewer unresolved assumptions
- Faster alignment across stakeholders
- Reusable artifacts for future iterations

## Installation and Usage

### Nix Installation
```nix
{
  programs.moltbot.plugins = [
    { source = "github:hummbl-dev/hummbl-agent?dir=skills/RE-recursion/re4-nested-narratives"; }
  ];
}
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
moltbot-registry install hummbl-agent/re4-nested-narratives
```

### Usage with Commands
```bash
/apply-transformation RE4 "Structure information as stories within stories for depth and memorability"
```
