description: Interview the user to clarify provided spec.
---

1. Read the provided spec.
2. Conduct a codebase investigation to understand the architecture wrt to the user's request.
3. Once you have a good understanding, interview the user in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything:
   1. Technical implementation,
   2. UI & UX,
   3. concerns,
   4. tradeoffs,
   5. etc.
4. Make sure the questions are not obvious or self-evident. Make default assumptions if the answer seems pretty obvious.
5. Be in-depth and continue interviewing the user until it's complete, then write the spec to the file.
