# Spatial Thinking

Think like a sculptor working in time. Your characters exist in three-dimensional space, even on a 2D screen. Every frame is a frozen moment in a world with depth.

## Core Mental Model

Before animating anything, ask: **Where is this in 3D space, and how does it move through that space?**

Animation is 4D: three spatial dimensions plus time. Characters have fronts and backs. Rooms have depth. Actions travel along vectors through real (imagined) environments.

## The 12 Principles Through Dimension

**Solid Drawing** — The foundation of spatial thinking. Every object has volume. Turn it around in your mind. Know what the back looks like. Draw through forms, not around them.

**Arcs** — All movement happens in 3D space. An arm swinging traces a curve through depth, not just across the screen. Think spherical paths, not flat shapes.

**Staging** — Spatial composition. Where in the Z-axis is each element? Foreground, midground, background create depth. Overlap establishes position in space.

**Squash & Stretch** — Deformation happens in 3D. When a ball squashes, it spreads outward in all directions, not just sideways. Maintain volume in depth.

**Anticipation** — Movement into the screen reads differently than across it. Anticipation toward camera: foreshortening increases. Away: forms recede.

**Follow Through & Overlapping Action** — Trailing elements exist in 3D. Hair doesn't just swing left-right; it wraps around forms, falls with gravity, catches on shoulders.

**Secondary Action** — Supporting elements occupy their own spatial positions. A cape occupies the space behind a character. Spatial consistency sells reality.

**Timing** — Depth affects perceived timing. Objects moving toward/away from camera have different visual rhythms than horizontal movement. Foreshortening compresses distance.

**Slow In & Slow Out** — Acceleration reads differently in depth. Objects approaching camera grow rapidly at the end (looming effect). Factor Z-axis speed changes.

**Exaggeration** — Spatial exaggeration includes depth. Characters can lean impossibly far into frame. Environments can stretch beyond physical possibility while maintaining spatial logic.

**Appeal** — Dynamic spatial composition is appealing. Interesting angles, depth variation, and dimensional poses create visual interest.

**Straight Ahead & Pose to Pose** — 3D motion paths are easier to plan (pose to pose). Complex spatial action benefits from knowing key positions in space before animating between them.

## Practical Application

**Spatial Awareness Checklist:**
- [ ] Where is the floor? Characters need grounding.
- [ ] Where is the light source? It defines form.
- [ ] What overlaps what? Establish depth order.
- [ ] What's the camera angle? Affects all foreshortening.
- [ ] What exists off-screen? Implied space matters.

**Common Spatial Errors:**
- Floating: Characters not connected to environment
- Flattening: Losing depth in complex poses
- Scale drift: Objects changing size unintentionally
- Tangents: Edges aligning in ways that flatten depth
- Perspective inconsistency: Elements not sharing the same spatial grid

When animation feels "flat":
1. Add overlapping elements to establish depth
2. Include Z-axis movement (toward/away from camera)
3. Use perspective in posing (near hand bigger than far hand)
4. Add environmental shadows grounding characters

When space feels "confusing":
1. Simplify depth layers
2. Establish clear foreground/background separation
3. Use staging to clarify spatial relationships
4. Add establishing shots before complex action

**Thinking in Depth:**
- Turn poses 45 degrees in your mind
- Imagine the camera orbiting your scene
- Consider what's behind every surface
- Track objects through continuous 3D paths

## The Golden Rule

**The screen is a window, not a canvas.** You're not decorating a flat surface—you're revealing a world that extends in all directions. Every element occupies a position in that world. Honor the space.
