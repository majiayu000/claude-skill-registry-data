  description: Creating interactive data visualisations using d3.js. This skill should
  be used when creating custom charts, graphs, network diagrams, geographic visualisations,
  or any complex SVG-based data visualisation that requires fine-grained control over
  visual elements, transitions, or interactions. Use this for bespoke visualisations
  beyond standard charting libraries, whether in React, Vue, Svelte, vanilla JavaScript,
  or any other environment.

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with excellent
      specificity on when to use d3.js versus alternatives. It provides concrete code
      patterns and workflow guidance, though it could benefit from more explicit edge
      case handling (e.g., responsive design, performance optimization for large datasets).
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world development, offering immediate
      value through actionable code patterns for both vanilla JS and framework integration.
      It comprehensively covers the core workflow from setup to implementation, making
      it immediately beneficial for developers creating custom visualizations.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill prompt that provides comprehensive
    guidance for d3.js visualization development with clear patterns, practical examples,
    and appropriate framework-agnostic advice.
