# Community Insight Taxonomy Skill

## When to Use
- Standardizing feedback tagging across forums, events, surveys, and interviews.
- Sharing structured insights with product, marketing, or CS teams.
- Powering dashboards and AI routing for community signals.

## Framework
1. **Persona Dimension** – builders, admins, execs, partners, champions, newcomers.
2. **Journey Stage** – onboarding, activation, adoption, expansion, advocacy, lapse.
3. **Driver Dimension** – product, support, education, pricing, community experience, roadmap.
4. **Sentiment & Urgency** – positive/neutral/negative + severity/impact.
5. **Business Linkage** – map to ARR tier, account health, opportunity pipeline, or churn risk.

## Templates
- Tag dictionary with definitions, examples, and confidence guidelines.
- Airtable/Sheet schema with validation + automation hooks.
- Quick-reference cheatsheet for moderators/interviewers.

## Tips
- Run monthly taxonomy reviews to merge duplicates and add emerging themes.
- Capture "what good looks like" examples to maintain consistency.
- Pair with `run-member-insight-sprint` for auto-tagged datasets.
