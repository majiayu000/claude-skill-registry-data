# Social Calendar Governance Skill

## When to Use
- Building or auditing cross-network publishing schedules.
- Coordinating regional calendars or blackout dates (events, outages, compliance windows).
- Running retros after missed posts or conflicting campaigns.

## Framework
1. **Cadence Rules** – define min/max posts per channel/day, quiet hours, and pacing relative to paid media.
2. **Coverage & Localization** – ensure global timezones, languages, and partner regions have representation.
3. **Dependency Checks** – align with product launches, events, newsletters, or PR activity to avoid clashes.
4. **Approval Milestones** – map review deadlines backwards from publish times; include contingency buffers.
5. **Audit & Change Control** – maintain version history, note last-minute overrides, and capture rationale.

## Templates
- Calendar governance checklist (cadence, blackout, approvals, localization, dependencies).
- Timezone coverage heatmap (channel × region × daypart).
- Change-log template for late edits or cancellations.

## Tips
- Publish a weekly "calendar health" snapshot for stakeholders.
- Pair with automation scripts that flag double-bookings or empty slots.
- Store governance docs alongside calendars for auditability.
