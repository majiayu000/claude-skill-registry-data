Invoke the superpowers:writing-skills skill when creating new skills, editing existing skills, or verifying skills work before deployment.

Use this to apply TDD to process documentation by testing with subagents before writing, iterating until bulletproof.

```
Skill("superpowers:writing-skills")
```
