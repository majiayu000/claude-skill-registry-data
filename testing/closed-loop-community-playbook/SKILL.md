# Closed-Loop Community Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- After capturing member insights or escalations that require action.
- Coordinating follow-up between community, product, CS, and marketing teams.
- Demonstrating accountability to members via updates and celebrations.

## Framework
1. **Intake & Qualification** – log insight ID, theme, severity, evidence, member metadata.
2. **Routing** – assign accountable owner, squad, and due date with SLA tiers.
3. **Action Plan** – outline fix/enhancement, dependencies, success metrics, and comms plan.
4. **Member Comms** – draft acknowledgement, progress updates, and completion announcements.
5. **Retrospective** – record outcomes, lessons, and new opportunities.

## Templates
- Insight/action tracker with columns for owners, stage, and communication status.
- Member update email/DM templates for acknowledgment, progress, completion.
- Quarterly accountability report summarizing closed-loop wins.

## Tips
- Tag insights by member cohorts to personalize updates.
- Celebrate shipped improvements publicly to reinforce participation value.
- Pair with `run-member-insight-sprint` so every campaign produces accountable actions.
