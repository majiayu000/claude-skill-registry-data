# Channel Integration Skill

## When to Use
- Running campaigns that span email, social, paid media, events, web, PR.
- Need to prevent message fatigue or conflicting offers.
- Ensuring consistent tracking/UTM taxonomy across channels.

## Framework
1. **Messaging Matrix** – align offer, CTA, creative angle per channel/persona.
2. **Cadence Alignment** – stagger sends/posts to avoid overlap; define quiet periods.
3. **Asset Repository** – maintain single source of truth for approved copy/creative.
4. **Tracking Consistency** – standardize UTMs, naming conventions, analytics tags.
5. **Feedback Loop** – daily standup with channel owners to share insights/risks.
6. **Escalation Path** – define who can approve changes when conflicts arise.

## Templates
- Channel calendar template (email, paid, social, events, partner).
- UTM builder/validation sheet.
- Real-time channel status dashboard (Ready, QA, Live, Blocked).
- Message/source-of-truth sheet mapping audience × channel × CTA.

## Tips
- Use a common taxonomy for statuses (Draft, QA, Scheduled, Live) so every team reads the board the same way.
- Hold 15-minute syncs during peak launch weeks, async updates otherwise.
- Automate delivery of performance snapshots back to planners so adjustments happen fast.
- Designate a single owner for conflict resolution to avoid channel tug-of-war.
