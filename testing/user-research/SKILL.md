# User Research - User Understanding Guide

Design research approaches that reveal what users actually need, do, and experience. Move from assumptions to evidence about your users.

## Start Here

**New to research?** Read [workflow/research-planning.md](./workflow/research-planning.md) first.

**Know what you need?** Read [workflow/phase-selection.md](./workflow/phase-selection.md) to find the right technique.

## Quick Phase Reference

| Phase | When | Techniques |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Discovery** | Don't know enough about users | Interviews, Journey Maps, Card Sorting |
| **Validation** | Testing if solution works | Prototypes, Usability, Surveys |
| **Design** | Shaping the output | Critique, Story Maps, Requirements |
| **Compliance** | Meeting standards | Accessibility Audit |

**Default**: Start with Discovery interviews, use Validation surveys for scale.

## Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal**: Understand users deeply before building anything.

Use Discovery when you don't know what users actually need, or need to understand the problem before solving it.

| Technique | Best For | Read |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Interview Design** | Deep motivations, context, "why" | [cookbook/discovery/interview-design.md](./cookbook/discovery/interview-design.md) |
| **Journey Mapping** | End-to-end experience, pain points | [cookbook/discovery/journey-mapping.md](./cookbook/discovery/journey-mapping.md) |
| **Card Sorting** | User mental models, information architecture | [cookbook/discovery/card-sorting.md](./cookbook/discovery/card-sorting.md) |

**Triggers**: "understand users", "what do they need", "pain points", "problem space", "discovery"

## Phase 2: Validation

**Goal**: Test whether your solution works for users.

Use Validation when you have a design or prototype and need evidence that it works.

| Technique | Best For | Read |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Prototype Feedback** | Early concepts, interaction design | [cookbook/validation/prototype-feedback.md](./cookbook/validation/prototype-feedback.md) |
| **Usability Testing** | Task completion, real product | [cookbook/validation/usability-testing.md](./cookbook/validation/usability-testing.md) |
| **Survey Design** | Quantitative data at scale | [cookbook/validation/survey-design.md](./cookbook/validation/survey-design.md) |

**Triggers**: "test this design", "will it work", "validate", "feedback", "measure"

## Phase 3: Design Support

**Goal**: Shape output with research-informed decisions.

Use Design Support when evaluating options, prioritizing features, or documenting constraints.

| Technique | Best For | Read |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Design Critique** | Structured design feedback | [cookbook/design/design-critique.md](./cookbook/design/design-critique.md) |
| **User Story Mapping** | Feature prioritization, MVP definition | [cookbook/design/user-story-mapping.md](./cookbook/design/user-story-mapping.md) |
| **Requirements Gathering** | Constraints, trade-offs, specs | [cookbook/design/requirements-gathering.md](./cookbook/design/requirements-gathering.md) |

**Triggers**: "prioritize features", "what to build", "requirements", "critique", "constraints"

## Phase 4: Compliance

**Goal**: Ensure the product meets standards.

Use Compliance when preparing for launch or ensuring inclusive access.

| Technique | Best For | Read |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **Accessibility Audit** | WCAG compliance, inclusive design | [cookbook/compliance/accessibility-audit.md](./cookbook/compliance/accessibility-audit.md) |

**Triggers**: "accessibility", "WCAG", "inclusive", "a11y", "compliance"

## Core Principles

1. **Observe behavior, not just words** - What people do often differs from what they say
2. **Ask "why" and "show me"** - Surface explanations hide deeper truths
3. **Recruit the right users** - Wrong participants = wrong insights
4. **Separate research from validation** - Don't seek confirmation of your ideas
5. **Document and share** - Insights locked in your head don't help the team

## When User Research Works Best

- Building something new (discovery)
- Existing product isn't performing (diagnosis)
- Prioritizing features (evidence-based decisions)
- Resolving internal debates (let users decide)
- Before major investment (de-risk)

## The Research Mindset

- **Curiosity over confirmation**: Seek to learn, not to prove
- **Empathy over judgment**: Understand their world, don't evaluate it
- **Patterns over anecdotes**: One user's opinion isn't data
- **Action over analysis**: Research should drive decisions
