# Skill: Debug E2E Test

> **Browser tooling — works for both toolsets.** Use whichever is configured:
> Playwright MCP (`mcp_playwright_browser_*`) for Claude, or the Copilot browser
> tools (`open_browser_page`, `read_page`, `screenshot_page`, `click_element`) for
> VS Code Copilot. Where this skill says "Playwright MCP", use the equivalent tool
> from whichever set is available.

Systematic workflow for debugging and fixing failing Playwright E2E tests.

## When to Use

- A Playwright E2E test is failing
- Asked to fix a failing test
- Investigating why tests are broken
- Tests pass locally but fail in CI

## Debugging Workflow

### Step 1: Run the Specific Failed Test

Run ONLY the specific failing test:

```bash
npx playwright test <test-file>.spec.ts -g "test name"
```

### Step 2: Analyze the Test Output

Extract from terminal output:
1. **Test location**: File path and line number
2. **Failure type**: What assertion failed
3. **Expected vs Actual**: What the test expected vs what it got
4. **Error message**: The specific error
5. **Artifact paths**: Screenshot and error-context locations

### Step 3: Load the Screenshot

Use the screenshot from test results to see the visual state at failure time.

### Step 4: Read the Error Context

Read any `error-context.md` file from test results:
- DOM snapshot
- Console logs
- Network errors

### Step 5: Read the Test Code

Understand what the test is trying to do, what selectors it uses, and what assertions it makes.

### Step 6: Compare Test Expectations with Implementation

```bash
grep -r "text the test looks for" src/ --include="*.tsx"
```

Check: routes, text content, element types, selectors.

### Step 7: Use the browser tools (If Needed)

If artifacts don't reveal the issue:
1. Navigate to the page
2. Take a screenshot
3. Get visible HTML
4. Interact with elements
5. Inspect behavior

### Step 8: Fix the Issue

Fix the test, the code, or both.

### Step 9: Verify the Fix

```bash
npx playwright test <test-file>.spec.ts -g "test name"
```

## Intermittent Failures — Non-Deterministic Data

If tests pass sometimes and fail other times:

### Common Causes
1. Sample generators using `Date.now()` or `new Date()`
2. Missing seeds in mock handlers
3. Stories without seeds

### How to Diagnose
```bash
npx playwright test <file>.spec.ts -g "test name"
npx playwright test <file>.spec.ts -g "test name"
# If results differ, you have non-deterministic data
```

### How to Fix
1. Update sample generators to use seeds
2. Add seeds everywhere — never call sample functions without seeds

## Tips
1. Always run the single test first
2. Start with artifacts — screenshot + error-context tell you 90% of issues
3. Use MCP sparingly
4. Check obvious things first — routes, text, element types
5. One test at a time
