# Meta Title & Description Optimizer

## Purpose
Generate meta titles and descriptions that maximize click-through rates (CTR) while following NextStep Therapy's established formula and maintaining CRPO compliance.

## When to Use This Skill
- User mentions "meta title" or "meta description"
- User asks to "optimize for CTR" or "improve click-through rate"
- User provides a page URL for SEO optimization
- User asks "how can I rank better" or "improve SERP performance"
- User mentions specific therapy pages needing optimization

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Gather Input
Ask user for:
1. **Target keyword** (e.g., "anxiety therapy ontario")
2. **Page content** or URL
3. **Current meta title/description** (if exists)
4. **Target audience** (students, professionals, general)

### Step 2: Generate Title Variations
Create 5 title variations following the formula:
```
[Service] + [Location] | [Differentiator] | NextStep Therapy
```

**Key Rules:**
- Maximum 60 characters (50-60 is optimal)
- Front-load primary keyword
- Include ONE differentiator per title
- Avoid "CBT" or "ACT" unless keyword research explicitly supports it
- Use positive sentiment (4.1% higher CTR than negative)
- Keep to 6-10 words maximum

**CRPO Compliance:**
- ✅ Must be factual and verifiable
- ✅ No exaggerated claims or guarantees
- ✅ No misleading statements
- ❌ Never promise specific outcomes
- ❌ Never claim to be "best" or "top" without proof

### Step 3: Score Each Variation
Score each title (0-100) based on:
1. **Keyword placement** (0-25 points)
   - Front-loaded: 25 points
   - Middle: 15 points
   - End: 5 points

2. **Length optimization** (0-25 points)
   - 50-60 chars: 25 points
   - 45-49 or 61-65 chars: 15 points
   - Under 45 or over 65: 5 points

3. **Emotional appeal** (0-25 points)
   - Positive, empathetic tone: 25 points
   - Neutral: 15 points
   - Negative or clinical: 5 points

4. **Differentiation** (0-25 points)
   - Clear unique value: 25 points
   - Moderate differentiation: 15 points
   - Generic: 5 points

**Total Score:**
- 90-100: Excellent CTR potential
- 75-89: Good CTR potential
- 60-74: Fair CTR potential
- Below 60: Needs improvement

### Step 4: Generate Meta Descriptions
For the top 2-3 title variations, create matching meta descriptions:

**Rules:**
- 150-155 characters (maximum 160)
- Expand on the value proposition
- Include call-to-action
- Mention CRPO registration
- Use natural, empathetic language
- Front-load important information

**Example Structure:**
```
[Benefit statement]. [Social proof/credential]. [Call-to-action]. Same-week appointments available.
```

### Step 5: SERP Preview Simulation
Generate a visual SERP preview for each variation:
```
Title Here (60 chars max)
https://nextsteptherapy.ca/page-slug
Meta description here explaining the value proposition and including
CRPO credentials. Call-to-action at the end.
```

### Step 6: Recommend Top Choice
Present the highest-scoring variation with reasoning:
- Why this variation will perform best
- Specific CTR improvement estimate (based on benchmarks)
- Any A/B testing recommendations

## Differentiators Library

Use ONE per title (rotate for variety):

**Service-Based:**
- "Same-Week Virtual Sessions"
- "Evening & Weekend Appointments"
- "ACT Therapy Specialist"
- "CRPO Registered Therapist"

**Location-Based:**
- "Serving [City] & Ontario"
- "Virtual Therapy Across Ontario"
- "Ontario-Based Therapist"

**Outcome-Focused (must be factual):**
- "Evidence-Based Treatment"
- "Specialized Support"
- "Professional Guidance"

**NEVER USE** (CRPO violations):
- "Best therapist"
- "Guaranteed results"
- "Cure anxiety/depression"
- "Most experienced"
- "Top-rated" (without verifiable proof)

## Error Handling

**If keyword is too long:**
"The keyword '[keyword]' is [X] characters, which makes it difficult to fit in a 60-character title. Consider targeting a shorter variation or using a partial match."

**If no clear differentiator:**
"I don't see a clear differentiator in your page content. NextStep's unique selling points are: CRPO #10979, ACT specialization, same-week availability, evening/weekend appointments. Which should I emphasize?"

**If claims seem exaggerated:**
"Warning: The phrase '[phrase]' may violate CRPO advertising standards. Claims must be factual and verifiable. I'll revise to a compliant alternative."
