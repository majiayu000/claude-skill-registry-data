name: makefile
description: Use when creating or updating a Makefile for a project, especially when standard targets (build, test, lint, format, etc.) are missing or when modifying targets that may already be wired into other tooling. Not for debugging why a build fails.

**On invocation:** announce "Running paad:makefile v1.31.0" before anything else.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **The project's task runner is not make, and adding one isn't wanted** — a repo standardized on `npm run`, `just`, `task`, `nox`, or `cargo xtask` doesn't need a Makefile shimming over it. Ask before introducing a second entry point.
- **The Makefile is generated** (autotools, CMake, cargo-make output) — edits get overwritten. Change the generator.

## Overview

Creates or updates a project Makefile with standard targets. **Never modifies an existing target without explicit user approval.**

## Process

1. Detect stack (read CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README, package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.)
2. Check if Makefile exists
3. Creating → build from scratch with all required targets mapped to detected stack
4. Updating → add missing targets; STOP and ask before changing any existing one
5. Announce the file you wrote — see "Announce What You Wrote"

## Stack Detection

Read project files in this order to understand the technology and available commands:

1. `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` — often lists exact commands for test, lint, format, build
2. `README.md` — frequently documents dev workflow
3. Language manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `Gemfile`, etc.) — reveals available scripts/tasks

**Use the commands the project already documents.** Do not invent commands that aren't confirmed to exist.

## Required Targets

Every Makefile must include at minimum:

| Target   | Purpose                            |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| `help`   | List all targets with descriptions |
| `all`    | Full CI pass (lint + format + test at minimum) |
| `test`   | Run test suite                     |
| `cover`  | One-shot coverage report           |
| `lint`   | Lint (with autofix if available)   |
| `format` | Format code                        |

Add extra targets (e.g. `build`, `dev`, `preview`) only if the project supports them.

## The Self-Documenting Pattern

Every target gets a `##` description. `help` extracts them with `grep` + `awk`:

```makefile
.PHONY: all test cover lint format help

all: lint format test ## Lint, format, and test

test: ## Run full test suite
	<stack-specific command>

cover: ## Generate code coverage report (one-shot)
	<stack-specific command, forced one-shot — see below>

lint: ## Lint with autofix
	<stack-specific command>

format: ## Format code
	<stack-specific command>

help: ## Show this help
	@grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "  %-10s %s\n", $$1, $$2}'
```

All targets must appear in `.PHONY`.

## Critical Rule: Updating Existing Targets

If an existing target's implementation would change, **stop and tell the user**:

> "The existing `cover` target runs `X`. I'd change it to `Y` because [reason]. Should I make this change?"

Wait for explicit approval. Adding a brand-new target never requires approval.

## cover: Avoid Watch Mode Hanging

Coverage tools often default to watch mode. Force one-shot execution:

- **vitest:** append `-- --run`
- **jest:** append `-- --watchAll=false`
- **pytest-cov / cargo / go test:** typically exit on their own; verify before adding flags
- **other:** check the tool's docs for a non-interactive/CI flag

## test: Balanced Output Verbosity

`make test` output should be **actionable, not overwhelming**. Avoid both extremes:

- **Too verbose:** full test names for passing tests, stack traces for every assertion, watch-mode chatter
- **Too silent:** a single pass/fail line with no detail on failures

**Goal:** On success, show a concise summary (total passed/failed/skipped). On failure, show the failing test name, assertion, and enough context to act on it.

Common approaches by stack:

| Stack | Flag / Approach |
|-------|-----------------|
| **vitest** | `--reporter=default` is usually fine; avoid `--reporter=verbose` |
| **jest** | Default is good; avoid `--verbose` |
| **pytest** | `-q` or `--tb=short` — default is often too verbose |
| **cargo test** | Default is fine; `--quiet` if too noisy |
| **go test** | Default is fine; avoid `-v` unless debugging |
| **prove (Perl)** | Default is fine; avoid `--verbose` |

**If the testing tool doesn't support balanced output** (e.g., only offers silent vs. firehose), inform the user and ask how they'd like to handle it rather than guessing.

## Announce What You Wrote

End the run with the file list, always. One line per path, marked new or updated:

```
Files written or updated:
  updated  Makefile
```

Say it even though only one file changed, and even when the user watched you change it. If you were asked to change an existing target and stopped for approval instead, say that too — an unapproved target is not a written one.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | What to do instead |
|---------|-------------------|
| Rewriting an existing target because the new version is better | Stop and ask, quoting the current command and the proposed one. Other tooling (CI, hooks, docs, muscle memory) may depend on the current behaviour. |
| Treating "add a flag to an existing target" as additive | Changing a target's implementation is a change, flag or not. It needs approval. |
| Inventing commands the stack doesn't have | Detect first — read CLAUDE.md, README, and the language manifest. A `lint` target running a linter that isn't installed is worse than no target. |
| Writing a `help` target that lists targets by hand | Use the self-documenting `##` pattern, so help can't drift from reality. |
| Leaving `cover` in watch mode | It hangs the agent and CI. Force one-shot explicitly, per the stack. |
| Omitting targets from `.PHONY` | A file named `test` in the repo root silently breaks `make test`. |
| Adding every optional target for completeness | Extra targets (`build`, `dev`, `preview`) go in only when the project actually supports them. |
