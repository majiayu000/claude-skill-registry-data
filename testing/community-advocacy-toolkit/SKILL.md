# Community Advocacy Toolkit Skill

## When to Use
- Launching referral programs, ambassador cohorts, or testimonial drives.
- Equipping community managers with repeatable advocacy motions.
- Capturing social proof for campaigns, admissions events, or partner pitches.

## Framework
1. **Advocate Segments** – active students, alumni, faculty champions, employer partners.
2. **Value Exchange** – define incentives (scholarships, swag, career access, recognition).
3. **Activation Motions** – events, content spotlights, referral challenges, mentorship.
4. **Governance** – guidelines, approval workflows, consent forms, brand usage.
5. **Measurement** – referral volume, content reach, influence on enrollment/retention.

## Templates
- Advocate profile + consent form.
- Campaign brief (goal, CTA, incentive, timeline, owner).
- Reporting sheet linking advocacy activities to KPIs.

## Tips
- Rotate spotlights to keep communities inclusive and authentic.
- Provide ready-to-use creative/toolkits so advocates can activate quickly.
- Pair with `design-curriculum-partnership` and `launch-student-success-program` deliverables.
