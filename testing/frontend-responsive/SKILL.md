# Frontend Responsive

## When to use this skill

- When implementing layouts that need to work on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes
- When using CSS media queries with standard breakpoints (mobile: 320-768px, tablet: 768-1024px, desktop: 1024px+)
- When applying responsive Tailwind classes like `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` modifiers
- When creating fluid layouts with percentage-based widths or CSS Grid/Flexbox that adapt to screen size
- When using relative units (`rem`, `em`) instead of fixed pixels for scalable, accessible sizing
- When designing mobile-first with progressive enhancement for larger screens
- When ensuring touch targets are at least 44x44px for mobile usability
- When optimizing images and assets for mobile network conditions and different screen densities
- When testing UI changes across multiple device sizes and verifying responsive behavior
- When maintaining readable font sizes across breakpoints without requiring user zoom
- When prioritizing content display on smaller screens (showing critical info first, hiding secondary content)
- When configuring viewport meta tags for proper mobile rendering
- When implementing responsive navigation patterns (hamburger menus, collapsible sections, drawer navigation)
