# Partner Integration Kit Skill

## When to Use
- Pursuits requiring multi-party delivery (automation, MES, IoT, safety systems).
- Onboarding new partners to co-sell or co-deliver solutions.
- Preparing integration readiness reviews or partner governance cadence.

## Framework
1. **Partner Matrix** – catalog roles (SI, OEM, distributor), competencies, certifications, territories.
2. **Integration Requirements** – data flows, protocols, safety/regulatory requirements, testing environments.
3. **Joint Value Narrative** – messaging pillars, proof points, and differentiation with partners.
4. **Enablement & Governance** – training plans, escalation matrix, release/change management.
5. **Performance Dashboard** – pipeline contribution, stage progression, delivery KPIs, CSAT.

## Templates
- Partner kickoff deck (roles, deliverables, SLAs).
- Integration readiness checklist (systems, documentation, test cases).
- Joint success plan with KPIs, review cadence, risk tracker.

## Tips
- Capture NDAs, data-sharing agreements, and export control docs in the same workspace.
- Provide sandbox/demo environments to speed partner validations.
- Pair with `build-technical-bid-plan` and `run-deal-health-review` outputs.
