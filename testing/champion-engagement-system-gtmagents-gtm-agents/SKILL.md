# Champion Engagement System Skill

## When to Use
- Building community advocacy programs (advisory circles, ambassador tracks, beta councils).
- Coordinating champion contributions to events, content, referrals, or product input.
- Monitoring engagement health and risk signals among top advocates.

## Framework
1. **Selection Criteria** – health scores, expertise, influence, diversity goals, legal clearance.
2. **Journey Mapping** – onboarding, activation milestones, recognition, renewal.
3. **Contribution Menu** – speaking, content creation, mentoring, betas, peer support.
4. **Incentives & Recognition** – swag, access, revenue share, spotlight campaigns.
5. **Measurement** – track contributions, influenced pipeline, retention, satisfaction.

## Templates
- **Champion Tiering**: See `references/champion_tiering.md` for levels and benefits.
- **Champion roster sheet** with scoring, status, and owner.
- **Program brief** (objectives, commitments, benefits, timeline).
- Recognition calendar + communication kit.

## Tips
