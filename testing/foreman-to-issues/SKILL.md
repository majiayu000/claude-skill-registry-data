description: Break an approved PRD into small, dependency-ordered, vertically-sliced implementation issues written as local files in the Foreman feature directory. Each issue ships a runnable acceptance check and a declared file footprint. No GitHub, no live quizzing of the user — emits files matching Foreman's issue schema with PRD traceability.

# foreman-to-issues

(Adapted from mattpocock/skills `to-issues` — see NOTICE. Removed: all `gh` CLI
usage, GitHub labels/triage vocabulary, and the interactive "quiz the user" loop.
Issues are emitted as local files; the human reviews them in Foreman's queue-review
screen instead.)

Break the **approved PRD** into independently-grabbable issues using vertical
slices (tracer bullets). Run headless: produce the files and stop. The human will
reorder/edit/delete/add in Foreman's queue-review screen — do not ask them
anything here.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Read the approved `prd.md` (path injected by Foreman) — its body, user stories,
and user flows. Read the approved `plan.md` and `adr.md` too for decisions.

### 2. Explore the codebase

Understand the current state so titles and descriptions use the project's domain
glossary (`CONTEXT.md`) and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the PRD into **tracer-bullet** issues. Each issue is a thin vertical slice
that cuts through ALL integration layers end-to-end (schema → logic → API → UI →
tests), NOT a horizontal slice of one layer.

<vertical-slice-rules>
- Each slice delivers a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer.
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own.
- Prefer many thin slices over few thick ones.
- Order slices by dependency: a slice that others build on comes first.
- Every slice traces back to one or more PRD sections / user stories.
</vertical-slice-rules>

### 4. Emit one file per slice

Write each slice to `.foreman/features/<slug>/issues/ISS-NNN.md`, numbered from
`001` in dependency order (blockers first, so `depends_on` can reference real
ids). Each file is YAML frontmatter + markdown body in **exactly** this schema:

```md
---
id: ISS-001
title: <short descriptive name>
status: queued
depends_on: []            # list of blocking issue ids, e.g. ["ISS-001"]
branch: feature/<slug>/iss-001
attempts: 0
budget: { max_turns: 80, max_cost_usd: 5.00, timeout_min: 45 }
prd_refs: ["PRD §<section>", "Story #<n>"]   # traceability back to the PRD
acceptance_check: tests/<area>/test_<slice>.py   # runnable check (REQUIRED)
touches: ["src/<area>/...", "tests/<area>/..."]  # declared file footprint
kind: feature
---
## Goal

A concise description of this vertical slice — the end-to-end behavior, not a
layer-by-layer implementation plan. Avoid file paths and code snippets (they go
stale); a prototype-derived decision snippet may be inlined if it encodes a
decision more precisely than prose.

## Acceptance criteria (testable)

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Out of scope

- What this slice deliberately does not do.
```

Rules:

- `id` is `ISS-` + zero-padded three-digit number, unique within the feature.
- `branch` is `feature/<slug>/iss-NNN` (lowercase).
- `budget` defaults come from the feature's config `run_budget`; only deviate when
  a slice is clearly bigger or smaller, and say why in the body if you do.
- `prd_refs` MUST be present and non-empty — every issue traces to the PRD.
- `depends_on` MUST be acyclic and reference only earlier issues.

### `acceptance_check` — the executable form of acceptance (REQUIRED)

Every issue MUST carry a runnable `acceptance_check` derived **directly from a PRD
acceptance criterion**, so "done" is executable, not prose. It is either:

- a **bare test-file path** (Foreman runs it with the project's test command),
  e.g. `acceptance_check: tests/todo/test_done.py`; or
- a **command** (more than one token), e.g.
  `acceptance_check: "pytest tests/todo/test_done.py::test_marks_complete"`.

If the check is a dedicated test the slice must add, write that test file into a
canonical `issues/ISS-NNN.check/` directory (same relative path it should have in
the repo, e.g. `issues/ISS-001.check/tests/todo/test_done.py`). Foreman re-installs
it into the worktree before verifying so the worker cannot weaken or delete it.
An issue with no `acceptance_check` is rejected from the queue.

### `touches` — the declared file footprint (for safe parallelism)

List the files/dirs/modules the slice will create or modify. Foreman builds a
conflict graph from these and never runs two overlapping issues concurrently, so
**maximise disjointness** when slicing — prefer slices whose footprints don't
overlap. An empty/unknown footprint is treated as conflicting with everything
(the safe default), which serialises the slice — so always declare it.

Do not create any external tickets. Do not modify the PRD.
