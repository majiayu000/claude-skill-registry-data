# OpenWebF App: Testing (Vitest + React Testing Library)

## Instructions

1. Identify the stack (React/Vue/etc.) and current test tooling (if any).
2. Use MCP docs for the recommended testing approach and best practices.
3. Prefer “testing trophy” prioritization:
   - unit tests for business logic
   - component tests for UI behavior
   - minimal integration/E2E only where needed
4. Offer templates when appropriate:
   - `app/vitest-config`
   - `app/react-testing-library-example`
