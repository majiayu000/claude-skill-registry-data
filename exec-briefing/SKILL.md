# Executive Briefing Kit Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing QBR/EBR agendas that include executive stakeholders.
- Summarizing account impact stories for CRO/CEO/CTO readouts.
- Documenting commitments and follow-ups after executive meetings.

## Framework
1. **Audience Lens** – capture what each executive cares about (business outcomes, risk, roadmap, financial impact).
2. **Narrative Structure** – headline, metrics, proof, decisions/asks, next steps.
3. **Visual Layer** – standardized slides/one-pagers with consistent KPIs and color coding.
4. **Decision Log** – track approvals, risks, and owners for follow-ups.
5. **Distribution Plan** – define recipients, timing, and archival location.

## Templates
- **Briefing Doc**: See `templates/briefing_doc.md` for agenda and summary structure.
- **Executive summary slide** (headline, impact, next action).
- **Meeting brief** (objectives, attendees, agenda, prep requirements).
- Decision log table with owners and deadlines.

## Tips
- Keep top section under 150 words; move detail to appendix.
- Pair with `success-planning-framework` to ensure talking points align to milestones.
- Send recap within 24 hours to reinforce commitments.
