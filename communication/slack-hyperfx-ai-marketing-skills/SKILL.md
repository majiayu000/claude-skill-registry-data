# Slack Messaging

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for Slack messaging, file sharing, and formatting.

## Requirements

- **Hyper MCP installed and connected.** [https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp](https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp)
- **Slack integration** enabled at [https://app.hyperfx.ai/apps](https://app.hyperfx.ai/apps).

### How to run the tools in this skill

Every tool in this skill is named by its canonical tool name. Run it with the call your surface gives you:

| Surface | Find a tool | Run it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP client (Claude, Cursor, Codex, ChatGPT) | `search("<what you want to do>")`, then `describe("<name>")` | `call("<name>", {...})` |
| Hyper CLI | `hyperai search "<what you want to do>"`, then `hyperai describe <name>` | `hyperai call <name> --json '{...}'` |

If a tool is not found, its integration is not connected or not enabled for the workspace: stop and tell the user which integration to connect.

## When NOT to Respond

Return ONLY the text `[NO_RESPONSE]` (nothing else) in these situations:

1. **Message mentions another user, not you**: If the user mentions another person (e.g., `@John` or `@SomeOtherBot`) and the message is directed at that person, not you.
2. **User explicitly asks to be ignored**: If the user says something like "ignore this", "don't respond", or similar.
3. **Message is clearly not for you**: If the conversation is between other users and doesn't require your input.
4. **Simple acknowledgments between users**: Messages like "thanks", "ok", "got it" directed at another person.

**IMPORTANT**:
- When you decide not to respond, return ONLY the exact text `[NO_RESPONSE]` with nothing before or after it.
- When in doubt, respond. It's better to be helpful than to stay silent when someone needs you.
- If someone mentions you by name or asks you a direct question, always respond.
- In DMs (direct messages), always respond unless explicitly asked not to.

## File Sharing - Critical Rules

**CRITICAL**: Files can ONLY be shared in Slack via upload. URLs and file paths do NOT render as viewable content in Slack.

- Use `slack_files_upload` to share any file in Slack
- Always upload to both the channel AND thread you are responding in, unless requested otherwise
- The `slack_files_upload` tool accepts a `file_id` parameter for files already stored in the system

### Sharing Generated Images

When you generate an image (e.g., via `images_generate`), the result includes a `file_id`. This image is NOT automatically displayed in Slack. You MUST explicitly upload it:

1. Generate the image using the image generation tool
2. Note the `file_id` from the result
3. Call `slack_files_upload` with that `file_id`, the current `channel_id`, and `thread_ts`

**Example workflow:**
- User asks: "Generate an image of a sunset"
- You call the image generation tool, which returns `file_id: "abc123"`
- You then call `slack_files_upload(channel_id="C...", file_id="abc123", thread_ts="...")`
- Now the image appears in Slack

Do NOT just say "Here's your image" without uploading it. The user will see nothing.

### Sharing Other Files

For any file you want to share (documents, CSVs, etc.), use `slack_files_upload` with either:
- `file_id`: For files already in the system
- `file_path`: For local files
- `content`: For text content to upload as a file

## Message Formatting

### When to Use Plain Text vs Block Kit
- **Simple messages**: Use plain markdown text via `slack_messages_send` or `slack_threads_replies_send`
- **Tables, lists, structured data**: Use Block Kit `rich_text` blocks via `slack_messages_send_block_kit`
- **Messages over 3000 characters**: Use `slack_messages_send_large`

### Slack Markdown
Slack uses a simplified markdown:
- `*bold*` (single asterisks, not double)
- `_italic_`
- `~strikethrough~`
- `` `code` `` for inline code
- ` ```code block``` ` for code blocks
- `<url|display text>` for links (NOT `[text](url)`)

### Block Kit Rich Text

Block Kit's `rich_text` block provides flexible formatting:

**Available Elements:**
- `rich_text_section`: Single line of text with inline formatting
- `rich_text_list`: Bulleted or ordered lists (`style: "bullet"` or `style: "ordered"`)
- `rich_text_quote`: Quote blocks with vertical bar styling

**Element Types Within Sections:**
- `text`: Plain or styled text (supports `bold`, `italic`, `strike`, `code`)
- `link`: Hyperlinks with optional display text
- `emoji`: Emoji by name
- `user`: User mentions
- `channel`: Channel mentions

**Bulleted List Example:**
```json
{
    "type": "rich_text",
    "elements": [
        {
            "type": "rich_text_list",
            "style": "bullet",
            "elements": [
                {
                    "type": "rich_text_section",
                    "elements": [{"type": "text", "text": "First item"}]
                },
                {
                    "type": "rich_text_section",
                    "elements": [{"type": "text", "text": "Second item"}]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Ordered List:** Use `"style": "ordered"` instead of `"bullet"`.

**Nested Lists:** Use the `indent` property:
```json
{
    "type": "rich_text_list",
    "style": "ordered",
    "indent": 1,
    "elements": [...]
}
```

**Inline Styling:**
```json
{
    "type": "text",
    "text": "Bold text",
    "style": {"bold": true}
}
```
Available styles: `bold`, `italic`, `strike`, `code`

**Links in Text:**
```json
{
    "type": "rich_text_section",
    "elements": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "Click "},
        {"type": "link", "text": "here", "url": "https://example.com"},
        {"type": "text", "text": " to continue"}
    ]
}
```
