# Twilio Communications

Use this skill for all Twilio tasks including SMS, WhatsApp, voice calls, and verification.

## Requirements

- **Hyper MCP installed and connected.** [https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp](https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp)
- **Twilio integration** enabled at [https://app.hyperfx.ai/apps](https://app.hyperfx.ai/apps).

### How to run the tools in this skill

Every tool in this skill is named by its canonical tool name. Run it with the call your surface gives you:

| Surface | Find a tool | Run it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP client (Claude, Cursor, Codex, ChatGPT) | `search("<what you want to do>")`, then `describe("<name>")` | `call("<name>", {...})` |
| Hyper CLI | `hyperai search "<what you want to do>"`, then `hyperai describe <name>` | `hyperai call <name> --json '{...}'` |

If a tool is not found, its integration is not connected or not enabled for the workspace: stop and tell the user which integration to connect.

## WhatsApp Sandbox Setup (Required for Testing)

Before sending WhatsApp messages in sandbox/testing mode, users must join the sandbox:

1. User goes to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/sms/try-it-out/whatsapp-learn
2. They find their unique join code (e.g., "join happy-turtle")
3. They send that message from WhatsApp to **+14155238886**
4. Once confirmed, use `twilio_whatsapp_send` with `from_number` set to `"+14155238886"`

**If WhatsApp message fails with "not a valid WhatsApp-enabled number" or similar:**
- The user likely hasn't joined the sandbox yet
- Guide them through the steps above

## Tool Quick Reference

### Messaging
- `twilio_sms_send` - Send SMS/MMS messages
- `twilio_whatsapp_send` - Send WhatsApp messages (sandbox: use +14155238886 as from_number)
- `twilio_messages_list` - List message history
- `twilio_messages_delivery_status_check` - Check if message was delivered

### Voice Calls
- `twilio_calls_create` - Initiate outbound call (requires TwiML URL or inline TwiML)
- `twilio_calls_list` - List call history
- `twilio_recordings_list` - List call recordings

### Phone Numbers
- `twilio_phone_numbers_list` - List numbers in account (use to find valid from_number)
- `twilio_phone_numbers_lookup` - Validate phone number and get carrier info

### Verification (OTP)
- `twilio_verification_services_create` - Create verification service first
- `twilio_verifications_send` - Send OTP code
- `twilio_verifications_check` - Verify user's code

## Common Patterns

**Before sending SMS/WhatsApp:** Call `twilio_phone_numbers_list` first to find a valid sender number.

**WhatsApp sandbox flow:**
1. Confirm user has joined sandbox (provide instructions if not)
2. Call `twilio_whatsapp_send` with:
```json
{
  "to": "+1XXXXXXXXXX",
  "body": "Hello from the assistant",
  "from_number": "+14155238886"
}
```

**Phone verification flow:**

Step 1 -- Call `twilio_verification_services_create` with:
```json
{
  "friendly_name": "My App"
}
```

Step 2 -- Call `twilio_verifications_send` with:
```json
{
  "service_sid": "<service_sid_from_step_1>",
  "to": "+1XXXXXXXXXX",
  "channel": "sms"
}
```

Step 3 -- Call `twilio_verifications_check` with:
```json
{
  "service_sid": "<service_sid>",
  "to": "+1XXXXXXXXXX",
  "code": "<user_provided_code>"
}
```

## Safety Rules

- Never assume a valid sender number; always verify with `twilio_phone_numbers_list`.
- Do not continue silently after failures; report exact error and ask user how to proceed.
- For verification flows, keep service SIDs and code checks explicit and auditable.
