## Лучшие практики

1. **Specificity over generality** — конкретные обязанности, а не "другие задачи"
2. **Show, don't tell** — описывайте работу, а не требуйте личностные качества
3. **Required = truly required** — минимизируйте "обязательные" требования
4. **Benefits matter** — подробно описывайте компенсацию и бенефиты
5. **Mobile-first** — форматирование для мобильных устройств
6. **Test for bias** — проверяйте текст на инклюзивность
