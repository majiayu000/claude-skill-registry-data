# Imaging-Data Skill

The dataset decides more of a study than the architecture does, and it decides it first. Phases 1–3
establish what the data is and what it will not support, while that is still cheap; Phases 4–7 design
and audit the preparation pipeline so it is leakage-safe before `/model-scaffold` builds the repo.
Describe-and-audit only: never modify, resample, reorient, split or write image data, never run
preprocessing on real patient data, and wire MONAI / TorchIO transforms by reference rather than
writing a new normalisation or resampling implementation.

Elsewhere: tabular/clinical variables → `/generate-codebook`, `/clean-data`; auditing the split
table, held-out metrics, calibration, subgroup results → `/model-assessment`; choosing an
architecture → `/model-selection`; building the repo → `/model-scaffold`.

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Profile every case
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/profile_imaging_dataset.py \
    --split train:imagesTr:labelsTr \
    --split test:imagesTs \
    --dataset "MSD Task09 Spleen" \
    --declared-labels 0=background,1=spleen \
    --target-label 1 \
    --plan resample=true,reorient=false,loss=dice_ce,metrics=dice+hd95 \
    --out eda/profile.json
```
One record per case: grid, spacing, orientation, intensity percentiles, the label values actually
present, foreground fraction, and target volume in mL. A `--split` given no label directory is
recorded as **unlabelled** — itself a finding. Requires `nibabel` + `numpy`; the gate does not.
Every profile figure comes from opening the files — never from a dataset's README, a similar dataset,
or memory. A README can be wrong about its own label indices; the labels cannot.

**`--target-label` on a multi-structure atlas.** Foreground defaults to every non-zero index — the
whole annotated anatomy. Measured on the AMOS22 CT cases, that pools to 3.2 % instead of the spleen's 0.20 %, so the
pooled figure sits above the 1 % imbalance threshold while the target sits far below it and the
imbalance verdicts go quiet exactly where the risk is. Naming the target also makes `LABEL_EMPTY` mean
*this case has no spleen*. Pass `--target-label all` for a genuinely multi-class study; leave it out
on a multi-structure atlas and the gate raises `TARGET_LABEL_UNDECLARED`.

### Phase 2 — Gate the profile against the declared plan
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_dataset_profile.py --profile eda/profile.json \
    --out qc/dataset_profile.json --strict
```
Stdlib-only, so the audit re-runs anywhere the JSON travels. Never report a profile "pass" without
running it.

| Verdict | Severity | Fires when |
|---|---|---|
| `LABEL_SHAPE_MISMATCH` | Major | label grid ≠ image grid |
| `LABEL_EMPTY` | Major | a labelled case has zero foreground |
| `LABEL_VALUE_UNEXPECTED` | Major | label values outside the declared set |
| `TEST_SET_UNLABELLED` | Major | a split named test/held-out/external/eval carries no labels |
| `ACCURACY_UNDER_IMBALANCE` | Major | accuracy is planned while the target is a sliver of the volume |
| `LABEL_MISSING` | Minor | a case in a labelled split has no label file |
| `SPACING_HETEROGENEOUS` | Minor | spacing spans ≥ ratio on an axis and no resampling is declared |
| `ORIENTATION_MIXED` | Minor | >1 orientation code and no reorientation declared |
| `INTENSITY_SCALE_INCONSISTENT` | Minor | some cases on the HU scale, others not |
| `EXTREME_IMBALANCE` | Minor | median foreground below the threshold with no Dice-family loss |
| `TARGET_LABEL_UNDECLARED` | Minor | >1 structure declared, no target named, so foreground pools them all |

The gate flags an **undeclared decision, not variability**: 5× spacing spread and two orientation
codes pass once resampling and reorientation are declared (the clean challenge fixture proves this).
`--spacing-ratio` (default 2.0) and `--imbalance-frac` (default 0.01) are **screening defaults, not
published cut-points** — never present them as such; the values applied are printed in the output
and belong in the Methods. A split the profile shows unlabelled is never a held-out test set, however
the directory is named.

### Phase 3 — Turn the profile into research decisions
Write these decision notes into the study record, so `/design-study`, the preparation phases below,
and `/write-paper` inherit them instead of re-deriving them:
1. **Resampling target** — from the spacing distribution, not a tutorial default (carried into Phase 5).
2. **Loss and metric family** — from the foreground fraction. Segmentation reports Dice **and** a
   boundary metric per structure (`/model-assessment`); accuracy is not on the list.
3. **Pre-specified subgroups** — from the clinical spread the profile shows (target volume, slice
   thickness, modality). Pre-specifying them here is what separates a subgroup finding from a post-hoc one.
4. **Where the held-out set comes from** — especially when the shipped "test" directory is unlabelled.
5. **What the cohort cannot support** — n, single-source acquisition, absent subgroups: the seed of
   the Limitations paragraph, written before results can bias it.

### Phase 4 — Inventory the preparation steps and fix fit scope
Collect the modality, the data manifest (one row per image/slice with a `patient_id`), the resample
spacing, the intensity transform (fixed HU window vs a fitted z-score / min-max / histogram match),
and the augmentation plan. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/preprocessing_guide.md` for the
modality-aware normalisation, physiology-preserving vs -breaking augmentation, and MONAI / TorchIO wiring.
- Fit dataset-level normalisation on the **training split only** — never all/full/test.
- Run any data-fitted transform **after** the split; before it there is no train/test distinction.
- Prefer per-image (per-sample) normalisation where clinically appropriate — leakage-free even before the split.
- Keep augmentation **train-only**; augmenting val/test folds undisclosed test-time augmentation into the metric.
- Split at the **patient** level, then map slices to their patient's split.

### Phase 5 — Emit the preprocessing manifest
Write `preprocessing_manifest.json`, which `/model-scaffold` consumes and the gate checks. Every value
comes from the real data manifest and the declared pipeline — never invented patient IDs or split
assignments.

```json
{
  "split_seed": 42,
  "transforms": [
    {"name": "hu_window", "type": "clip", "fit_scope": "none", "stage": "before_split"},
    {"name": "train_zscore", "type": "standardize", "fit_scope": "train", "stage": "after_split"},
    {"name": "flip_rotate", "type": "augmentation", "stage": "after_split", "applies_to": ["train"]}
  ],
  "split_assignment": [
    {"patient_id": "P001", "unit_id": "P001_s1", "split": "train"}
  ]
}
```

`fit_scope`: `train` (OK) · `all`/`full`/`dataset`/`test` (leak) · `sample`/`per_image`/`none`/`fixed`
(not data-fitted). `stage`: `before_split` / `after_split`. The fields must describe what the code
actually does — never tag a dataset-fitted transform per-sample to clear the gate; that hides the leak.
A declared dataset-level `fit_scope` is judged whatever the `type` is, so a library class name
(`HistogramStandardization`, `NormalizeIntensityd`) fit on `all` is a leak like `standardize` would be.

**Declare the fit scope of resampling too.** A target spacing chosen in advance is `fit_scope: fixed`
and never leaks. A target derived from the cohort does: nnU-Net sets its target spacing from a
percentile of the dataset fingerprint, so a resample fitted over every case carries held-out geometry
into the training grid exactly as an intensity statistic would. The fingerprint's scope decides which
you have, not the word "resample".

### Phase 6 — Gate the manifest
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_preprocessing_leakage.py --manifest preprocessing_manifest.json \
    --out qc/preprocessing_leakage.json --strict
```
Verdicts: `PREPROCESS_BEFORE_SPLIT`, `NORMALIZATION_LEAKAGE`, `PATIENT_CROSS_SPLIT` (Major);
`AUGMENTATION_ON_EVAL`, `UNSPECIFIED_FIT_SCOPE`, `MISSING_SEED` (Minor), reproduced by set arithmetic
and rule on the manifest. A green gate is the precondition for handing the manifest to
`/model-scaffold`; its `split_assignment` is the same patient-level split `/model-assessment` later
re-verifies. Never report a pass without running it.

### Phase 7 — Before inference on a new cohort: check the normaliser's domain
Phase 6 asks whether a transform was fit on the right **scope**. Before running a trained model on a
cohort it was not trained on, ask whether that cohort sits in the intensity **domain** the trained
normaliser assumes:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_normalizer_domain.py \
    --profile eda/<cohort>_profile.json \
    --contract work/nnUNet_results/.../plans.json \
    --splits external_mri --out qc/normalizer_domain.json --strict
```
Its challenge card holds a cohort in the contract's own domain that must come back clean, an
arbitrary-unit cohort that must raise a Major, and an unreadable contract that must refuse rather than pass.

## Outputs and hand-off

- `eda/profile.json` (Phase 1), `qc/dataset_profile.json` (Phase 2), and the decision notes (Phase 3).
- `preprocessing_manifest.json` with the augmentation-appropriateness and normalisation fit-scope
  notes (Phases 4–5), `qc/preprocessing_leakage.json` (Phase 6), `qc/normalizer_domain.json` (Phase 7).

The manifest feeds `/model-scaffold`; it documents the CLAIM 2024 / TRIPOD+AI data-preprocessing items
for `/check-reporting`; `/self-review`'s `model_development` probe looks for exactly this pipeline in a
finished manuscript. Regression: `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_dataset_profile_challenge/verify.sh`,
