## Best Practices

- **Show, don't tell** - Reveal character and emotion through action and dialogue
- **Start with conflict** - Open scenes in the middle of tension, not setup
- **Use specific details** - "Rusted Chevy pickup" beats "old truck"
- **Vary sentence structure** - Mix short punchy lines with longer flowing ones
- **Cut ruthlessly** - Every word must serve character, plot, or atmosphere
- **Read dialogue aloud** - If it sounds stiff, rewrite it
- **Plant and pay off** - Set up details early that matter later
- **Raise stakes continuously** - Make things progressively harder for protagonist
- **Avoid cliches** - Find fresh ways to express familiar ideas
- **Use active voice** - "She opened the door" not "The door was opened"
- **Trust the reader** - Don't over-explain emotions or motivations
- **Create meaningful obstacles** - Challenges should test character's core weakness
- **Balance description** - Enough to visualize, not so much it slows pace
- **Write consistent POV** - Don't head-hop within scenes
- **End chapters with hooks** - Give readers a reason to keep going
