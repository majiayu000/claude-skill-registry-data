# Blind Spot Chain

**"What am I missing?"**

## The Sequence

```
1. Collision-Zone       → What if we smashed X into Y?
         ↓
2. Critical-Perspective → What assumptions am I making?
         ↓
3. Scale-Game           → What breaks at 1000x or 0.001x?
         ↓
4. Synthesis            → What patterns emerge from 1-3?
         ↓
5. Simplification       → What one insight eliminates multiple things?
```

## When to Use

- "Something feels off but I can't name it"
- Stuck on a problem, tried obvious solutions
- Before committing to a major decision
- When you've been in one frame too long
- Reviewing your own work

## The Five Phases

### 1. Collision-Zone Thinking
> "What if we treated X like Y?"

Force unrelated concepts together. See what emerges.

### 2. Critical Perspective
> "What am I assuming without noticing?"

Question the frame. What's taken for granted?

### 3. Scale Game
> "What happens at extremes?"

Test at 1000x bigger, 1000x smaller, instant, year-long.

### 4. Synthesis
> "What patterns emerge?"

Integrate findings from phases 1-3.

### 5. Simplification Cascades
> "If THIS is true, what else falls away?"

Find the one insight that eliminates multiple components.

## Output Format

```
BLIND SPOT CHECK: [topic]

COLLISIONS:
  - X + Y → [spark]

ASSUMPTIONS FOUND:
  - [hidden assumption]

SCALE BREAKS:
  - At 1000x: [what breaks]
  - At 0.001x: [what breaks]

SYNTHESIS:
  - Pattern: [survived all phases]

SIMPLIFICATION:
  - If [X], then [Y, Z, W] all unnecessary

BLIND SPOT IDENTIFIED:
  [What you weren't seeing]
```

## Different from Pentad
