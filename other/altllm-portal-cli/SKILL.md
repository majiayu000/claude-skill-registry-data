# AltLLM Portal CLI

Use this umbrella skill when working inside this repository and the task crosses multiple Portal domains. For focused requests, prefer one of the domain skills below.

AltLLM itself has two distinct surfaces that are easy to confuse:

- the **Portal API**, which manages auth, billing, API keys, and payment links
- the **OpenAI-compatible gateway**, which consumes Portal-issued API keys for model inference

This skill family is specifically about the **Portal CLI workflow** in this repository. Use it to operate the Portal side safely and consistently, not to document or proxy the gateway itself.

## Shared Setup

> Before the first `altllm` command in a fresh checkout, read and follow:
> - `../_shared/preflight.md`
> - `../_shared/session-and-target.md`

## Skill Map

| Skill | Purpose | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| `altllm-portal-auth` | Wallet login and session bootstrap | Wallet challenge, signature verification, login troubleshooting |
| `altllm-portal-api-keys` | Portal API key lifecycle | Create, inspect, disable, re-enable, or revoke API keys |
| `altllm-portal-billing` | Balance, promo, transactions, and usage analytics | Credit balance, promo redemption, billing history, usage views |
| `altllm-portal-payments` | NOWPayments link creation, polling, and direct payment execution | Crypto top-up links, payment status, direct wallet payment |
| `altllm-x402` | Portal x402 credit top-up guidance | BSC/USDT x402 quotes, discount top-ups, wallet signing, settlement, facilitator errors |

## Plan Awareness

- Personal tiers are `free`, `basic`, `pro`, and `power`; Business/Flex is `flex`.
- Use `credit` to inspect plan/model-access metadata returned by Portal, including `subscription_tier: "flex"` when present.
- Flex users can create API key allowlists with normal AltLLM model IDs and Flex-only `altllm-flex-*` IDs, subject to backend access checks.

## Working Rules

- Prefer the focused skill when the request stays within one domain.
- Use this umbrella skill when the workflow spans multiple domains, for example:
  - login -> create API key -> verify gateway use
  - credit -> transactions -> usage analytics
  - top-up -> payment-status -> pay-payment-link
  - x402 quote -> wallet signing -> settlement -> balance verification
- Keep implementation and docs aligned when behavior changes.
