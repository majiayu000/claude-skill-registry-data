# Changelog Maintenance

Follow Keep a Changelog format with sections: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security. Write entries for users, not developers. Include migration instructions for breaking changes. Link to relevant issues or PRs. Version entries with semantic versioning. Update the changelog as part of the PR, not retroactively. "Unreleased" section collects changes between releases.
