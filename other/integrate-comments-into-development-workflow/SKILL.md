# Integrate Comments into Development Workflow

## When to Use This Skill
- When actively writing code for a software project
- When planning development tasks and estimating time
- When concerned about code maintainability and documentation
- When experiencing resistance to writing comments during development

## Core Procedure

### 1. Write Comments Concurrently
- Write comments as you code, not after
- Treat commenting as part of the coding process, not a separate task
- Never defer commenting to the end of the project

### 2. Handle Intense Focus Scenarios
If writing comments during coding interrupts your flow:
1. Design the logic in pseudocode first
2. Convert the pseudocode into comments
3. Implement the actual code based on the comments

### 3. Address Design Complexity
If the design is too complex to code or comment:
1. Simplify the design first
2. Don't worry about comments or code until the design is clear
3. Once simplified, proceed with concurrent commenting

## Why This Matters

Leaving comments to the end creates problems:
- **Increased effort**: Becomes a large, separate task that feels overwhelming
- **Time waste**: Requires recalling or re-understanding code logic instead of documenting current thoughts
- **Inaccuracy**: Assumptions and design nuances are forgotten, leading to misleading comments

## Expected Outcome
Comments written concurrently with code, ensuring accuracy and reducing future rework.
