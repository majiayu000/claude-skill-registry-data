# /github-release-briefing-skill

Create a current briefing for the latest published release of one public GitHub
repository. Run `scripts/run_pipeline.py` with an `OWNER/REPOSITORY` input.
The command uses GitHub's public REST endpoint, writes a Markdown briefing, and
does not authenticate, publish, modify a repository, or download release assets.

```bash
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py --repository openai/openai-python --output release.md
```

## Required behavior

1. Reject malformed repository identifiers before any request.
2. Retrieve only the latest published release and identify its tag, title, date, and URL.
3. State clearly when a repository has no published release or is unavailable.
4. Include the GitHub API source URL so a human can inspect the result.

## Gotchas

- A GitHub "latest" release excludes drafts and prereleases according to the API's rules.
- This is dependency-awareness evidence, not a change-approval recommendation.
- Public API availability and release content can change after retrieval.
