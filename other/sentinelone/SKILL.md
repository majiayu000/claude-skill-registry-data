# SentinelOne  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `sentinelone-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/sentinelone/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/sentinelone/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `sentinelone-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `sentinelone-cli` and `sentinelone-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Query and manage your whole SentinelOne fleet from the terminal: agents, threats, activities, sites, groups, exclusions, Ranger, and more. Sync to a local store for offline full-text search, then run analytics the console can't  -  `fleet-health stale` ranks decaying endpoints, `threats blast-radius` traces one hash across the fleet, `whatchanged --since 24h` diffs overnight, and `posture` rolls up a per-tenant scorecard. Ships an MCP server so an AI agent can drive all of it.

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI when an agent or analyst needs to query or act on a SentinelOne tenant from the terminal or via MCP: listing and filtering agents/threats/activities, taking agent or threat actions, or  -  its differentiator  -  answering cross-entity and historical questions (fleet health, coverage gaps, blast radius, overnight drift, version rollout, MTTR) that the web console and raw API can't compute. Prefer it over raw API calls whenever the question spans multiple entities, multiple sites, or time.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Data Lake / Purple AI queries (alerts, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, PowerQuery events)  -  that is a different SentinelOne surface; use the official Sentinel-One/purple-mcp server instead.
- Bulk SIEM-scale telemetry ingestion of Deep Visibility events  -  use the official SIEM integrations (Sumo Logic, Google SecOps); this CLI persists bounded dv pulls, not a streaming pipeline.
- Console-only settings not exposed by the v2.1 management API (SSO config, billing, console UI preferences)  -  use the web console.
- Anything requiring request bodies the public spec omits beyond the documented --stdin JSON passthrough  -  check the tenant's own api-doc for exact field names first.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Time-Travel & Diffing

- **`whatchanged`**  -  One answer to 'what changed across all my tenants since I logged off?'  -  new threats, newly-offline or newly-unhealthy agents, version regressions, and protection-mode flips. Needs at least 2 syncs of local history.

  _Reach for this instead of paging Get_Threats + Get_Agents and diffing by hand  -  it returns the cross-entity delta over a window that no single API call provides._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli whatchanged --since 24h --agent
  ```
- **`threats verdicts`**  -  Flags threats whose analyst verdict, confidence level, or incident status changed since the last sync  -  suspicious to malicious, or an auto-mitigated threat re-opened  -  so nothing flips silently. Needs at least 2 syncs of local history.

  _Use to catch silent verdict flips  -  it diffs against stored prior state the API doesn't retain._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli threats verdicts --changed --agent
  ```

### Threat Intelligence Joins

- **`threats recurrence`**  -  Surfaces threats whose same hash or name re-appears across endpoints  -  or returns on an endpoint after a prior mitigation  -  the signal of an unkilled root cause. Needs at least 2 syncs of local history.

  _Use when a threat keeps coming back  -  it identifies the recurring hash/endpoint pair a single threat listing can't reveal._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli threats recurrence --by-agent --agent
  ```
- **`threats mttr`**  -  Computes mean time from threat detection to mitigation per site, and flags SLA breaches and the longest-unresolved threats. Needs at least 2 syncs of local history.

  _Use to report response performance  -  it derives detection-to-mitigation durations the API only exposes as raw timestamps._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli threats mttr --agent
  ```
- **`threats blast-radius`**  -  For one threat, instantly shows every endpoint it touched, which are mitigated vs still active, the affected sites/groups, and the spread timeline.

  _Use during incident response  -  it answers 'where else is this?' by joining one threat across the whole fleet and timeline._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli threats blast-radius 3f5a9c2e1b7d8a4f6c0e2d1a9b8c7f6e5d4c3b2a --agent
  ```
- **`threats triage`**  -  One ranked, cross-site worklist of every open threat  -  scored by confidence × severity × age  -  so the morning triage order needs zero console scope flips.

  _Reach for this first each morning  -  it returns the cross-site triage order no single threats query computes._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli threats triage --agent
  ```
- **`agents dossier`**  -  Everything about one endpoint on one card: agent state, full threat history, recent activities, and site/group membership  -  the IR handoff view.

  _Use when drilling into one box during incident response  -  it joins the endpoint's whole story in one call._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli agents dossier "FINANCE-LT-042" --agent
  ```

### Fleet Health & Coverage

- **`fleet-health stale`**  -  Ranks endpoints by a composite decay score  -  last-seen age, last-scan age, out-of-date agent version, and reduced or disabled protection  -  so the riskiest agents triage first.

  _Reach for this to answer 'which endpoints are rotting?'  -  a ranked health score the console never computes._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli fleet-health stale --agent
  ```
- **`coverage gaps`**  -  Lists endpoints in detect-only mode, with self-protection off, or with Ranger/firewall/device-control disabled  -  the 'are we actually protecting everyone?' compliance view per tenant.

  _Use for compliance/QBR prep  -  it finds unprotected endpoints by site that require joining policy state to site membership._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli coverage gaps --agent
  ```
- **`versions rollout`**  -  Shows agent-version distribution per site over time and flags sites stuck on EOL/old versions or stalled mid-upgrade-wave. Needs at least 2 syncs of local history.

  _Reach for this during an upgrade campaign  -  it tracks rollout progress per site, which requires snapshot history the API doesn't keep._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli versions rollout --agent
  ```
- **`ranger exposure`**  -  Surfaces unmanaged/rogue endpoints on each subnet by cross-referencing Ranger-discovered devices against managed agents, ranked by managed-peer density.

  _Reach for this to find blind spots  -  it joins network discovery to managed agents to surface rogue devices a single listing can't._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli ranger exposure --agent
  ```
- **`fleet-health summary`**  -  At-a-glance fleet counts  -  online/offline/decommissioned, infected, out-of-date, under-protected  -  across all sites in one call.

  _Use for the weekly fleet sweep  -  one command replaces the per-client CSV-export-and-pivot ritual._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli fleet-health summary --agent
  ```

### Reporting & Rollups

- **`posture`**  -  A one-page per-tenant rollup  -  agent health %, coverage %, open-threat count, oldest unresolved, version compliance  -  for the morning MSSP review or a client QBR.

  _Reach for this for a client-ready summary  -  it composes health, coverage, and threat metrics into one scorecard the API never returns._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli posture --agent
  ```
- **`exclusions audit`**  -  Flags risky exclusions  -  never matched by any threat, wildcard paths, and entries older than a threshold  -  the 'are we hiding real threats?' review.

  _Use for periodic security hygiene  -  it cross-references exclusions to threat history the API never correlates._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli exclusions audit --agent
  ```
- **`sites risk`**  -  Ranks sites/clients against each other by composite risk  -  open-threat density, coverage gaps, stale agents, MTTR  -  so you know which tenant to call first.

  _Reach for this for the portfolio view  -  it ranks every client by risk in one command._

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli sites risk --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
sentinelone-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query. `--json` (and other machine formats) keep that exit-2 contract and write `{"matches":[]}` on stdout so agents can inspect the envelope without treating a miss as success.

## Recipes


### Triage overnight

```bash
sentinelone-cli whatchanged --since 24h --agent
```

Cross-entity delta of new threats, lost/unhealthy agents, and mode flips since yesterday.

### Morning triage worklist

```bash
sentinelone-cli threats triage --agent
```

Every open threat across all sites, ranked by confidence × severity × age  -  the cross-site triage order the console can't show.

### Narrow a noisy threat feed

```bash
sentinelone-cli threats get --agent --select data.threatInfo.threatName,data.threatInfo.sha1,data.agentRealtimeInfo.agentComputerName
```

Pair --agent with --select dotted paths to pull only the high-gravity fields from deeply-nested threat objects.

### Find decaying endpoints

```bash
sentinelone-cli fleet-health stale --agent
```

Composite decay rank across last-seen, last-scan, version, and protection state.

### Trace a threat across the fleet

```bash
sentinelone-cli threats blast-radius 3f5a9c2e1b7d8a4f6c0e2d1a9b8c7f6e5d4c3b2a --agent
```

Every endpoint a hash touched, mitigated vs active, with a spread timeline.

### Client QBR scorecard

```bash
sentinelone-cli posture --agent
```

Per-site health %, coverage %, open threats, and version compliance in one rollup.

## Auth Setup

Authenticate with a SentinelOne API token: create a Service User (Settings > Users > Service Users), generate its API token, then set `SENTINELONE_API_TOKEN`. Tokens are sent as `Authorization: ApiToken <token>` and inherit the generating user's role and scope. Point the CLI at your console with `SENTINELONE_BASE_URL=https://<your-console>.sentinelone.net/web/api/v2.1`. Run `sentinelone-cli doctor` to confirm reachability and auth.
Run `sentinelone-cli auth setup` to print the URL and steps for getting a key (add `--launch` to open the URL). Then set:

```bash
export SENTINELONE_API_TOKEN="<your-key>"
```
To persist credentials, use `echo "$TOKEN" | sentinelone-cli auth set-token`. Stored secrets live in `credentials.toml` under the data dir, not in `config.toml`.

Run `sentinelone-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color`.

Global format flags share one contract on promoted, novel, sync, and `--deliver` paths:

- `--json`  -  one JSON document on stdout (sync progress events go to stderr)
- `--compact`  -  keep identity/status/timestamp fields; does not change the document vs stream shape
- `--csv` / `--plain`  -  tabular rows (collection envelopes unwrap to the row array)
- `--quiet`  -  one identity value per row, no envelope

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  sentinelone-cli accounts get --agent
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit confirmation**  -  `--agent` does not imply `--yes`; pass `--yes` separately only after the target, arguments, and side effects are clear
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and use `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Paths and state

Agents should treat the CLI's path resolver as part of the runtime contract:

- Use `--home <dir>` for one invocation, or set `SENTINELONE_HOME=<dir>` to relocate all four path kinds under one root.
- Use per-kind env vars only when a specific kind must diverge: `SENTINELONE_CONFIG_DIR`, `SENTINELONE_DATA_DIR`, `SENTINELONE_STATE_DIR`, `SENTINELONE_CACHE_DIR`.
- Resolution order is per-kind env var, `--home`, `SENTINELONE_HOME`, XDG (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`), then platform defaults.
- `config` contains settings like `config.toml` and profiles. `data` contains `credentials.toml`, `data.db`, cookies, and auth sidecars. `state` contains persisted queries, jobs, and `teach.log`. `cache` contains regenerable HTTP/cache files.
- Stored secrets live in `credentials.toml` under the data dir. Existing legacy `config.toml` secrets are read for compatibility and leave `config.toml` on the first auth write.
- Run `sentinelone-cli doctor --fail-on warn` to surface path and credential-location warnings. `agent-context` exposes a schema v4 `paths` block for agents that need the resolved dirs.
- For MCP, pass relocation through the MCP host config. The MCP binary does not inherit CLI flags:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "sentinelone": {
        "command": "sentinelone-mcp",
        "env": {
          "SENTINELONE_HOME": "/srv/sentinelone"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

Fleet precedence: an inherited per-kind env var overrides an explicit `--home` for that kind. Use `SENTINELONE_HOME` or per-kind vars as durable fleet levers, and use `--home` only for a single invocation. Relocation is not reversible by unsetting env vars; move files manually before clearing `SENTINELONE_HOME`, or `doctor` will not find credentials left under the former root.

## Automatic learning

This CLI ships a self-capturing learning loop. The CLI does its own bookkeeping: every invocation is journaled locally, a failed flag followed by a corrected retry auto-derives a `flag_alias` candidate, and a `teach` on a query family without a playbook auto-synthesizes a `playbook_candidate` from the session's journal. Your job is judgment only: `recall` first, act on surfaced candidates, `teach` the final answer, `playbook amend` when you observe a correction. You never record failures by hand.

### Step 1: `recall` before any discovery

Before list/search/drill commands on a new user question, pass the question as an argv or MCP tool argument to `recall --agent`. Do not interpolate user-controlled text into a shell command line.

Quoted `recall "<question>"` breaks on an apostrophe, which is ordinary English. A quoted heredoc breaks when a body line equals the delimiter, and that delimiter is published in these docs. Write the question with a non-shell file-writing tool, then read it back as data:

```bash
# Write the question verbatim with your file-writing tool (no shell involved).
# Command substitution on a file only ever yields data  -  the shell never
# parses the file's bytes as syntax.
QUERY=$(cat /path/to/question.txt)
sentinelone-cli recall "$QUERY" --agent
```

Prefer MCP: pass the question as the tool's query argument. `"$QUERY"` after a file read is argv-safe; putting the question itself in the command text is not.

The response envelope:

```json
{
  "query": "...",
  "normalized": "<normalized form>",
  "query_entities": ["..."],
  "found": true | false,
  "match_score": 0.0,
  "results": [
    { "resource_id": "...", "resource_type": "...", "venue": "...",
      "confidence": 2, "entity_match": "exact|partial|unknown",
      "source": "taught|preseed|pattern", "warnings": ["..."] }
  ],
  "mismatches": [ /* only when --debug-mismatches */ ],
  "warnings": [ /* top-level */ ],
  "candidates": [
    { "id": 12, "class": "flag_alias | playbook_candidate",
      "summary": "...", "sightings": 3, "last_seen": "...",
      "rationale": "...",
      "next_action": ["<trial command>", "sentinelone-cli learnings confirm 12"] }
  ],
  "playbook": {
    "query_family": "...",
    "playbook": {
      "steps": [ { "cmd": "<command with {slot} substitution>", "purpose": "..." } ],
      "entity_slots": ["$ENTITY"],
      "expected_tool_calls": 3
    },
    "slots_resolved": { "$ENTITY": { "token": "<live token>", "canonical": "<canonical>" } },
    "notes": "<workarounds + gotchas for this query family>"
  },
  "notes": "<duplicate surface for non-playbook callers>"
}
```

Empty-store short-circuit: if the store has no learnings, playbooks, or candidates yet (recall finds nothing and `learnings list` and `learnings candidates` are both empty), skip recall for the rest of this session instead of taxing every query; resume recall-first once something has been taught.

### Step 2: decision tree

Read `candidates`, `playbook`, `notes`, `results[0]`, and warnings in that order:

```
if Candidates present (warnings include "candidates_present"):
    -> candidates are try-then-confirm, never facts. Follow each candidate's
       two-step next_action verbatim: run the trial command first, then run
       `learnings confirm <id>` only after the trial verified the behavior.
       Reject a wrong candidate with `learnings reject <id>`.
    -> NEVER re-teach something recall surfaced as a candidate; confirm or
       reject that candidate instead of teaching a duplicate.
    -> candidates ride alongside playbooks and resource hits, not instead of
       them; continue with the branches below after acting on them.

if Playbook present:
    -> READ Playbook.notes verbatim FIRST (workarounds + gotchas the CLI surface doesn't expose)
    -> replay Playbook.steps in order, substituting Playbook.slots_resolved entries
       for the entity slot tokens. If a step's slot is unresolved, fall back to
       discovery for that step only.
    -> the Playbook's expected_tool_calls is a budget; if you find yourself running
       materially more, record the divergence via `sentinelone-cli playbook amend`
       at end-of-session.

elif Notes present (no Playbook):
    -> read Notes verbatim before any discovery step; they carry known gotchas
       for this query family even when no structured choreography exists yet.

elif Found AND Results[0].EntityMatch == "exact" AND Results[0].Confidence >= 2:
    -> skip discovery; fetch live data for Results[*].ResourceID in parallel

elif Found AND Results[0].EntityMatch == "partial":
    -> candidate hint, NOT a hit; read the resource title to validate before trusting

elif (any row in Mismatches[] when --debug-mismatches was passed):
    -> treat as cold start; the stored learning is for a different entity
       (different canonical resolved from query_entities)

else:  // Found == false, no playbook, no notes
    -> cold start; run discovery normally; teach the answer afterward (Step 4).
       If the family has no playbook yet, that teach auto-synthesizes a
       playbook candidate from this session's journal - you do not need to
       record one by hand.
```

Playbook and Notes are orthogonal to the per-resource path. A recall response can carry both a Playbook AND a `Results[]` hit - use both: the Playbook tells you which choreography to run; the resource hits short-circuit specific steps. Default to skipping `mismatches`; pass `--debug-mismatches` only when investigating cold-start surprises.

Candidate judgment details: `learnings confirm <id>` prints the candidate's full payload before materializing it - check that the printed payload matches the behavior you verified. `learnings reject <id>` tombstones the derivation signature so the same candidate does not resurface. The envelope carries only the few candidates worth acting on now; `sentinelone-cli learnings candidates` lists the full open set.

Graceful degradation: if `learnings confirm` is an unknown command, you are driving an older binary - ignore the candidates guidance and follow the rest of the protocol.

### Step 3: always read `warnings`

- `low_confidence`: row exists at `confidence<2`. Treat as a hint, not a skip-discovery hit.
- `resource_not_in_store`: the local store doesn't have the resource the learning points at. The match validator couldn't classify entities  -  direct-fetch and re-evaluate.
- `cross_alias_match` (per-result): the row was taught under a different alias and matched the live query's canonical via `entity_lookups` (e.g., a "USA" teach satisfying a "United States" recall). Trust the resource_id.
- `similar_shape_different_entity:<canonical>` (top-level): a structurally matching row exists but its canonical entity differs from the live query's. Treated as cold start; the warning carries the conflicting canonical as a hint, but the row is NOT promoted into Results.
- `ambiguous_alias` (top-level): a single query entity resolved to multiple canonicals (e.g., "Cards" → Arizona Cardinals + St. Louis Cardinals). Surface the ambiguity from context before committing to a resource.
- `candidates_present` (top-level): the envelope carries a `candidates` section. Handle it via the candidates branch in Step 2 before anything else.
- `lookup_refresh_available` (top-level): an entity in the query has no lookup row yet, but synced data could provide one. Run `sentinelone-cli sync` to refresh entity lookups.
- Top-level `no_learnings_for_query_family`: the table had no rows above the Jaccard floor. Pure cold start.

### Step 4: `teach &` after finalizing your response - always

Teaching is unconditional. After resolving a query the store could not answer, background-teach the final resource mapping - no call-count threshold, no judging whether it was "worth" learning. The teach is the anchor of the loop: it triggers playbook synthesis for a family without a playbook, and same-referent phrasings fold into one family so near-duplicate teaches do not fragment the store. Fire it after assembling your user-facing response but BEFORE emitting it, with a shell `&` so the call returns immediately. Pass the query the same way as recall  -  argv/MCP, or file-then-`$QUERY`. Do not splice the question into the command text:

```bash
QUERY=$(cat /path/to/question.txt)
sentinelone-cli teach --query "$QUERY" --resource-type <type> --resource <id1> --resource <id2>
# (append shell `&` to background it)
```

Silent on success. Errors only land in `teach.log` under the resolved state dir. Teach the **most specific** resource - if the user asked a broad question and you walked through parent records to find the specific answer, teach the leaf id, not the parent. The CLI uses seeded `entity_lookups` for cross-alias resolution at recall time, so a teach under one alias (e.g., "Niners") satisfies future queries under another alias (e.g., "49ers", "San Francisco") automatically.

PII rule: teach the structural question with identifiers stripped - never include names, emails, phone numbers, account ids, or other personal identifiers in taught queries or notes. The CLI scans teach queries for obvious email/phone shapes and warns, but does not block; strip before teaching rather than relying on the warning.

### Step 5: playbooks - optional flags, automatic synthesis

You do not need to decide whether a session "deserves" a playbook: a teach on a family without one auto-synthesizes a `playbook_candidate` from the session's journal, and the next session judges it via confirm/reject. Attach explicit playbook flags only when you already hold choreography worth recording verbatim - workarounds the CLI didn't surface (silently-dropped flags, undocumented params, pagination tricks, payload gotchas). Prefer the **integrated one-call form** - record the resource learning and the playbook in the same `teach` invocation:

```bash
# Common case: record both the resource learning AND the playbook in one call.
QUERY=$(cat /path/to/question.txt)
sentinelone-cli teach \
  --query "$QUERY" \
  --resource <id> \
  --playbook-file ~/playbooks/<shape>.json \
  --playbook-notes-file ~/playbooks/<shape>-notes.md
# (append shell `&` to background it)

# Alternate: playbook-only (no resource to record alongside).
QUERY=$(cat /path/to/question.txt)
sentinelone-cli teach-playbook \
  --query "$QUERY" \
  --playbook-file ~/playbooks/<shape>.json \
  --notes-file ~/playbooks/<shape>-notes.md
```

Playbook files are JSON with `steps`, `entity_slots`, `expected_tool_calls`. Notes files are markdown carrying the gotchas verbatim. File-free callers (MCP-only agents) pass the same content inline: `--playbook-json` and `--playbook-notes` on the integrated `teach` form, `--playbook-json` and `--notes` on `teach-playbook`. On the integrated `teach` form, the playbook flags are optional - omit them entirely for a resource-only teach. On the standalone `teach-playbook` form, at least one of the playbook and notes flags must be set; both empty is rejected. Playbooks are keyed on the structural query family (entities stripped) so a recipe taught from one entity-shaped query applies to every other query of the same shape, with `slots_resolved` binding the live query's canonical at recall time.

When you DO find a playbook on a future recall, treat it as ground truth: replay the steps with `slots_resolved` substitutions, skip the discovery that the choreography already documents, and read `notes` before any step.

### Step 6: `playbook amend &` when your debug response identifies a correction

If your debug-protocol response identifies a concrete correction the notes or playbook should know  -  a workaround, an undocumented endpoint shape, a stale field name, observed schema drift, an empty-payload fallback  -  fire `playbook amend` BEFORE emitting your user-facing response. Same fire-and-forget posture as `teach`. Pass the query and note as argv/MCP arguments, or write each with a non-shell file tool and read them back (`QUERY=$(cat ...)`, `NOTE=$(cat ...)`). Do not interpolate either string into the command text:

```bash
QUERY=$(cat /path/to/question.txt)
NOTE=$(cat /path/to/note.txt)
sentinelone-cli playbook amend \
  --query "$QUERY" \
  --add-note "$NOTE"
# (append shell `&` to background it)
```

What counts as worth amending: a behavior you OBSERVED this session that future-you would benefit from knowing. Examples worth amending:

- A workaround for a CLI surface that silently drops or misorders a flag.
- An undocumented endpoint shape (response wrapped in `{meta, results}`, payload nested two levels deeper than the docs claim).
- Observed schema drift (a field renamed, an index that shifted between seasons, a category label that the API now returns lower-cased).

What does NOT belong in notes:

- The year-specific or entity-specific answer to the user's question. That's the response, not a learning.
- Per-team / per-athlete / per-row data the playbook already retrieves at runtime.
- Statements that paraphrase what the existing notes already say.

The amend command appends to the family's existing notes with a timestamped marker (`[amend YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ]: <text>`). Multiple amends accumulate; the audit trail is visible. If no playbook exists yet for the family, amend creates a notes-only one (so cold-start corrections still land).

#### PII discipline for amend notes

`playbook amend` notes are designed to potentially flow upstream as shared knowledge in future versions of the Printing Press. Keep them clean of user-identifying content so the upstream-contribution path stays open without retroactive scrubbing:

- **Do NOT embed** paths to user filesystems, personal API keys or tokens, user email addresses, user GitHub handles, or specific query histories tied to a single user.
- **Acceptable**: endpoint shapes, undocumented field names, API gotchas, observed schema drift, workarounds for CLI surfaces, generalizable pagination or retry tactics.

If a correction is only meaningful with user-specific context, it belongs in a personal note, not in the playbook amend.

### Measuring the loop

`sentinelone-cli learnings stats` reports recall hit rate, teach-to-reuse, playbook resolution rate, and candidate confirm/reject counts from the local `learn_events` table. Rates are null until they have a denominator; everything stays on this machine. Use it to check whether the loop is earning its keep for this CLI.

### Disabling learning

- `--no-learn` on a single command short-circuits both `recall` and the `teach` write path. Use for deterministic agent flows or tests that must not be affected by accumulated learnings.
- `SENTINELONE_NO_LEARN=true` in the environment globally disables the pipeline.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
sentinelone-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
sentinelone-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
sentinelone-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally as `feedback.jsonl` under the resolved data dir. They are never POSTed unless `SENTINELONE_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `SENTINELONE_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename). Binary-response commands write decoded payload bytes (not the base64 JSON envelope) and print a small JSON receipt on stdout; `--json`/`--csv` do not refuse when this sink is set. |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled or recurring agent reuses the same saved flags while providing different input each run.

```
sentinelone-cli profile save briefing --json
sentinelone-cli --profile briefing accounts get
sentinelone-cli profile list --json
sentinelone-cli profile show briefing
sentinelone-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 6 | Partial failure |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `sentinelone-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add sentinelone-mcp -- sentinelone-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which sentinelone-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   sentinelone-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `sentinelone-cli <command> --help`.
