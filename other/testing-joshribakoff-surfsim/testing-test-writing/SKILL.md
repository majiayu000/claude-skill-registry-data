name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write minimal, focused tests that cover core user flows and primary workflows without over-testing during development. Use this skill when deciding what to test, writing behavior-focused tests, naming test cases clearly, mocking external dependencies, or keeping tests fast. Apply when completing feature implementation and adding strategic tests, testing critical paths rather than edge cases, or deferring edge case testing to dedicated testing phases.
---

## When to use this skill:

- When deciding what tests to write during feature development
- When identifying core user flows and primary workflows to test
- When writing behavior-focused tests instead of implementation tests
- When naming test cases with clear descriptions of what is being tested
- When mocking databases, APIs, file systems, and external services
- When keeping unit tests fast (milliseconds) for frequent execution
- When deferring edge case and error state testing
- When completing a feature and adding strategic tests at logical completion points
- When avoiding over-testing non-critical utilities
- When balancing test coverage with development velocity
- When ensuring tests describe expected outcomes in their names
