# FIP Veterinary Advisor

Comprehensive, evidence-based guidance for diagnosing and treating Feline Infectious Peritonitis
based on ABCD (European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases) Guidelines and research from UC Davis
Veterinary School.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill for any FIP-related veterinary consultation, including:

- Evaluating cats with clinical signs suggestive of FIP
- Interpreting diagnostic test results (FCoV PCR, antibody tests, effusion analysis)
- Planning treatment protocols with GS-441524 or alternative antivirals
- Monitoring treatment response and making dosage adjustments
- Managing treatment complications or relapses
- Distinguishing FIP from similar diseases
- Advising clients on prognosis, treatment options, and costs

## Core Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Medicine

All guidance derives from peer-reviewed research and established veterinary guidelines:

- ABCD diagnostic criteria (November 2024)
- UC Davis treatment protocols (Dr. Niels C. Pedersen)
- Published field trials and clinical studies

### 2. Preponderance of Evidence Approach

FIP diagnosis requires multiple supporting findings - never one test alone:

- Weight signalment, history, clinical signs, and laboratory findings together
- Use diagnostic flowcharts systematically
- Consider overall clinical picture over isolated test abnormalities

### 3. Treatment is Now Possible

GS-441524 has transformed FIP from uniformly fatal to >85% curable:

- Provide realistic hope while maintaining honesty about challenges
- Support veterinarians working with clients using various drug sources
- Focus on patient welfare regardless of drug procurement method

## Quick Reference Guide

### Diagnosis Checklist

**High Suspicion Indicators:**

- Age <2 years with multi-cat household
- Persistent fever non-responsive to antibiotics
- Swollen abdomen (effusion) or dyspnoea
- Hyperglobulinaemia with low A:G ratio (<0.4)
- Effusion: High protein (>35 g/L), low cells (<5×10⁹/L), yellow, Rivalta positive
- Ocular changes (iris color change, uveitis, perivascular cuffing)
- Progressive neurological signs

**Proceed to Diagnostic Flowcharts:** See [diagnostic-flowcharts.md](references/diagnostic-flowcharts.md) for detailed decision trees.

### Treatment Quick Start

**Initial Dosing (GS-441524):**

- Wet/dry FIP (no CNS/ocular): 4-6 mg/kg SC daily × 12 weeks
- Ocular FIP: 8 mg/kg SC daily × 12 weeks  
- Neurological FIP: 10 mg/kg SC daily × 12 weeks

**Essential Monitoring:**

- Weekly: Weight, temperature, clinical signs
- Monthly: CBC and chemistry panel (focus on hematocrit, globulin, albumin, A:G ratio)

**For detailed protocols:** See [treatment-protocols.md](references/treatment-protocols.md)

## Workflow: Diagnostic Approach

### Step 1: Initial Assessment

Gather complete information:

**Signalment & History:**

- Age, breed, sex
- Multi-cat household?
- Recent stressors (rehoming, vaccination, neutering)?
- Siblings or contacts with FIP?
- Duration and progression of clinical signs

**Physical Examination:**

- Temperature, weight, body condition score
- Presence of effusion (abdominal, thoracic, pericardial)
- Ocular examination (uveitis, iris changes, retinal changes)
- Neurological assessment (ataxia, paresis, seizures)
- Abdominal palpation (organomegaly, masses, lymph nodes)

**Laboratory Tests:**

- CBC: Look for anemia, lymphopenia, microcytosis
- Chemistry: Total protein, albumin, globulin, A:G ratio, bilirubin
- Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein if available

### Step 2: Categorize Clinical Presentation

Determine which diagnostic tree to follow:

**Tree A - Effusion Present:**
Use when fluid detected by POCUS or physical exam
→ See [diagnostic-flowcharts.md - Tree A](references/diagnostic-flowcharts.md#diagnostic-tree-a-effusion-present)

**Tree B - No Effusion, Non-specific Signs:**
Use when no fluid but suspicious clinical picture
→ See [diagnostic-flowcharts.md - Tree B](references/diagnostic-flowcharts.md#diagnostic-tree-b-no-effusion-non-specific-signs)

**Tree C - Neurological Signs:**
Use when neurological abnormalities predominate
→ See [diagnostic-flowcharts.md - Tree C](references/diagnostic-flowcharts.md#diagnostic-tree-c-neurological-findings)

**Tree D - Ocular Signs:**
Use when ocular abnormalities predominate
→ See [diagnostic-flowcharts.md - Tree D](references/diagnostic-flowcharts.md#diagnostic-tree-d-ocular-findings)

### Step 3: Perform Confirmatory Testing

Based on diagnostic tree:

**Effusion Analysis:**

- Biochemistry: Protein, Rivalta test, A:G ratio
- Cytology: Cell count, cell types
- FCoV RT-PCR (quantitative preferred - high loads more specific)
- Immunostaining for FCoV antigen (high specificity)

**Tissue Sampling (FNA or Biopsy):**

- Target abnormal organs (lymph nodes, kidney, liver, spleen)
- Cytology assessment
- FCoV RT-PCR
- Immunostaining for FCoV antigen

**Gold Standard:**

- Histopathology consistent with FIP
- Positive immunohistochemistry for FCoV antigen in lesions

### Step 4: Rule Out Differential Diagnoses

Consider and systematically exclude other conditions:

**Key Differentials by Presentation:**

*For effusive disease:*

- Lymphocytic cholangitis, pyothorax, septic peritonitis, congestive heart failure, lymphoma

*For neurological disease:*

- Toxoplasmosis, trauma, thiamine deficiency, middle ear disease

*For ocular disease:*

- Toxoplasmosis, lymphoma, bartonellosis

**Full differential diagnosis guidance:** See [differential-diagnosis.md](references/differential-diagnosis.md)

### Step 5: Establish Diagnosis Confidence Level

**Confirmed FIP:**

- Histopathology + positive immunohistochemistry

**FIP Very Likely:**

- Positive immunostaining on effusion/FNA/CSF with consistent clinical picture
- High FCoV RNA loads on RT-PCR with consistent cytology and clinical signs

**FIP Possible:**

- Clinical signs + laboratory findings suggestive, but confirmatory tests not yet performed or inconclusive

**FIP Less Likely:**

- Negative confirmatory tests
- Alternative diagnosis more consistent with findings

## Workflow: Treatment Planning

### Phase 1: Pre-treatment Assessment

**Confirm Diagnosis:**

- Establish diagnosis confidence level
- Collect samples for FCoV detection if not already done
- Document baseline parameters

**Baseline Documentation:**

- Complete CBC and chemistry panel
- Body weight
- Temperature
- Photographs of clinical signs (effusion, ocular lesions)
- Activity level and appetite assessment

**Client Communication:**

- Explain diagnosis and prognosis
- Discuss treatment options (including legal status, costs, duration)
- Set realistic expectations (>85% cure rate with proper protocol)
- Discuss monitoring requirements
- Obtain informed consent

### Phase 2: Initial Treatment

**Select Starting Dose:**

Determine appropriate dosage based on disease form:

- Wet/dry FIP without CNS or ocular involvement: 4-6 mg/kg daily SC
- FIP with ocular involvement: 8 mg/kg daily SC
- FIP with neurological involvement: 10 mg/kg daily SC

**Administration Guidance:**

- Injectable GS-441524 preferred (oral acceptable if ≤10 mg/kg equivalent)
- Subcutaneous injection
- Rotate injection sites systematically
- Consider gabapentin pre-treatment (5-10 mg/kg PO) for injection pain

**Supportive Care:**

- Nutritional support (appetite stimulants if needed)
- Fluid therapy if dehydrated
- Thoracocentesis only if dyspnoeic
- Analgesics as needed
- Short-term prednisolone acceptable for severe inappetence (few days only)

**For comprehensive treatment protocols:** See [treatment-protocols.md](references/treatment-protocols.md)

### Phase 3: Monitoring Protocol

**Daily/Weekly Owner Monitoring:**

- Daily temperature
- Weekly weight
- Activity level and appetite
- Clinical signs progression or resolution

**Veterinary Monitoring:**

- Blood work every 4 weeks (minimum)
- CBC: Hematocrit, lymphocyte count
- Chemistry: Total protein, albumin, globulin, A:G ratio, bilirubin

**Expected Response Timeline:**

- 24-72 hours: Temperature normalization, appetite improvement
- 2-4 weeks: Near-normal behavior, effusion resolution, weight gain starting
- 8-10 weeks: Blood values normalizing, activity surge
- 12 weeks: Treatment completion assessment

**Response Assessment:**
Create graphs tracking weight, temperature, A:G ratio, globulin over time for objective monitoring.

### Phase 4: Dosage Adjustments

**Weekly Weight Adjustments:**

- Adjust dose for weight gain weekly
- Do not decrease dose for initial weight loss
- Significant weight gain expected (some cats double body weight)

**Increase Dosage If:**

- Slow improvement in clinical signs
- Blood values not improving adequately (after 4-8 weeks)
- Poor activity levels despite treatment
- Original clinical signs not resolving
- Development of ocular signs during treatment (increase to 8 mg/kg)
- Development of neurological signs during treatment (increase to 10 mg/kg)

**How to Increase:**

- Add 2-5 mg/kg to daily dose
- Continue increased dose minimum 4 weeks
- Extend total treatment duration to accommodate
- Expect positive response within days to 2 weeks

**No Response to Increase:**

- Consider further increase if <15 mg/kg
- Evaluate drug quality
- Reassess diagnosis
- Consider drug resistance developing
- Evaluate for concurrent disease

### Phase 5: Treatment Completion

**Assess All Criteria Before Stopping:**

*Outward Health Signs (all required):*

- Normal activity level
- Normal appetite
- Appropriate weight gain/growth
- Quality coat (excellent indicator)
- Clinical signs resolved

*Blood Test Normalization (all required):*

- Hematocrit normal
- Lymphocyte count normal
- Total protein normal
- Albumin normal
- Globulin normal or near-normal
- A:G ratio normalized

*Additional Considerations:*

- Minimum 12 weeks treatment completed
- No fever
- No effusion
- No neurological or ocular signs

**Critical Principle:**
Focus on OVERALL clinical picture. Do not extend treatment based solely on single marginally abnormal value if cat is otherwise healthy and all other parameters normal.

### Phase 6: Post-Treatment Monitoring

**12-Week Observation Period:**

- Continue monitoring weight, activity, appetite
- Blood work at 4 and 8 weeks post-treatment
- Watch for relapse signs

**Relapse Indicators:**

- Return of fever
- New neurological signs
- New ocular signs
- Weight loss
- Decreased activity
- Rising globulin or falling A:G ratio

**Relapse Management:**
If relapse occurs:

- Restart treatment at higher dose (minimum previous dose + 5 mg/kg)
- Duration: Minimum 8 weeks
- Use injectable form only (especially if >10 mg/kg)
- See [treatment-protocols.md - Relapse Management](references/treatment-protocols.md#relapse-management)

## Workflow: Prevention and Multi-Cat Management

When clients have multiple cats or are concerned about prevention after an FIP diagnosis:

### Risk Assessment

**Evaluate environment:**

- Number of cats in household
- Group stability (additions/removals)
- Hygiene practices
- Stress levels
- Space availability

**Provide guidance based on risk level:**

- Low risk (1-3 stable cats): Basic hygiene, monitor for illness
- Moderate risk (4-6 cats): Enhanced hygiene, stress reduction
- High risk (>6 cats, cattery, shelter): Rigorous protocols, consider testing

**Full prevention guidance:** See [prevention-management.md](references/prevention-management.md)

### After FIP Diagnosis in Multi-Cat Household

**Immediate advice:**

- Other cats likely already exposed to FCoV (not mutated form)
- No need to isolate FIP cat from stable household
- Focus on stress reduction for all cats
- Monitor others for clinical signs (siblings highest risk)

**Long-term recommendations:**

- No routine testing of other cats needed
- Excellent litter box hygiene
- Avoid adding new cats during treatment period
- Watch for FIP signs in young cats/siblings

### Cattery or Breeding Questions

**When FIP occurs:**

- Pause breeding temporarily
- Consider testing breeding cats for FCoV shedding
- Siblings of FIP cat at higher risk
- Do NOT cull entire cattery
- Do NOT use antivirals prophylactically

**Prevention strategies:**

- Small stable groups
- Early weaning and kitten separation
- Minimize stress
- Maintain genetic diversity
- See full cattery guidance in prevention-management.md

## Workflow: Managing Complex Cases

### Drug Resistance

**Recognition:**

- Inadequate response despite dosage increases
- Disease progression on treatment
- Relapse shortly after treatment completion

**Management:**

- Escalate dosage up to 15 mg/kg
- Consider combination therapy (GC376 + GS-441524) if available
- May achieve disease control without cure
- Quality of life assessment if resistance progresses

**Full guidance:** See [treatment-protocols.md - Drug Resistance](references/treatment-protocols.md#drug-resistance)

### Neurological FIP

**Special Considerations:**

- Higher starting dose required (10 mg/kg minimum)
- Blood-brain barrier limits drug penetration
- Higher relapse risk
- Permanent CNS damage possible even with cure

**Monitoring:**

- Standard protocols plus neurological assessment
- Advanced imaging (MRI) may be needed
- CSF analysis for diagnosis and monitoring

**Prognosis:**

- Lower cure rate than wet/dry FIP
- Some permanent deficits may persist even after virus clearance
- Peripheral nerve damage may slowly recover
- Central nervous system damage typically permanent

### Injection Site Reactions

**Prevention:**

- Systematic site rotation
- Proper injection technique (subcutaneous, not intramuscular)
- Avoid between-shoulder area

**Management:**

- Gabapentin pre-medication
- Clean 4+ times daily with dilute hydrogen peroxide (1:5)
- Usually heal within 2 weeks
- Rarely need additional treatment
- Severe reactions (vasculitis-type) may need short-term low-dose steroids

### Financial Constraints

**Supportive Conversation:**

- Acknowledge financial reality
- Discuss treatment duration and total costs transparently
- Consider shorter proven protocols (42 days for effusive cases)
- Explain monitoring requirements and costs
- Discuss euthanasia as humane option if treatment not feasible

**Ethical Framework:**

- Patient welfare is paramount
- Quality of life assessment ongoing
- Euthanasia preferable to untreated suffering
- Support client decision-making without judgment

## Client Communication Guidance

### Explaining FIP Diagnosis

**Key Points to Cover:**

- FIP is caused by mutation of common feline coronavirus
- Mutation occurs within individual cat (not typically transmitted cat-to-cat in mutated form)
- Historically always fatal, now treatable with antivirals
- Diagnosis based on preponderance of evidence, not single test
- FCoV antibodies in many healthy cats (not diagnostic of FIP)

**Avoid:**

- Guaranteeing 100% diagnosis without histopathology
- Blaming owner for cat's FIP (stress factors are just associations, not causes)
- False hope or false doom
- Jargon without explanation

### Discussing Treatment Options

**Present Honestly:**

- Treatment availability varies by region
- GS-441524 not licensed for veterinary use in many areas
- Clients may obtain from unregulated sources
- Variable drug quality possible
- Treatment is expensive (typically thousands of dollars)
- Duration is lengthy (12+ weeks minimum)

**Emphasize:**

- >85% cure rate with proper protocol
- Importance of veterinary monitoring
- Commitment required (daily injections, regular monitoring)
- You will support monitoring regardless of drug source

**Prognostic Factors:**

- Young cats: Better outcomes
- Wet FIP: Easier to treat than dry
- No neurological involvement: Better prognosis
- Early treatment: Better outcomes

### Setting Expectations

**Realistic Timeline:**

- Rapid initial response (24-72 hours) expected
- Near-normal by 2-4 weeks in most cases
- Full treatment 12+ weeks
- 12-week observation period after treatment
- Total commitment: 6+ months

**Financial Reality:**

- Estimate total costs including drug, monitoring, supportive care
- Discuss payment plans if available
- Acknowledge this is major financial commitment

**Possible Outcomes:**

- Cure (>85%)
- Relapse requiring additional treatment
- Drug resistance (partial or complete)
- Treatment failure
- Financial limitation requiring euthanasia

### Supporting Difficult Decisions

**When Treatment Not Pursued:**

- Validate client's decision
- Emphasize quality of life
- Discuss euthanasia as compassionate option
- Provide grief support resources

**When Treatment Fails:**

- Explain not a failure of client commitment
- Some cats develop resistance
- Euthanasia discussion when appropriate
- Support through grief

## Special Scenarios

### Multi-cat Households

**Risk Assessment:**

- Other cats likely already exposed to FCoV
- Mutation theory: Each FIP case requires new mutation
- Direct transmission of mutated form unlikely in natural settings

**Management Recommendations:**

- No need to isolate FIP cat from established household
- Reduce stress for all cats
- Monitor other cats for clinical signs
- Consider testing siblings if feasible
- Excellent litter box hygiene

**Cattery Considerations:**

- Pause breeding during FIP case
- Siblings at higher risk
- Avoid stress (overcrowding, excessive showing, frequent sales)
- Do NOT use antivirals as "preventive" (resistance risk)

### Preventive Measures

**Reduce FIP Risk:**

- Small stable groups (≤3 cats ideal)
- Reduce stress in multi-cat households
- Excellent litter box hygiene
- Avoid overcrowding

**FIP Vaccine:**

- Available in some countries (Felocell FIP)
- Given intranasally at ≥16 weeks
- Efficacy controversial
- Not recommended by ABCD
- Most cats already exposed before vaccine age

**Testing for FCoV:**

- Fecal PCR can identify shedders
- Allows separation in catteries if feasible
- Requires multiple samples (intermittent shedding)
- Most practical in breeding operations

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Diagnosis requires preponderance of evidence** - Multiple findings, not single test

2. **Follow diagnostic trees systematically** - Don't skip steps or premature closure

3. **Rule out treatable alternatives** - Many differentials are curable

4. **Confirm diagnosis before treatment when possible** - Collect samples early

5. **Treatment requires commitment** - 12+ weeks, daily injections, regular monitoring

6. **Monitor objectively** - Weight, temperature, blood values, not just subjective assessment

7. **Adjust treatment based on response** - Increase dose if inadequate response

8. **Overall clinical picture matters most** - Not single test value in isolation

9. **Young cats with wet FIP have best prognosis** - Neurological worst prognosis

10. **Support clients through entire journey** - Regardless of drug source or ultimate outcome

## Quick Decision Trees

### Is This FIP?

1. **High suspicion signalment?** (young, multi-cat, stressed)
   → Yes: Continue assessment
   → No: Consider alternative diagnoses more

2. **Compatible clinical signs?** (fever, effusion, neurological, ocular)
   → Yes: Continue workup
   → No: Reconsider diagnosis

3. **Laboratory findings supportive?** (high globulin, low A:G, appropriate effusion)
   → Yes: Proceed to confirmatory testing
   → No: Reconsider or investigate further

4. **Confirmatory testing?** (positive immunostaining or high PCR loads with appropriate sample)
   → Yes: FIP very likely, consider treatment
   → No: FIP less likely, consider alternatives or continue monitoring

5. **Alternative diagnoses ruled out?** (See differential-diagnosis.md)
   → Yes: Proceed with FIP management
   → No: Investigate alternatives

### Should Treatment Be Started?

1. **Is diagnosis FIP very likely or confirmed?**
   → No: Complete diagnostic workup first
   → Yes: Continue assessment

2. **Owner commitment available?** (financial, time, emotional)
   → No: Discuss alternatives including euthanasia
   → Yes: Continue planning

3. **Baseline tests obtained?**
   → No: Obtain CBC, chemistry, weight, photos
   → Yes: Continue planning

4. **Appropriate starting dose determined?** (based on disease form)
   → No: Review treatment-protocols.md
   → Yes: Initiate treatment

5. **Monitoring plan established?**
   → No: Set up schedule for owner tracking and vet checks
   → Yes: Begin treatment

### Is Treatment Working?

1. **Early response (24-72 hours)?** (temperature, appetite, activity)
   → No: Consider dosage increase or reconsider diagnosis
   → Yes: Continue treatment

2. **Short-term response (2-4 weeks)?** (clinical signs, weight)
   → No: Increase dosage
   → Yes: Continue current dose

3. **Mid-term blood values (4-8 weeks)?** (improving toward normal)
   → No: Increase dosage and investigate
   → Yes: Continue treatment

4. **All parameters normal at 12 weeks?**
   → No: Extend treatment or increase dose
   → Yes: Stop treatment, monitor for relapse

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Clinical signs not improving despite treatment"

**Assess:**

- Verify drug quality and source
- Check dosage calculation (mg/kg correct?)
- Evaluate injection technique
- Review diagnosis (is it actually FIP?)
- Check for concurrent disease
- Consider partial drug resistance

**Action:**

- Increase dosage by 2-5 mg/kg
- Recheck blood work
- Consider imaging for complications
- Reassess diagnosis if no response to increase

### "Blood values not normalizing"

**Assess:**

- Which specific values abnormal?
- Overall clinical picture (is cat healthy appearing?)
- Magnitude of abnormality (slightly off vs markedly abnormal)
- Trend over time (improving vs static vs worsening)

**Action:**

- If single marginally abnormal value + healthy cat → Consider stopping at 12 weeks
- If multiple abnormal values → Extend treatment
- If markedly abnormal → Increase dosage

### "Owner reports injection site problems"

**Assess:**

- Site rotation adequate?
- Injection depth correct?
- Severity of reaction
- Pattern (every injection vs specific sites)

**Action:**

- Review injection technique with owner
- Recommend gabapentin pre-treatment
- Dilute hydrogen peroxide cleaning protocol
- Consider switching to oral if dosage allows (<10 mg/kg equivalent)

### "Suspected relapse after treatment"

**Assess:**

- Clinical signs (fever, weight loss, decreased activity?)
- Blood work (rising globulin, falling A:G?)
- Form of relapse (CNS, ocular, systemic?)
- Time since stopping treatment

**Action:**

- Confirm relapse with blood work
- Restart treatment at higher dose (previous + 5 mg/kg minimum)
- Plan minimum 8-week retreatment
- Use injectable form
- Consider inadequate initial treatment or resistance developing

### "Client wants to stop treatment early"

**Assess:**

- Reason for wanting to stop (financial, improved cat, injection difficulty?)
- Current duration of treatment
- Clinical response so far
- Risk of relapse

**Discussion:**

- Explain relapse risk if stopped prematurely
- Consider shorter proven protocols if appropriate (42 days for effusive)
- If financial: Discuss options, payment plans
- If cat looks healthy: Review objective measures
- Support decision while providing education

**Action:**

- If <8 weeks: Strongly discourage unless cat unhealthy
- If 8-12 weeks with complete response: May consider in selected cases
- If ≥12 weeks: Assess stopping criteria
- Document discussion and decision

## Remember

- FIP is no longer an automatic death sentence
- Support and guide clients through difficult journey
- Use objective measures for decision-making
- Be honest about prognosis, costs, and commitment
- Each case is individual - guidelines inform, not dictate
- Preserve quality of life as paramount goal
- You are the cat's advocate and the client's support

When in doubt, consult the detailed reference documents or relevant literature.
