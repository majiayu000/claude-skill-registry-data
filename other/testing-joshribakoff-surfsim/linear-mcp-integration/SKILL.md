# Linear MCP Integration

Use Linear MCP server functions to interact with Linear's project management system.

## Prerequisites

- Linear MCP server configured and available
- Authentication: Linear API token configured in MCP server
- Access to Linear workspace

## Quick Start

**Get issue details:**
```typescript
mcp_Linear_get_issue({
  id: "LIN-123",
  includeRelations: true // get related/blocking issues
})
```

**List issues:**
```typescript
mcp_Linear_list_issues({
  team: "Engineering",
  state: "In Progress"
})
```

## Usage Patterns for PR Review

### Fetch Issue Requirements

**Step 1: Extract Issue ID from PR**
- Look for Linear issue references in PR title/body (e.g., `LIN-123`, `[LIN-123]`)
- Extract issue identifier

**Step 2: Get Issue Details**
```typescript
mcp_Linear_get_issue({
  id: "LIN-123", // extracted from PR
  includeRelations: true // to get blocking/related issues
})
```

**Step 3: Extract Requirements**
- Parse issue `description` for acceptance criteria
- Check `labels` for feature tags
- Review `comments` for additional context
- Check `relatedTo` and `blocks` for dependencies

### Validate PR Completeness

Check if PR addresses all requirements:
1. Get issue details with `mcp_Linear_get_issue`
2. Parse issue description for:
   - Acceptance criteria (checkboxes, numbered lists)
   - Feature requirements
   - Technical specifications
3. Compare PR changes against requirements
4. Identify gaps or missing implementations

### Update Issue Status

After PR review:
- Use `mcp_Linear_update_issue` to:
  - Update status (e.g., "In Review", "Ready for QA")
  - Add comments with review findings
  - Link related issues

### Create Review Comments

Post review findings to Linear:
```typescript
mcp_Linear_create_comment({
  issueId: "LIN-123",
  body: "## PR Review Summary\n\n✅ Requirements met: ...\n⚠️ Gaps identified: ..."
})
```

## Common Workflows

### PR Review with Issue Validation

1. Extract issue reference from PR title/body
2. Fetch issue using `mcp_Linear_get_issue`
3. Parse requirements from issue description
4. Review PR changes against requirements
5. Create comment on Linear issue with review summary
6. Update issue status if needed

### Issue Discovery

1. List issues for a team/project using `mcp_Linear_list_issues`
2. Filter by state, assignee, or labels
3. Get details for relevant issues
4. Cross-reference with PR changes

## Integration with GitHub

When reviewing PRs:
1. Extract Linear issue references from PR title/body
2. Use Linear MCP to fetch issue requirements
3. Validate PR changes against requirements
4. Post review findings back to Linear issue
