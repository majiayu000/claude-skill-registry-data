name: Global Tech Stack
description: Understand and apply the n8n community node tech stack including TypeScript strict mode, Node.js v22+, n8n-workflow package, and build tools. Use this skill when setting up new n8n node projects, configuring package.json, writing TypeScript with strict mode, running build or dev scripts, configuring ESLint with n8n rules, setting up Jest tests, or preparing packages for npm publishing. Apply when making decisions about runtime, dependencies, or tooling in n8n node development.
