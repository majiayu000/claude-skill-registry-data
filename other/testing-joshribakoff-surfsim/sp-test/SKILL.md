description: Test skills with subagents before deployment to resist rationalization
---

Invoke the superpowers:testing-skills-with-subagents skill when creating or editing skills, before deployment, to verify they work under pressure and resist rationalization.

Use this to apply RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle to process documentation by running baseline without skill, writing to address failures, iterating to close loopholes.

```
Skill("superpowers:testing-skills-with-subagents")
```
