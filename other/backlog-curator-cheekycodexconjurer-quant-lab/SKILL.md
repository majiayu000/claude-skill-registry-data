  short-description: Curate backlog items
---

## Purpose
Turn discoveries and gaps into actionable backlog items.

## Steps
1. Review Action Log, patterns, and mapping gaps.
2. Add or refine backlog items with scope and rationale.
3. De-duplicate and prioritize (Now/Next/Later).
4. Link to evidence (files, ADRs, logs) when possible.

## Output
- Update `.agent-docs/memory/BACKLOG.md`.

## Guardrails
- Do not auto-create new skills; propose them in `PATTERNS.md`.
