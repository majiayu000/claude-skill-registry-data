### Step 1: Define Planning Parameters

**Required inputs:**

| Field       | Purpose                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Time period | Month, quarter, year              |

### Step 2: Establish Content Pillars

**Content pillar framework:**

```markdown
A content pillar is a core topic that:

- Aligns with your expertise
- Matters to your audience
- Supports business goals
- Can generate 10+ pieces of content
```

**Pillar template:**

| Pillar     | Description       | Audience Need            | Content Ratio |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| [Pillar 1] | [Core topic area] | [What problem it solves] | [X%]          |
| [Pillar 2] | [Core topic area] | [What problem it solves] | [X%]          |
| [Pillar 3] | [Core topic area] | [What problem it solves] | [X%]          |
| [Pillar 4] | [Core topic area] | [What problem it solves] | [X%]          |

**Example (for a web dev agency):**

| Pillar       | Description                    | Audience Need       | Ratio |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----- |
| Performance  | Page speed, Core Web Vitals    | Sites are too slow  | 30%   |
| Modern Stack | Next.js, headless CMS, APIs    | Tech choices        | 25%   |
| Conversion   | UX, landing pages, A/B testing | Sites don't convert | 25%   |
| Case Studies | Client wins, results           | Social proof        | 20%   |

### Step 3: Set Publishing Cadence

**Cadence by platform:**

| Twitter/X  | Daily   | 2-3/day     | 5+/day     |

## Validation

Before completing:

- [ ] Content pillars defined (3-5 pillars)
- [ ] Publishing cadence is sustainable
- [ ] All platforms accounted for
- [ ] Key dates mapped
- [ ] Monthly themes assigned
- [ ] Content types balanced
- [ ] Repurposing opportunities identified
- [ ] Status tracking system included

## Error Handling

- **No clear goals**: Ask for top 3 content marketing objectives (traffic, leads, engagement).
- **Too many platforms**: Recommend focusing on 2-3 platforms initially until capacity grows.
- **Unsustainable cadence**: Reduce frequency or suggest batching and repurposing.
- **No team capacity info**: Ask how many hours per week available for content creation.
- **Missing key dates**: Prompt for product launches, company events, and industry dates.
