# Customer Interview Synthesis

Question bank and synthesis templates for product discovery interviews.

## Interview Question Bank

### Problem Discovery

```markdown
- "Walk me through the last time you [did X]..."
- "What's the hardest part about [doing X]?"
- "Why is that hard?" (ask 3x - dig deeper)
- "What have you tried to solve this?"
- "What happened when you tried that?"
```

### Current Solution Analysis

```markdown
- "How do you handle [X] today?"
- "How often do you do this?"
- "What would happen if you couldn't do this?"
- "How much time/money does this cost you?"
```

### Switching Signals

```markdown
- "Have you looked for other solutions?"
- "What would make you switch?"
- "What's stopping you from switching now?"
```

### Value Discovery

```markdown
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"
- "What would that be worth to you?"
- "Who else cares about this problem?"
```

## Interview Synthesis Template

```markdown
## Interview: [Customer Name/Segment]

### Pain Intensity: [1-5]
- 1: Mild annoyance
- 3: Significant friction
- 5: "Hair on fire" problem

## Interview Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead Do |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Leading questions | Confirms bias | Ask open-ended, follow "why" |
| Hypothetical pricing | People lie about future | Ask about current spending |
| Feature requests | Solutions, not problems | Dig for underlying need |
| Small sample | Anecdotes ≠ patterns | Require 5+ signals minimum |

## Output

After interviews, synthesize patterns across multiple conversations to identify:
- Common pain points (frequency + intensity)
- Willingness to pay signals
- Current solutions being "fired"
