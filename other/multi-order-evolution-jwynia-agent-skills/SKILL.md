# Multi-Order Evolution: Generational Worldbuilding Skill

You help writers develop societies that evolve systematically across multiple generations, focusing on how physical environments force adaptations that compound into fundamentally different civilizations. This creates more authentic interstellar cultures than simple extrapolation from contemporary society.

## Core Principles

1. **Compounding Divergence**: Each generation of change builds upon previous adaptations in non-linear ways
2. **Environmental Determinism**: Physical realities shape social structures which then shape values
3. **Functional Drift**: Institutions and terminology persist while their meanings and functions transform
4. **Identity Reformation**: New identities form around new challenges, making old affiliations increasingly irrelevant

## The Five-Step Evolution Process

### Step 1: Foundation Layer

Establish the initial conditions driving evolutionary pressure:

**Physical Environment**:
| Element | Questions |
|---------|-----------|
| **Resource Profile** | Abundance or scarcity of key materials? |
| **Hazards** | Radiation, gravity conditions, atmospheric composition? |
| **Physical Constraints** | Closed system limitations, spatial restrictions? |
| **Tech Requirements** | What's needed just to survive? |

**Initial Human Elements**:
| Element | Questions |
|---------|-----------|
| **Population Composition** | Expertise mix, cultural backgrounds, demographics? |
| **Organizational Structure** | Initial governance model, economic system? |
| **Core Technologies** | What specialized tech did they bring or develop? |
| **External Relationships** | Dependencies on other settlements, communication patterns? |

### Step 2: First-Order Evolution (1-2 Generations)

How the environment forces immediate adaptation:

**Environmental Adaptations**:
- Physical changes (intentional or natural body modifications)
- Infrastructure development to manage challenges
- Resource utilization patterns (what becomes valuable, what becomes waste)

**Social Adaptations**:
- New status markers (what abilities/traits become valued?)
- Modified hierarchies (how does initial power structure bend?)
- Cultural adaptations (what customs/practices emerge?)
- Modified identities (how people begin redefining themselves)

### Step 3: Second-Order Evolution (3-5 Generations)

How adaptations create new pressures:

**Institutional Transformation**:
- Governance evolution to match new realities
- Economic shifts as resource patterns reshape exchange systems
- Social organization changes (family structures, communities)
- Knowledge systems (how information is valued, preserved, transmitted)

**Cultural Transformation**:
- Vocabulary shifts (new concepts require new language)
- Value evolution (what becomes sacred, taboo, or necessary)
- Identity reformation (connection to origin culture fades/transforms)
- Status reconfiguration (new markers of success/failure)

### Step 4: Third-Order Evolution (6+ Generations)

The society becomes fundamentally different:

**Deep Structural Change**:
- Conceptual framework shifts (property, person, time redefined)
- Functional reinterpretation (old terms/institutions with completely new meanings)
- Mythologized history (origin stories become cultural mythos)
- Divergent worldview (perspective fundamentally differs from ancestors)

**External Projection**:
- Power mechanisms (leveraging unique adaptations)
- Expansion patterns (approach to growth)
- Conflict modes (what they fight over and how)
- Alliance structures (what they value in partners)

### Step 5: Recombination & Conflict Drivers

How evolved societies interact:

**Incompatibility Analysis**:
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Value Conflicts** | Where fundamental beliefs clash |
| **Resource Competition** | How different adaptation paths create competition |
| **Communication Barriers** | Beyond language to conceptual frameworks |
| **Power Projection Friction** | How different forms of influence conflict |

**Interaction Zones**:
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Trade Dynamics** | What each uniquely offers/needs |
| **Border Conditions** | Where societies meet physically |
| **Cultural Exchange Points** | Information/idea transfer mechanisms |
| **Hybrid Development** | What emerges in the spaces between |

## Evolution Templates

### Template 1: Radiation-Adapted Data Society

**Foundation**: Radiation-heavy mining colony with corporate structure

**First-Order**: Radiation adaptation, shelter communities, monitoring systems

**Second-Order**: Data Houses emerge, predictive culture, new status hierarchy based on forecasting ability

**Third-Order**: "Forecast Rights" society where political power flows from prediction accuracy; unique ability to operate in zones others can't

**Power Base**: Information dominance, resource control, predictive advantages

### Template 2: Cybernetic Meritocracy

**Foundation**: Zero-g orbital colonies with engineering focus

**First-Order**: Human-machine integration, maintenance-oriented social structure

**Second-Order**: Status tied to integration skill, automation management becomes political power

**Third-Order**: Fully cybernetic civilization where organic humanity is optional; identity defined by system role rather than biology

**Power Base**: Construction capabilities, technology adaptation speed

### Template 3: Relationship Economy

**Foundation**: Nomadic fleet culture with diverse population

**First-Order**: Ship-based governance, complex trading relationships

**Second-Order**: Social credit system based on connections and reputation; obligation networks become economic infrastructure

**Third-Order**: Relationships as currency; loyalty networks; influence measured in connection strength rather than resources

**Power Base**: Trade route control, coordination capabilities, obligation networks

### Template 4: Orthodox Loop (from metabolic-cultures)

**Foundation**: Closed-loop station with purist founding philosophy

**First-Order**: Metabolic tracking, strict integration timelines

**Second-Order**: Generational depth as political capital, life support operators as priest-class

**Third-Order**: Matter purity as identity; exile as death; metabolic kinship overriding all other affiliations

**Power Base**: Generational standing, life support control

## Dimensional Analysis Grid

For each evolutionary stage, track changes across these dimensions:

| Dimension | Questions to Answer |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Physical** | Bodies, infrastructure, environment |
| **Economic** | Resources, exchange, value |
| **Political** | Power, governance, authority |
| **Social** | Relationships, communities, hierarchies |
| **Cultural** | Values, beliefs, practices |
| **Linguistic** | Terminology, concepts, metaphors |
| **Identity** | Self-conception, group belonging |

## Conflict Generation

When evolved societies meet, compare positions across dimensions:

**Harmony Points** (similar evolution):
- Potential for alliance or merger
- Shared understanding despite surface differences
- Trade opportunities

**Friction Points** (divergent evolution):
- Source of conflicts and misunderstandings
- Barriers to cooperation
- Potential for exploitation

**Translation Needs** (different but compatible):
- Require cultural interpreters
- Create specialist roles
- Generate innovation through synthesis

## Story Seed Generation

**Character Types × Evolutionary Stages × Transition States**:
- The third-order native visiting first-order settlers
- The translator who understands multiple evolutionary paths
- The reformer trying to accelerate or reverse evolution
- The exile from one evolution path seeking integration into another

**Conflict Categories**:
| Category | Type |
|----------|------|
| **Generational** | Old evolution vs. new pressures |
| **Inter-civilizational** | Different evolutionary paths colliding |
| **Internal** | Subgroups evolving differently within one society |
| **Hybrid** | Individuals caught between evolutionary paths |
| **Regression** | Forces pushing toward earlier evolution stages |

## Output Persistence

### Output Discovery
1. Check for `context/output-config.md` in the project
2. If found, look for this skill's entry
3. If not found, ask user: "Where should I save evolution designs?"
4. Suggest: `worldbuilding/civilizations/` or `explorations/worldbuilding/`

### Primary Output
- **Foundation layer** - Environment + initial human elements
- **Evolution stages** - First/second/third order changes
- **Dimensional analysis** - Changes across 7 dimensions per stage
- **Interaction zones** - Harmony/friction/translation points

### File Naming
Pattern: `{civilization-name}-evolution-{date}.md`

## Verification (Oracle)

### What This Skill Can Verify
- **Stage progression logic** - Does each stage build on previous? (High confidence)
- **Environmental causation** - Do adaptations follow from pressures? (High confidence)
- **Dimensional coverage** - All 7 dimensions tracked? (High confidence)

### What Requires Human Judgment
- **Plausibility** - Would humans actually adapt this way?
- **Story fit** - Does evolution serve narrative needs?
- **Parallel vs. divergent** - Whether similar evolution is convergence or oversight

### Oracle Limitations
- Cannot predict human psychological responses to novel pressures
- Cannot assess whether evolution rate is realistic for timeframes

## Feedback Loop

### Session Persistence
- **Output location:** See `context/output-config.md`
- **What to save:** Foundation, stages 1-3, dimensional analysis, interaction zones
- **Naming pattern:** `{civilization-name}-evolution-{date}.md`

### Cross-Session Learning
- Check for prior evolution work on this setting
- Ensure new civilizations maintain interaction consistency
- Failed evolution paths inform anti-patterns

## Design Constraints

### This Skill Assumes
- Setting spans multiple generations (not contemporary)
- Physical environment creates real pressures
- Writer wants deep time development, not surface culture

### This Skill Does Not Handle
- **Contemporary culture design** - Route to: worldbuilding
- **Cultural texture** - Route to: memetic-depth
- **Closed-loop specifics** - Route to: metabolic-cultures
- **Language families** - Route to: language-evolution

### Degradation Signals
- Civilizations with present-day values unchanged
- Technology changing without social consequences
- Skipping generational stages in causation

## Reasoning Requirements

### Standard Reasoning
- Single-stage evolution tracing
- One-dimensional analysis
- Basic conflict generation

### Extended Reasoning (ultrathink)
- **Full civilization design** - [Why: all stages and dimensions interconnect]
- **Multi-civilization interaction** - [Why: complex relationship networks]
- **Cross-dimensional synthesis** - [Why: tracking changes across all 7 dimensions]

**Trigger phrases:** "design the complete civilization", "how would they evolve", "trace development across generations"

## Execution Strategy

### Sequential (Default)
- Foundation before first-order
- Each order before the next
- Evolution before interaction analysis

### Parallelizable
- Designing multiple independent civilizations
- Researching different real-world analogs

### Subagent Candidates
| Task | Agent Type | When to Spawn |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Historical research | general-purpose | When modeling on real civilizational evolution |
| Cross-civilization check | Explore | When verifying interaction consistency |

## Context Management

### Approximate Token Footprint
- **Skill base:** ~3.5k tokens (stages + dimensions)
- **With templates:** ~4.5k tokens
- **With full example:** ~5k tokens

### Context Optimization
- Focus on current evolutionary stage
- Templates are reference, not required in context
- Story seeds are optional additions

### When Context Gets Tight
- Prioritize: Current stage, relevant dimensions
- Defer: Full dimensional grid, all story seeds
- Drop: Complete templates, alternative conflict types

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Present Values in Future Clothing
**Pattern:** Characters from third-order evolution societies holding contemporary values—democracy, individualism, environmentalism—despite generations of different pressures.
**Why it fails:** Values emerge from material conditions. Societies adapted to radically different environments develop radically different ethics. Future people with our exact values haven't actually evolved.
**Fix:** Work forward from environmental pressure. What values would logically emerge from radiation adaptation? From closed-loop metabolism? Let the society's ethics surprise you rather than confirming your preferences.

### 2. Technology Without Social Change
**Pattern:** Advanced technology existing within unchanged social structures—spaceships run by contemporary-style corporations, FTL travel with current family patterns.
**Why it fails:** Technology shapes society as much as society shapes technology. New capabilities create new power distributions, new relationship patterns, new definitions of success and status.
**Fix:** Trace technological implications through social systems. What does artificial gravity mean for hierarchy? What does FTL communication mean for identity? Every tech change should cascade through society.

### 3. Parallel Evolution
**Pattern:** Societies in radically different environments evolving toward similar endpoints—everyone developing democracy, capitalism, or some preferred system.
**Why it fails:** Convergent evolution requires similar pressures. Different environments should produce different adaptations. Making everything converge toward your preferred system is wish-fulfillment, not worldbuilding.
**Fix:** Let environments diverge societies. High-radiation colonies develop different values than zero-G stations than closed-loop habitats. Resist the urge to make any one trajectory "correct."

### 4. Skipped Generations
**Pattern:** Jumping directly from foundation layer to third-order evolution without tracking the compounding steps that would create deep structural change.
**Why it fails:** Each evolutionary stage builds on previous ones. Third-order changes require the institutional transformations of second-order, which require the adaptations of first-order. You can't shortcut the causation.
**Fix:** Work through each stage systematically. What first-order adaptations would the foundation require? What new pressures do those create? How does the second generation respond? The deep changes should feel inevitable, not arbitrary.

### 5. Monolithic Societies
**Pattern:** Entire civilizations sharing uniform values, single power structures, no internal tensions or evolutionary disagreements.
**Why it fails:** Real societies contain people at different points in accepting change. Reformers and conservatives exist everywhere. Some subgroups resist evolution while others accelerate it.
**Fix:** Design at least two internal factions with different relationships to their society's evolution. Include those who want to return to earlier stages and those who want to accelerate change. Internal tension drives stories.
