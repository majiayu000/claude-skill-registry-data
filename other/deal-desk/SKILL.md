# Renewal Deal Desk Skill

## When to Use
- Structuring pricing proposals, multi-year offers, or incentive bundles on renewals.
- Coordinating finance, legal, and exec approvals for discounts or contractual changes.
- Ensuring negotiation notes, approvals, and commitments are logged for auditability.

## Framework
1. **Pricing Guardrails** – define floor rates, uplift expectations, unit economics, and exception thresholds.
2. **Approval Ladder** – map discount bands and non-standard terms to required approvers and SLAs.
3. **Packaging Toolkit** – list common offer constructs (multi-year, success-based, bundling) with positioning guidance.
4. **Documentation Standards** – specify data needed in each deal (business case, ROI, churn risk, competitor intel).
5. **Post-Deal Review** – feed outcomes into analytics to refine guardrails and coach GTM teams.

## Templates
- Deal intake form capturing pricing ask, rationale, and risk level.
- Approval matrix cheat sheet with contact info and expected turnaround.
- Commercial summary sheet for exec briefings.

## Tips
- Partner early with finance to forecast impact of concessions.
- Keep revision history accessible to avoid conflicting promises.
- Sync final terms back to CRM/billing immediately to prevent renewal errors.
