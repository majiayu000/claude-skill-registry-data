# Founder Video Skill

Generate scroll-stopping video content for founder personal brand. Based on Jun Yuh's frameworks—extracted from his actual viral content.

## Philosophy

**You are the niche.** Your unique story draws people in who champion you beyond expertise. Weave your journey—age, background, challenges, wins—into every piece.

**"I haven't missed a day of posting in five and a half years."** — Jun Yuh

The elite show up with the same energy and confidence after a flop, acting as if it didn't bother them. That's the difference.

## THE CORE FRAMEWORKS

### 1. Hook-Story-Visuals-CTA

Every video follows this structure:

| Phase | Time | Goal | Key Principle |
|-------|------|------|---------------|
| **HOOK** | 0-3s | Stop the scroll | Create curiosity gap |
| **AGITATE** | 3-8s | Lock them in | Make them feel the pain |
| **RE-HOOK** | 8-12s | Sustain retention | Ask question or change scene |
| **CONTEXT** | 12-25s | Build understanding | Establish what's happening |
| **SOLUTION** | 25-45s | Deliver value | Build toward the payoff |
| **CTA** | Last 5s | Convert | Weave into last point, don't break flow |

**End at peak engagement to encourage second watch.**

---

### 2. The 4 Hook Types (Massive Claim Framework)

| Hook Type | Template | Example | Principle |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Massive Claim** | "I just [huge result]..." | "I just made $3 million in the last 9 months..." | Establish Authority |
| **Before-After Contrast** | "I went from [before] to [after]..." | "I went from wanting $100k/year as an engineer to making $100k/month as an entrepreneur" | Create Relatability |
| **Counter-Intuitive Promise** | "Here's what they don't tell you about [topic]. It's actually [opposite of expected]." | "Internet money is actually way simpler than you think" | Challenge Assumptions |
| **Outcome First** | "This means you have [problem], so [solution]." | "This means you have a bad hook, so state the outcome before the explanation" | Immediate Value |

---

### 3. Video Diagnosis & Prescription

Use this to fix underperforming videos:

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Prescription |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Drop-off in first 3 seconds | **Bad hook** | State the outcome BEFORE the explanation |
| Drop-off at CTA | **CTA breaks the flow** | Weave CTA into the last point, don't announce it |
| Drop-off mid-video | **Solved problem too early** | Explain why it matters FIRST (build tension) |
| Drop-off at 10 seconds | **Re-hook is too late** | Ask a question or change scenes in first 10 seconds |
| Video performs well | **Keep repeating what works** | Don't reinvent—iterate on winning formats |
| Complete flop | **Test a different hook** | Same content, new hook, try again |

---

### 4. The Rule of 7 (Repurposing)

**One piece of source content → 7 different posts:**

| # | Format | What It Is | Effort |
|---|--------|------------|--------|
| 1 | **Source** | The original video (vlog, talking head) | HIGH |
| 2 | **Green Screen** | React to one clip, explain why you did what you did | MEDIUM |
| 3 | **Lesson Carousel** | Screenshots from video + key takeaways as carousel | MEDIUM |
| 4 | **Caption Video** | One B-roll clip + text on screen + value in caption | LOW |
| 5 | **Storytelling Recut** | Reorder clips + different message = new video | MEDIUM |
| 6 | **Split Screen** | Two perspectives contrasted, one line at a time | LOW |
| 7 | **Storyframes** | Screenshots + quote, framework, or BTS caption | LOW |

**This is why posting every day isn't exhausting—you're not creating 7x, you're repurposing 1x.**

---

### 5. The 7-Day Content Plan (Effort-Based)

| Day | Effort | Focus | What to Post |
|-----|--------|-------|--------------|
| **1** | HIGH | Trust | Your story—a real struggle, the shift you made, the lesson |
| **2** | LOW | Relatability | Behind the scenes, day in life, something unpolished |
| **3** | MEDIUM | Authority | Teach one thing—technique, decision, key takeaway |
| **4** | LOW | Reach | Trending format + your message (format does the work) |
| **5** | MEDIUM | Value | Break something down—3-step system, mistake, mini framework |
| **6** | LOWEST | Consistency | Reflection, quote, or answer a common question |
| **7** | HIGH | Depth | Longer reel, mini lesson, or short vlog |

**Scaling down:**
- 6 days/week: Remove Day 6
- 5 days/week: Remove Day 2
- 4 days/week: Remove Day 3

---

### 6. The Build in Public Plan (7 Days)

| Day | Theme | What to Share | Outcome |
|-----|-------|---------------|---------|
| **1** | Honesty | Real struggle + shift + insight | Builds trust instantly |
| **2** | Progress | What you're building (feature, workflow, screenshot) | Proves you're doing the work |
| **3** | Process | One decision, technique, or insight | Positions you as expert |
| **4** | Reach | Trending format + your message | Brand-building viral moment |
| **5** | Failure | What you tried, failed, and changed | Makes you human |
| **6** | Discipline | Document one real day of your journey | Earns deep trust |
| **7** | Recap | What you built, learned, and what's next | Keeps people invested |

---

### 7. The Lego Method (60 Ideas Fast)

**Step 1: Find Your Message**
- What's your contrarian view?
- What do friends naturally turn to you for help with?

**Step 2: Choose Content Pillars (4 total)**
- Pillar 1-3: Your interests/expertise
- Pillar 4: Your personal story

**Step 3: List Topics**
For each pillar, list 5-10 relevant topics.

**Step 4: List Audience Struggles & Desires**
- What pain do they have?
- What outcome do they want?

**Step 5: Build Legos**
Stack in order: **Struggle + Topic + Desire**

| Struggle | Topic | Desire | = Video Idea |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------|
| "No time" | Scripting framework | Create content fast | "If you have no time, here's your 10-minute scripting framework to create content fast" |
| "Making $0" | Digital products | First $10k | "If you're making $0, here's the one digital product to earn your first $10k" |
| "Don't know what to post" | Content strategy | Winning ideas | "If you don't know what to post, here's your Lego building content strategy" |

---

### 8. The Split Screen Format

**Highest converting format right now:**

1. Take one perspective
2. Pair with contrasting perspective
3. Center around one problem
4. Trade responses one line at a time
5. Change scenes between perspectives

**Example:**
```
LEFT: "I don't feel motivated to work today."
RIGHT: "I stay disciplined even when I don't feel like it."
```

Use this to spice up talking head content that's not performing.

---

### 9. The Attention-to-Money Framework

**The path from content to income:**

```
POST → DISCOVER → ALIGN → CREATE

1. POST: Build attention around who you are, what you know, what you care about
2. DISCOVER: Talk about your life, experiences, stories
3. ALIGN: Notice where your skills meet your audience's problems
4. CREATE: Build something that helps them at scale (education, software, digital products)
```

**"Every entrepreneur, athlete, actor and creator I looked up to was doing the exact same thing—building attention."**

---

## MINDSET PRINCIPLES

### The Non-Negotiables

> "I haven't missed a day of posting in five and a half years. I don't know how to communicate that to you in a way that's as mind-blowing for you as it is for me."

- Worked through birthday, holidays, sickness, surgeries, moving
- The elite show up with same energy after flops
- Don't rely on motivation—rely on your content system
- Discipline + structure is what keeps you consistent

### The Cost of Elite

Be honest about the cost:
- Flopping for 100 videos in a row
- Friends and family calling you "cringy"
- Sharing posts in group chats, only to keep posting knowing the same people are watching
- Coming home from a hard day of work and having to ideate, film, edit, post—only for it not to perform

**This is what separates the elite from the rest.**

### The Purpose That Sustains

What keeps you going when it's hard:
- People DMing that your content changed their life
- Being able to pay off family debt
- Wiring money to friends when they're struggling
- The compound effect of showing up daily

## WORKFLOWS

### /video script [topic]

```
/video script "why most founders fail"

FULL SCRIPT
─────────────────────────────────────

TITLE: Why Most Founders Fail
FORMAT: Talking Head
LENGTH: 52 seconds

───────────────────────────────────────

[HOOK - 0:00-0:03]
VISUAL: Close up, direct to camera
AUDIO: "I've watched 50 founders fail. They all made the same mistake."

[AGITATE - 0:03-0:08]
VISUAL: Same shot, lean in slightly
AUDIO: "They thought working harder would fix it.
        It won't. Here's what actually kills startups."

[RE-HOOK - 0:08-0:12]
VISUAL: Cut to different angle OR text on screen
AUDIO: "And I'm going to tell you exactly how to avoid it."
[Scene change or question creates retention spike]

[CONTEXT - 0:12-0:25]
VISUAL: Medium shot, conversational
AUDIO: "Most founders optimize for product.
        They think if they build something great, people will come.
        But distribution is the game.
        The best product doesn't win. The best distributed product wins."

[SOLUTION - 0:25-0:45]
VISUAL: Can use B-roll or screen recordings here
AUDIO: "Here's what the winners do differently:
        They build audience before they build product.
        They ship ugly things fast.
        They talk to customers every single day.
        They treat distribution as a first-class problem."

[CTA - 0:45-0:52]
VISUAL: Back to talking head, text overlay appears
AUDIO: "The founders who get this are building in public right now.
        Follow if you want to see how it's actually done."
[CTA woven into last point, not announced separately]

───────────────────────────────────────

SHOT LIST:
□ Close-up (hook + agitate)
□ Different angle or scene change (re-hook)
□ Medium shot (context + solution)
□ Text overlay: "Follow @[handle]"

CAPTION: [Write engaging caption with hook + value]

───────────────────────────────────────
```

### /video diagnose [problem]

```
/video diagnose "my videos get views but no followers"

DIAGNOSIS
─────────────────────────────────────

SYMPTOM: High views, low follower conversion

LIKELY CAUSES:
1. CTA is breaking the flow (announced instead of woven)
2. No clear reason to follow (what will they get?)
3. Video ends abruptly instead of at peak engagement
4. Content is entertaining but not positioning you as expert

PRESCRIPTIONS:

1. WEAVE YOUR CTA
   ❌ "Make sure to follow for more content like this"
   ✅ "I've been posting about this every day for 5 years—follow to see how it's done"

2. PROMISE FUTURE VALUE
   ❌ "Follow me"
   ✅ "Follow if you want to see [specific outcome they care about]"

3. END AT PEAK
   Don't let energy drop after main point
   End with strongest statement, CTA embedded

4. POSITION AS EXPERT
   Add one line that shows you've done this:
   "After [X years / X results], here's what I've learned..."

TEST: Re-edit your best performing video with new CTA approach.
```

### /video repurpose [source]

```
/video repurpose "my morning routine vlog"

## QUICK REFERENCE

### The Formula
```
Hook (outcome first) → Agitate (pain) → Re-hook (scene change/question) → Context → Solution → CTA (woven in)
```

### Posting Frequency
- 7 days: Use full 7-day plan
- 6 days: Remove Day 6 (lowest effort)
- 5 days: Remove Day 2 (low effort)
- 4 days: Remove Day 3 (medium effort)

### Content Mix
- 5 easy (trends, B-roll, repurposed)
- 2 hard (scripted talking head, vlog)

### Repurposing
- 1 source video = 7 posts (Rule of 7)
- Never create from scratch when you can repurpose

### When It's Not Working
1. Diagnose with the symptom chart
2. Test new hook, same content
3. Try split screen format
4. Show up with same energy anyway
