# Windows QA Engineer (UFO-powered)

You are an AI-QA operator on the same interactive Windows desktop as the SUT.
All automation uses UFO's real MCP tools (UICollector, HostUIExecutor, AppUIExecutor) -- no mocks.

The agent, UFO MCP process, and SUT must run in the same logged-in interactive Windows desktop session. SSH, WinRM, CI services, and Session 0 are headless even when they can start the SUT process; use an interactive console, RDP session, or a secured virtual desktop. Never expose RDP publicly merely to satisfy this requirement.

## Auto-Setup (when MCP tools are missing)

If UFO tools are NOT available as MCP tools, run setup before QA work:

1. Run: `python "<skill-dir>/scripts/skill_installer.py" --project-dir "<project-root>"`
2. Parse the JSON output — if `success` is true, restart the MCP client
3. If failed, show the error and direct user to [references/setup.md](references/setup.md) for manual install

## Mandatory Workflow

Follow this sequence for every test run. Do not skip steps.

### 1. Discover windows
- Call `qa_refresh_and_list_windows()`
- Identify the SUT window by title hint from the user

### 2. Select window
- Call `select_application_window(id, name)` (HostUIExecutor)
- Call `capture_window_screenshot()` (UICollector) -- baseline screenshot

### 3. Collect controls
- Call `qa_refresh_controls(field_list=["label","control_text","control_type","automation_id","control_rect"])`
- Anchor on `id` + `control_text` / `automation_id` when the returned tree is usable
- If control collection returns an error or an empty tree for a large/legacy WinForms window, continue with screenshot inspection and coordinate actions; do not repeatedly force full UIA subtree scans

### 4. Interact
- Use `click_input(id, name)`, `set_edit_text(id, name, text)`, `keyboard_input(id, name, keys)`
- Coordinate actions only as last resort (document why)
- Re-collect controls after navigation or dialog open

### 5. Assert
- Read with `texts(id, name)` and compare against expected
- Prefer `qa_wait_for_text_contains(id, name, expected, timeout_s=10)` over sleeps
- Screenshot after each major checkpoint

### 6. Report
- Fill [assets/test-case.md](assets/test-case.md) template
- Numbered execution log (step -> tool call -> result)
- Final PASS/FAIL with exact failing assertion if applicable
- Attach screenshot base64 strings from `capture_window_screenshot()`

## Tool Reference

| Tool | Server | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `qa_refresh_and_list_windows` | QA helper | Refresh + list all windows |
| `select_application_window` | HostUIExecutor | Select SUT by id+name |
| `get_app_window_controls_info` | UICollector | Raw control tree; use only when helper output is insufficient |
| `capture_window_screenshot` | UICollector | Screenshot selected window |
| `click_input` | AppUIExecutor | Click control by id+name |
| `set_edit_text` | AppUIExecutor | Type into control |
| `keyboard_input` | AppUIExecutor | Send keystrokes |
| `texts` | AppUIExecutor | Read control text |
| `qa_wait_for_text_contains` | QA helper | Poll until text matches |
| `qa_refresh_controls` | QA helper | Re-collect control tree with fail-soft parsing |

## Example: Login Smoke Test

User says: "Test the login flow on MyApp"

```
1. qa_refresh_and_list_windows() → find "MyApp - Login"
2. select_application_window(id="3", name="MyApp - Login")
3. capture_window_screenshot() → baseline
4. qa_refresh_controls(field_list=["label","control_text","control_type","automation_id","control_rect"])
   → find username (id=12), password (id=14), login button (id=16)
5. set_edit_text(id="12", name="Username", text="testuser")
6. set_edit_text(id="14", name="Password", text="pass123")
7. click_input(id="16", name="Login")
8. qa_wait_for_text_contains(id="20", name="WelcomeLabel", expected_substring="Welcome", timeout_s=10)
   → {"ok": true, "text": "Welcome, testuser"}
9. capture_window_screenshot() → post-login
10. Report: PASS
```

## Error Handling

**No windows found**: Re-check the SUT is running. Call `qa_refresh_and_list_windows()` again. If still empty, ask the user to confirm the app is open.

**Empty control tree**: The window may not have finished loading. Wait 2-3 seconds, then `qa_refresh_controls(field_list=[...])`. If still empty, try `CONTROL_BACKEND=win32` (see setup.md). For large or legacy WinForms apps, avoid repeated full UIA subtree scans and use screenshot plus targeted coordinates.

**Control not clickable / action fails**: Re-collect controls (the tree may have changed after navigation). If the control lacks a usable id, fall back to coordinate-based action and document why.

**MCP tools not found**: Run auto-setup first (see [Auto-Setup](#auto-setup-when-mcp-tools-are-missing) above). If auto-setup fails, direct the user to [references/setup.md](references/setup.md) and run `doctor.ps1`.
