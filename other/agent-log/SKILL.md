description: Use this skill to maintain an agent log in .agents/log, a decision journal shared by the developer and agents. Trigger when the user explicitly asks to use agent-log or record/update an agent log entry; when planning, implementing, or finalizing a significant feature in a repo with an existing .agents/log; or before non-trivial changes or questions in areas covered by existing entries. Never initialize .agents/log unless the user explicitly asks for an agent log.

# Agent Log

Maintain `.agents/log/` — a version-controlled journal of product and engineering decisions, tradeoffs, and directions, co-owned by the developer and agents. Entries capture *why* — the reasoning that code and git history cannot recover.

## Layout

- `.agents/log/index.md` — index of all entries
- `.agents/log/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` — one entry per feature or standalone decision

Initialize `.agents/log/` only when the user explicitly asks — by invoking this skill or directly requesting an agent log. If `.agents/log/` is absent otherwise, do not create it, even when a plan is approved. When initializing, create `.agents/log/index.md` with the table header from Index Format; create an entry only if the current task records a decision.

## Entry Format

```markdown
---
title: Human-readable decision or feature title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
status: wip | done
related_paths:
  - src/feature-area/
  - src/shared/specific-file.ts
---

# Human-readable decision or feature title

## Background

Context needed to understand the problem. Link related entries as
[title](YYYY-MM-DD-other-entry.md).

## Problem

What is being solved and why now.

## Questions & Answers

Clarifying questions asked and the user's answers. Open questions stay
here until resolved.

## Decision

The chosen design. Concrete: file paths, type signatures, data shapes.
Mark examples with ✅ (do) and ❌ (don't) — the canonical notation for all
entries. Use Mermaid diagrams only when they clarify the decision.

## Tradeoffs & Alternatives

Rejected options and why. This section prevents re-litigating decisions
later.

## Implementation Plan

Phases or steps, when the entry starts as a plan draft.

## Verification

How success is checked, as a checklist:

- [ ] Tests, behaviors, or measurable criteria
- [ ] Manual checks that need a human

## Implementation Notes

Dated notes appended during and after implementation: deviations from
the plan, discoveries, test outcomes.
```

Make the level-one heading the first content after frontmatter and match its text
exactly to the frontmatter `title`. Use only one level-one heading. Omit sections
that have no content. Keep entries short and decision-focused — do not document
what the code or git history already states.

## Index Format

`index.md` holds a single markdown table:

```markdown
| Date | Name | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-07 | [Dark mode toggle](2026-07-07-dark-mode-toggle.md) | done |
```

Use the linked name as the short description. Keep paths, tradeoffs, and other details in the entry itself. Keep entries sorted newest first. Update the index whenever an entry is created, renamed, or its status changes.

## Recall: Read Before You Write

Before drafting a plan or making non-trivial changes in a repo that has `.agents/log/`:

1. Read `index.md`.
2. Read entries whose `related_paths` overlap the files or areas being touched. If the index seems stale, grep entry frontmatter directly. Also grep entry bodies for 2-3 keywords from the request — path overlap alone misses cross-cutting decisions.
3. Surface relevant prior decisions to the user before asking clarifying questions — they may answer the questions or reshape the request.
4. Treat `done` entries as binding constraints unless the active conversation shows that the agent set the status without explicit user finalization; recover that lifecycle error under Done entries are frozen. Treat `wip` entries as current direction. When entries conflict, the newer one wins.
5. If the requested change contradicts an explicitly finalized `done` entry, surface the conflict to the user before proceeding. Resolution is a new entry recording the new decision and linking the old one, not a silent edit.
6. When answering questions about existing behavior or past decisions, cite the relevant entry by title and link.

Read `index.md` and matching entries with the agent's normal file-reading tool. When the log is large, narrow down which entries to read first:

```bash
rg -l "src/feature-area|src/shared/file.ts" .agents/log   # entries touching the paths being changed
rg -il "keyword1|keyword2" .agents/log                    # cross-cutting decisions by topic
```

Replace the placeholders with the touched paths and 2-3 keywords from the user request, then read the matching entries in full — do not rely on match snippets alone.

## Write Workflow

### 1. Ask clarifying questions before implementation

Before drafting a plan or entry for a significant feature or architectural change:

- Run the recall steps above and surface relevant prior decisions first.
- Ask specific clarifying questions about scope, behavior, and tradeoffs that the request, the codebase, and prior entries do not already answer. Prefer 2-4 concrete options per question and mark a recommended one.
- Use the agent's structured question tool when available; otherwise ask a short numbered list in plain text.
- Wait for answers before designing. Record the questions and answers in the entry's Questions & Answers section.
- Do not manufacture questions for trivial scope — zero questions is fine when the request is already unambiguous.

### 2. Draft when a plan is approved

When the user approves a plan for a significant feature or architectural change,
continue an existing `wip` entry for that feature. Create a draft entry as the
first implementation step only when no same-feature entry exists — and only if
`.agents/log/` already exists or the user explicitly asked for an agent log.
Otherwise skip the entry; plan approval alone never initializes the log.

- Name it `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` using today's date.
- Set `status: wip` and fill `related_paths` with the folders and files the plan touches.
- Seed the sections from the plan text; record clarifying questions and answers already given.
- Add it to `index.md`.

### 3. Update freely while WIP

While `status: wip`, the entry is a living document. Update it as decisions change, questions get answered, and the plan deviates. Keep `related_paths` in sync with where the work actually landed.

- Treat the entry as belonging to the feature, not to one prompt, turn, review
  round, or implementation pass.
- Continue the same entry across follow-up prompts, diff comments, fixes, and
  revised choices while the user is still working on the same feature.
- Treat the same thread, overlapping paths, and one continuing uncommitted diff
  as strong evidence of feature continuity. A thread may still contain multiple
  features when the user clearly starts a separate one.

### 4. Finalize when the feature is done

Finalize only when the user explicitly says the feature is finished or directly
asks to finalize the entry.

- Do not infer finalization from passing tests, completing implementation,
  returning a final response, committing or merging code, or reaching the end
  of a turn.
- If the user appears to wrap up the feature without mentioning the log, ask
  once whether to finalize it. Keep it `wip` while waiting for the answer.

- Make sections reflect what was actually built; record final deviations and test outcomes in Implementation Notes.
- Check off Verification items that passed. Do not mark an entry `done` while items are unchecked — either verify them, or record in Implementation Notes that the user explicitly waived them.
- Set `status: done` and update `index.md`.

### 5. Done entries are frozen

A `done` entry is frozen only after explicit user finalization. Never edit an
explicitly finalized entry. Later work that overrides it gets a new entry that
links back to the old one.

If an agent set `status: done` without explicit user confirmation and the
feature is still active, treat that as a lifecycle error: restore the entry and
index status to `wip`, then continue the same entry. Do not create a compensating
entry. Preserve user-authored content while correcting the status and continuing
the living document.

## Handling Feedback During Implementation

| Feedback | Action |
|---|---|
| Clarification question | Answer, citing entries; no log change |
| Bug in the implementation | Fix it; note it in Implementation Notes |
| Missed constraint or edge case | Append to Questions & Answers and Verification; adjust Decision if it changes |
| Refinement, reversal, or diff comment for the current feature | Update the `wip` entry, even when it replaces an interim choice |
| Clearly separate feature or standalone decision | Create a new entry linking related prior entries |

When uncertain which type it is, state your assumptions and ask.

## Guidelines

- Log significant features, architectural changes, and directional decisions. Skip trivial fixes, refactors with no decision content, and routine chores.
- The developer edits entries too: never delete or rewrite user-authored content in an entry — append or ask.
- Keep one entry per user-defined feature or standalone decision. Do not split a feature by prompt, review turn, implementation pass, or revised choice.
- Continue the active `wip` entry for follow-up prompts on the same feature. Create a new entry only when the user clearly starts a separate feature or the work is an independent decision that can stand without the active feature. Ask when unclear.
- Do not put secrets, credentials, or private user data in entries.
