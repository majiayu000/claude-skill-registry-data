# Code Quality SKILL

## Clean Code Principles

- **SRP:** Single Responsibility Principle
- **DRY:** Don't Repeat Yourself
- **KISS:** Keep It Simple, Stupid

## Type Safety

- **NO `any` types** (Python: use `typing.Any` sparingly)
- Use utility types, generics, type guards

## Function Guidelines

- Max length: 50 lines
- Max cyclomatic complexity: 10
- Clear naming (verb + noun)
