# VideoDB Skill

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/videodb` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# VideoDB Skill Perception + memory + actions for video, live streams, and desktop sessions. Use this skill when you need to:

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: 1) Desktop Perception, 2) Video ingest + stream, 4) Timeline editing + generation, 5) Live streams (RTSP) + monitoring, Common inputs, Common outputs.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- You need video or audio perception, indexing, search, or timeline editing from files, URLs, desktop sessions, or live streams.
- The task involves timestamps, searchable evidence, subtitles, clips, overlays, or real-time monitoring alerts.
- You want one workflow that combines ingestion, understanding, retrieval, and media actions.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Video and audio perception, indexing, and editing. Ingest files/URLs/live streams, build visual/spoken indexes, search with timestamps, edit timelines, add overlays/subtitles, generate media, and create real-time alerts.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `scripts/ws_listener.py` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `reference/api-reference.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Export in terminal (before starting Claude): export VIDEODBAPI_KEY=your-key
2. Project .env file: Save VIDEODBAPI_KEY=your-key in the project's .env file
3. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
4. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
5. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
6. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
7. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Setup

When the user asks to "setup videodb" or similar:

### 1. Install SDK

```bash
pip install "videodb[capture]" python-dotenv
```

If `videodb[capture]` fails on Linux, install without the capture extra:

```bash
pip install videodb python-dotenv
```

### 2. Configure API key

The user must set `VIDEO_DB_API_KEY` using **either** method:

- **Export in terminal** (before starting Claude): `export VIDEO_DB_API_KEY=your-key`
- **Project `.env` file**: Save `VIDEO_DB_API_KEY=your-key` in the project's `.env` file

Get a free API key at https://console.videodb.io (50 free uploads, no credit card).

**Do NOT** read, write, or handle the API key yourself. Always let the user set it.

#### Imported: 1) Desktop Perception

- Start/stop a **desktop session** capturing **screen, mic, and system audio**
- Stream **live context** and store **episodic session memory**
- Run **real-time alerts/triggers** on what's spoken and what's happening on screen
- Produce **session summaries**, a searchable timeline, and **playable evidence links**

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @videodb to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @videodb against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @videodb for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @videodb using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Canonical prompts (examples)

- "Start desktop capture and alert when a password field appears."
- "Record my session and produce an actionable summary when it ends."
- "Ingest this file and return a playable stream link."
- "Index this folder and find every scene with people, return timestamps."
- "Generate subtitles, burn them in, and add light background music."
- "Connect this RTSP URL and alert when a person enters the zone."

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.
- Keep provenance, source commit, and imported file paths visible in notes and PR descriptions.
- Point directly at the copied upstream files that justify the workflow instead of relying on generic review boilerplate.
- Treat generated examples as scaffolding; adapt them to the concrete task before execution.
- Route to a stronger native skill when architecture, debugging, design, or security concerns become dominant.



## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/videodb`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: 3) Index + search (timestamps + evidence)

- Build **visual**, **spoken**, and **keyword** indexes
- Search and return exact moments with **timestamps** and **playable evidence**
- Auto-create **clips** from search results

#### Imported: Quick Reference

### Upload media

```python
# URL
video = coll.upload(url="https://example.com/video.mp4")

# YouTube
video = coll.upload(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID")

# Local file
video = coll.upload(file_path="/path/to/video.mp4")
```

### Transcript + subtitle

```python
# force=True skips the error if the video is already indexed
video.index_spoken_words(force=True)
text = video.get_transcript_text()
stream_url = video.add_subtitle()
```

### Search inside videos

```python
from videodb.exceptions import InvalidRequestError

video.index_spoken_words(force=True)

# search() raises InvalidRequestError when no results are found.
# Always wrap in try/except and treat "No results found" as empty.
try:
    results = video.search("product demo")
    shots = results.get_shots()
    stream_url = results.compile()
except InvalidRequestError as e:
    if "No results found" in str(e):
        shots = []
    else:
        raise
```

### Scene search

```python
import re
from videodb import SearchType, IndexType, SceneExtractionType
from videodb.exceptions import InvalidRequestError

# index_scenes() has no force parameter — it raises an error if a scene
# index already exists. Extract the existing index ID from the error.
try:
    scene_index_id = video.index_scenes(
        extraction_type=SceneExtractionType.shot_based,
        prompt="Describe the visual content in this scene.",
    )
except Exception as e:
    match = re.search(r"id\s+([a-f0-9]+)", str(e))
    if match:
        scene_index_id = match.group(1)
    else:
        raise

# Use score_threshold to filter low-relevance noise (recommended: 0.3+)
try:
    results = video.search(
        query="person writing on a whiteboard",
        search_type=SearchType.semantic,
        index_type=IndexType.scene,
        scene_index_id=scene_index_id,
        score_threshold=0.3,
    )
    shots = results.get_shots()
    stream_url = results.compile()
except InvalidRequestError as e:
    if "No results found" in str(e):
        shots = []
    else:
        raise
```

### Timeline editing

**Important:** Always validate timestamps before building a timeline:
- `start` must be >= 0 (negative values are silently accepted but produce broken output)
- `start` must be < `end`
- `end` must be <= `video.length`

```python
from videodb.timeline import Timeline
from videodb.asset import VideoAsset, TextAsset, TextStyle

timeline = Timeline(conn)
timeline.add_inline(VideoAsset(asset_id=video.id, start=10, end=30))
timeline.add_overlay(0, TextAsset(text="The End", duration=3, style=TextStyle(fontsize=36)))
stream_url = timeline.generate_stream()
```

### Transcode video (resolution / quality change)

```python
from videodb import TranscodeMode, VideoConfig, AudioConfig

# Change resolution, quality, or aspect ratio server-side
job_id = conn.transcode(
    source="https://example.com/video.mp4",
    callback_url="https://example.com/webhook",
    mode=TranscodeMode.economy,
    video_config=VideoConfig(resolution=720, quality=23, aspect_ratio="16:9"),
    audio_config=AudioConfig(mute=False),
)
```

### Reframe aspect ratio (for social platforms)

**Warning:** `reframe()` is a slow server-side operation. For long videos it can take
several minutes and may time out. Best practices:
- Always limit to a short segment using `start`/`end` when possible
- For full-length videos, use `callback_url` for async processing
- Trim the video on a `Timeline` first, then reframe the shorter result

```python
from videodb import ReframeMode

# Always prefer reframing a short segment:
reframed = video.reframe(start=0, end=60, target="vertical", mode=ReframeMode.smart)

# Async reframe for full-length videos (returns None, result via webhook):
video.reframe(target="vertical", callback_url="https://example.com/webhook")

# Presets: "vertical" (9:16), "square" (1:1), "landscape" (16:9)
reframed = video.reframe(start=0, end=60, target="square")

# Custom dimensions
reframed = video.reframe(start=0, end=60, target={"width": 1280, "height": 720})
```

### Generative media

```python
image = coll.generate_image(
    prompt="a sunset over mountains",
    aspect_ratio="16:9",
)
```

#### Imported: 2) Video ingest + stream

- Ingest a **file or URL** and return a **playable web stream link**
- Transcode/normalize: **codec, bitrate, fps, resolution, aspect ratio**

#### Imported: 4) Timeline editing + generation

- Subtitles: **generate**, **translate**, **burn-in**
- Overlays: **text/image/branding**, motion captions
- Audio: **background music**, **voiceover**, **dubbing**
- Programmatic composition and exports via **timeline operations**

#### Imported: 5) Live streams (RTSP) + monitoring

- Connect **RTSP/live feeds**
- Run **real-time visual and spoken understanding** and emit **events/alerts** for monitoring workflows

---

#### Imported: Common inputs

- Local **file path**, public **URL**, or **RTSP URL**
- Desktop capture request: **start / stop / summarize session**
- Desired operations: get context for understanding, transcode spec, index spec, search query, clip ranges, timeline edits, alert rules

#### Imported: Common outputs

- **Stream URL**
- Search results with **timestamps** and **evidence links**
- Generated assets: subtitles, audio, images, clips
- **Event/alert payloads** for live streams
- Desktop **session summaries** and memory entries

---

#### Imported: Running Python code

Before running any VideoDB code, change to the project directory and load environment variables:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv(".env")

import videodb
conn = videodb.connect()
```

This reads `VIDEO_DB_API_KEY` from:
1. Environment (if already exported)
2. Project's `.env` file in current directory

If the key is missing, `videodb.connect()` raises `AuthenticationError` automatically.

Do NOT write a script file when a short inline command works.

When writing inline Python (`python -c "..."`), always use properly formatted code — use semicolons to separate statements and keep it readable. For anything longer than ~3 statements, use a heredoc instead:

```bash
python << 'EOF'
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv(".env")

import videodb
conn = videodb.connect()
coll = conn.get_collection()
print(f"Videos: {len(coll.get_videos())}")
EOF
```

#### Imported: Error handling

```python
from videodb.exceptions import AuthenticationError, InvalidRequestError

try:
    conn = videodb.connect()
except AuthenticationError:
    print("Check your VIDEO_DB_API_KEY")

try:
    video = coll.upload(url="https://example.com/video.mp4")
except InvalidRequestError as e:
    print(f"Upload failed: {e}")
```

### Common pitfalls

| Scenario | Error message | Solution |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Indexing an already-indexed video | `Spoken word index for video already exists` | Use `video.index_spoken_words(force=True)` to skip if already indexed |
| Scene index already exists | `Scene index with id XXXX already exists` | Extract the existing `scene_index_id` from the error with `re.search(r"id\s+([a-f0-9]+)", str(e))` |
| Search finds no matches | `InvalidRequestError: No results found` | Catch the exception and treat as empty results (`shots = []`) |
| Reframe times out | Blocks indefinitely on long videos | Use `start`/`end` to limit segment, or pass `callback_url` for async |
| Negative timestamps on Timeline | Silently produces broken stream | Always validate `start >= 0` before creating `VideoAsset` |
| `generate_video()` / `create_collection()` fails | `Operation not allowed` or `maximum limit` | Plan-gated features — inform the user about plan limits |

#### Imported: Screen Recording (Desktop Capture)

Use `ws_listener.py` to capture WebSocket events during recording sessions. Desktop capture supports **macOS** only.

### Quick Start

1. **Start listener**: `python scripts/ws_listener.py &`
2. **Get WebSocket ID**: `cat /tmp/videodb_ws_id`
3. **Run capture code** (see reference/capture.md for full workflow)
4. **Events written to**: `/tmp/videodb_events.jsonl`

### Query Events

```python
import json
events = [json.loads(l) for l in open("/tmp/videodb_events.jsonl")]

# Get all transcripts
transcripts = [e["data"]["text"] for e in events if e.get("channel") == "transcript"]

# Get visual descriptions from last 5 minutes
import time
cutoff = time.time() - 300
recent_visual = [e for e in events
                 if e.get("channel") == "visual_index" and e["unix_ts"] > cutoff]
```

### Utility Scripts

- [scripts/ws_listener.py](scripts/ws_listener.py) - WebSocket event listener (dumps to JSONL)

For complete capture workflow, see [reference/capture.md](reference/capture.md).

**Do not use ffmpeg, moviepy, or local encoding tools** when VideoDB supports the operation. The following are all handled server-side by VideoDB — trimming, combining clips, overlaying audio or music, adding subtitles, text/image overlays, transcoding, resolution changes, aspect-ratio conversion, resizing for platform requirements, transcription, and media generation. Only fall back to local tools for operations listed under Limitations in reference/editor.md (transitions, speed changes, crop/zoom, colour grading, volume mixing).

### When to use what

| Problem | VideoDB solution |
|---------|-----------------|
| Platform rejects video aspect ratio or resolution | `video.reframe()` or `conn.transcode()` with `VideoConfig` |
| Need to resize video for Twitter/Instagram/TikTok | `video.reframe(target="vertical")` or `target="square"` |
| Need to change resolution (e.g. 1080p → 720p) | `conn.transcode()` with `VideoConfig(resolution=720)` |
| Need to overlay audio/music on video | `AudioAsset` on a `Timeline` |
| Need to add subtitles | `video.add_subtitle()` or `CaptionAsset` |
| Need to combine/trim clips | `VideoAsset` on a `Timeline` |
| Need to generate voiceover, music, or SFX | `coll.generate_voice()`, `generate_music()`, `generate_sound_effect()` |
