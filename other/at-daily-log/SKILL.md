# Daily Work Log

`resolve evidence -> group related commits -> draft or record`

## Date and evidence scope

Default to today. Accept plain-language dates or ranges (`2026-07-31`, yesterday, last
week, this month) and normalize to `[from, to]`; query through `<to + 1 day>` because
Git's `--until` boundary is exclusive. State the resolved date or range.

Read optional `workProjects` from `~/.agent-tools/config.jsonc`. An entry is a path
or `{ "path", "prompt" }`, where the prompt is free text this skill follows for that
project, such as how to label items or which commits to skip.

- No project named: current Git repository plus configured projects.
- Projects named directly: only those projects.
- "Also include" / `另外包含`: add them to the default scope.

Resolve paths to Git roots and deduplicate them. Report invalid paths; a non-Git current
directory does not block other valid projects. Do not clone remote URLs without consent.

For each repository, resolve the author with `git -C <root> config user.name`; never
infer aliases or use the remote login as the author.

Inspect all local branches, current HEAD, user-named branches, and configured
upstreams. Unless the user requests local-only data, refresh only the configured
upstream branches, grouped into one best-effort `git fetch --no-tags <remote>
<branch...>` per involved remote. Fetch failure is non-fatal. Do not change the
working tree or local branch history.

Then list candidates with `git -C <root> log --no-merges --since=<from>
--until=<to+1day> --format=%H%x09%an --branches HEAD <upstream refs>`, taking the
upstream refs from `git -C <root> for-each-ref --format=%(upstream) refs/heads/`.
Passing no ref walks only the current branch, so work on an unmerged branch reads as
no activity; `--all` reaches past the scope above into remote branches nobody tracks.
Keep the rows whose `%an` equals the resolved name exactly. Never pass `--author`: it
matches the whole `Name <email>` header, so anchored patterns silently match nothing.
When the window holds commits but none carry that name, report the names actually
found instead. Deduplicate commits by hash.

## Build work items

Collect non-merge commits for the resolved author and day. Use subjects and changed
paths to turn related commits into concrete completed work items. Fold formatting,
version bumps, and follow-up fixes into the outcome they supported; do not inflate one
change into several deliverables. Never restate a
commit subject as the work item; describe the outcome it produced. A day left with
nothing has no reportable activity.

Use file counts and added/deleted lines only when they meaningfully support the work
item. Generated files, lockfile churn, renames, and bulk formatting often make those
numbers misleading. Metrics are evidence, never hours, difficulty, impact, or a
productivity score.

Uncommitted changes are not work items. At most, note them factually in a chat draft
for today (project and files, no invented progress); never write them to the file:
their dates are unverifiable, and a project left dirty for weeks would reappear as in
progress every day. User-provided non-code work must remain clearly identified as user
context.

`~/.agent-tools/config.jsonc` may also carry `log.output`, an automatically recorded
AI session log, separate from `dailyLog.output`. It is a markdown file with dated
entries, or a directory holding one `<date>.md` report per day; entries under
`log.projects` may route their sessions to their own `output`, so check those paths
too. When `log.format` is `daily`, read its single-line results only as activity
leads: they may be truncated and omit important context. Do not state a log-only
item as a confirmed outcome from a daily entry alone. When `log.format` is `detailed`, its
per-day reports are stronger supplementary evidence, but still do not replace Git
or user confirmation. If the `log` block or its output is absent, skip this entirely.
Merge, do not duplicate, work already backed by commits.

## Output

Match the user's language:

```markdown
+ 2026-07-31
  1. agent-tools: 完成多项目日报规则和 skill 落地.
  2. vscode-plugin: 修复 Webview 刷新后状态丢失问题, 补充回归验证.
```

Start each item with the label that best locates the work for a reader: the project
name when the day spans projects, a module or feature within a single one.

Keep entries compact: the file accumulates for months, so every recurring line must
earn its place. Do not add per-day summary, total, or section-header lines; the
numbered items already show project and count.

Prefer outcomes over raw Git metrics. If no verified activity exists, say so rather
than fabricate an entry. For a range, output one entry per day with activity, oldest
first, and skip empty days.

## Draft or record

"Generate" / `生成日报` returns a draft. "Record" / `记录日报`, or an explicit
write request, writes after previewing the entry. A draft may close with one short
line offering to record it; treat any affirmative reply to that offer as the go-ahead,
and keep the suggested word short (`记录` / `record`). Resolve the destination in order:

1. a path supplied in conversation;
2. optional `dailyLog.output` in `~/.agent-tools/config.jsonc`;
3. no destination: return the draft without writing.

Read the destination before editing. Wrap each date's generated content in that date's
own markers, `<!-- daily-log:2026-07-31:start 5,a1b2c3d -->` / `<!-- daily-log:2026-07-31:end -->`,
where the start marker stores the day's commit count and newest commit hash across the
scanned projects; the date line and every line outside the markers belong to the user.
Refresh an existing block when either value changed or the user explicitly asks;
otherwise leave it alone, because regenerated wording varies between runs. For an existing date, show
the current block and the regenerated one before writing, then replace only that
date's block. If the date exists without markers, append a marked block below the
user's lines instead of editing them. Do not duplicate the date. Insert a new date
among the existing dated entries at its date-order position, inferring ascending or
descending from the dates already present (ascending when that is ambiguous). A date
that sorts last goes right after the final dated entry, not at the end of the file:
notes, comment blocks and todo lists kept below the log stay below it. On duplicate or
unpaired markers, stop and propose the edit instead of writing. When neither Git nor
the session log shows activity for the day, leave the file unchanged and say so; the
user can add a manual entry themselves. Recording a range applies these rules to each day's block independently.

Scheduling is separate; set it up only when the user asks. Prefer the OS scheduler
(Task Scheduler, cron, launchd) over agent-internal timers, which stop with the agent:
schedule a headless run of the CLI this skill is executing in — `claude -p <prompt>`,
`codex exec <prompt>`, `opencode run <prompt>` — invoking the skill with the recording
request the user asked for, as in `claude -p "/at-daily-log record the log"`. How a
skill is addressed varies per CLI, so the test run below is what confirms it.
Keep projects and output in config so the command stays stable. Before registering,
confirm the schedule, make sure the output file is resolvable, and run the exact
command once; register only after that test run records correctly, and show how to
remove the task. Headless auth
differs from the interactive session, so a failed test run means stop instead of
registering, and show the exact command, its error output, and the likely fix (log in
for headless use, adjust the output path). An unattended run has nobody to confirm
with, so it must follow the marker rules exactly and skip any file it cannot edit that
way: it fills missing days and refreshes days whose stored count or hash moved,
nothing else.
