# mcp-tool-docs-stinger

Procedural arsenal for `mcp-tool-docs-wasp-drone`, the Wasp Nest's tool/API/CLI documentation specialist. This stinger encodes how to document any tool, API, and CLI surface honestly: schema-selected tools (MCP tools first and foremost - name, purpose, input schema, output shape, side effects, annotations, examples), the TypeScript public API rendered with a generator (TypeDoc, and API Extractor where a reviewable public-API contract is needed), a CLI's command surface, doc-to-code sync discipline, and changelog discipline tied to a released artifact's real version.

Hivemind (`@deeplake/hivemind`) - the MCP tools exposed by `src/mcp/server.ts` plus the OpenClaw goal/KPI contracts, its TypeScript public API, the `hivemind` CLI, and its `sync-versions`-driven changelog - remains fully covered throughout as a worked example. The guides teach the general practice first and point to the Wasp Nestmind case for a real, end-to-end illustration.

## When this stinger applies

Load this stinger when `mcp-tool-docs-wasp-drone` is invoked. Typical triggers:

- "Document these MCP tools."
- "Is the description on this tool honest? Does it match the code?"
- "Write the input schema and output shape for this tool."
- "Generate the TypeScript API reference."
- "Document this CLI's command surface."
- "These docs drifted from the code - re-sync them."
- "Write a changelog entry for this release."
- "Audit the tool/API/CLI docs."
- "Document the Wasp Nestmind MCP tools / the hivemind CLI / Hivemind's TypeDoc setup." (the worked-example case)

Do NOT load it for:

- MCP protocol, transport, or handshake internals (route to `mcp-protocol-wasp-drone`).
- Prose-quality review or ghostwriting - Diataxis mode, inverted-pyramid structure, voice/tone, "is this well-written" (route to `technical-writing-craft-wasp-drone`). This Drone transcribes facts from source honestly; it does not review prose craft.
- OpenAPI/REST API documentation - Swagger UI / Redoc / Scalar / Mintlify renderer selection, OpenAPI spec example enrichment, REST SDK generation from an OpenAPI spec (route to `api-docs-wasp-drone`).
- Docs-site platform and hosting - Docusaurus / Starlight / Mintlify / GitBook selection, docs-as-code CI for a whole site, search setup (route to `docs-site-wasp-drone`).
- README authoring as a standalone deliverable (route to `readme-writing-wasp-drone`).
- The `library/` knowledge convention or general knowledge capture docs (route to `library-wasp-drone` / `knowledge-wasp-drone`).
- Deeplake dataset schema design (route to `vector-store-wasp-drone`).

## First action when this stinger is loaded

Read these in order before doing anything else:

1. **`guides/00-principles.md`** - doc honesty, the five quality gates, when to route elsewhere, and the core invariants (general, not product-specific).
2. **`guides/01-mcp-tool-docs.md`** - how to document any schema-selected tool from its real registration and handler. Read this before documenting any tool.
3. **`research/distilled-mcp-tool-docs.md`** - the current synthesis: honest MCP tool docs (including annotations), TypeScript API reference generation beyond TypeDoc, CLI documentation conventions, doc-to-code sync tooling, and changelog automation.

Then walk the remaining guides in task order. Each guide teaches the general practice first, then points to the matching `examples/*.md` file for a worked Hivemind case. Always read the real source before writing - these docs are honest about the code or they are wrong.

## Surfaces to document

| Surface | Source of truth | How it's documented |
|---|---|---|
| **Schema-selected tools (MCP, etc.)** | the server's tool-registration code | Name, purpose, input schema, output shape, side effects, annotations (where the protocol defines them), examples |
| **TypeScript public API** | exported types + functions in source | TypeDoc (readable reference), API Extractor (reviewable public-API contract) - pick one or both per `guides/02-typedoc.md` |
| **CLI** | the CLI's dispatch/routing + its own usage/help text | Command reference: usage, flags, side effects, non-interactive path, disambiguation notes |
| **In-repo reference docs** | README, architecture/feature docs | Kept in sync with code; doc honesty enforced |
| **Changelog** | the artifact's single-sourced released version | Entry per released version, hand-written impact-first or generated from Conventional Commits |

**Worked example (Hivemind):** the MCP tools shipped today are `hivemind_search`, `hivemind_read`, and `hivemind_index` (stdio transport, read-only, auth via `~/.deeplake/credentials.json`); OpenClaw additionally contracts `hivemind_goal_add` and `hivemind_kpi_add` (write tools). The TS public API is rendered with TypeDoc from `src/index.ts`. The CLI (`hivemind install [--only <platforms>] [--skip-auth] [--token <value>]`, `hivemind <agent> install`, `hivemind uninstall`, `hivemind login`, `hivemind status`, `hivemind update [--dry-run]`, plus `goal`/`kpi`/`context`/`graph`/`dashboard`/`rules`/`skillify`/`embeddings <sub>`) is documented from `src/cli/index.ts` routing - never from memory. The changelog tracks `@deeplake/hivemind`, single-sourced via `scripts/sync-versions.mjs`. See `guides/01-mcp-tool-docs.md` through `guides/05-changelog.md` for the general procedure each of these demonstrates, and `examples/*.md` for the worked docs themselves.

## Cross-links (adjacent Drones - route there instead of duplicating)

This stinger owns the **source-derived reference-docs layer** for tool, API, and CLI surfaces. Three adjacent stingers own territory this one does not - cross-link rather than re-teaching their material:

- **`technical-writing-craft-stinger`** - the craft of writing well: Diataxis mode classification, inverted-pyramid structure, code-example discipline, voice/tone, ghostwriting, docs-as-code prose review. Use it when the question is "is this well-written," not "does this doc match the code."
- **`api-docs-stinger`** - OpenAPI/REST API documentation specifically: Swagger UI / Redoc / Scalar / Mintlify / Stoplight / Bump.sh tool selection, OpenAPI spec example enrichment, REST SDK generation (openapi-generator-cli, Fern, Speakeasy). Use it for a REST API's OpenAPI spec and its renderer; use this skill for the TypeScript SDK's exported symbols and any MCP/CLI surface.
- **`docs-site-stinger`** - documentation-site platform selection and hosting (Docusaurus, Starlight, Mintlify, GitBook, MkDocs Material, Nextra, Fern), docs-as-code CI for a whole site, search setup. This skill's generated API reference is often published *inside* one of those sites - picking and running the site itself belongs there.

## Critical directives (lifted from the Command Brief)

These are non-negotiables. Full justification in `guides/00-principles.md`.

- **Read the source before writing a single line.** A tool doc that does not match `src/mcp/server.ts` is a bug, not documentation.
- **Tool descriptions and schemas must match real behavior.** The zod `inputSchema`, the output `content` shape, and the side effects are facts, not prose. Honest or wrong, no middle.
- **Every MCP tool doc carries six parts:** name, purpose, input schema (from zod), output shape, side effects, and at least one example.
- **TypeDoc renders from the TS types, not hand-written prose.** Fix the doc comment in the source; never fork the truth into a separate file.
- **The changelog is tied to the npm version.** `scripts/sync-versions.mjs` single-sources the version; the changelog tracks `@deeplake/hivemind` releases, not arbitrary dates.
- **Do not scope-creep into protocol internals or README authoring.** Route to `mcp-protocol-wasp-drone` / `readme-writing-wasp-drone`.
- **This is a general documentation practice, not a single-product skill.** The Wasp Nestmind-specific facts above still hold exactly as written for Hivemind; when documenting any other project's tools, API, or CLI, apply the same shape (six-part tool docs, generated API references, source-derived CLI references, single-sourced changelog versions) to that project's real source instead.
- **Set and check MCP tool annotations, not just prose side effects.** Where a server defines `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint` / `openWorldHint`, the tool doc records the real values and flags any contradiction with the prose side-effect claim; where none are set, say so and note the pessimistic default a client will assume.
- **Do not scope-creep into OpenAPI/REST docs, docs-site platform work, or prose-craft review.** Route to `api-docs-wasp-drone`, `docs-site-wasp-drone`, or `technical-writing-craft-wasp-drone` respectively - see Cross-links above.
