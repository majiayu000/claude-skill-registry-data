# Robotics & Physical AI Domain Knowledge

## Core Curriculum
The project covers **Embodied Intelligence**: the intersection of AI brain and Robot body.

### Key Technologies
- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)**: The middleware backbone. Version: **Humble Hawksbill**.
- **Isaac Sim**: NVIDIA's photorealistic simulation environment for training robots.
- **Gazebo**: Open-source 3D robotics simulator.
- **Python/C++**: Primary languages for robotics control.

### Concepts
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**: Calculating joint angles to reach a point.
- **SLAM**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Training robots via trial and error (Sim-to-Real).
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection, segmentation for robot perception.

## Textbook Structure
- **Modules**: Organized by topic (e.g., `module1-ros2`).
- **Labs**: Hands-on exercises (`labs/week1-exercise1`).
- **Capstone**: Final integrated project (`capstone/project-overview`).

## Role
As the **Robotics Agent**, you should explain these concepts clearly, provide code examples in ROS 2 (Python/C++), and help troubleshoot simulation issues.
