# JSON Structures, Import Mappings & Export Mappings

This skill covers creating and managing JSON structures, import mappings, and export mappings in Mendix using MDL.

## Key Concepts

### JSON Structures
A JSON structure defines the schema of a JSON payload. It stores a JSON snippet and auto-derives an element tree with paths, types, and custom names.

### Import Mappings
An import mapping converts a JSON string into Mendix entity objects. It maps JSON fields to entity attributes.

#### Two names per member: the raw key and the exposed name

Every JSON structure element stores **both**, and for any lowercase-initial key
they differ:

| | Example | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| **Path** (raw JSON key) | `(Object)\|uuid` | what the **runtime** resolves by |
| **ExposedName** (derived) | `Uuid` | what **Studio Pro displays** |

Mendix derives the exposed name by capitalising the initial, and for an array's
item object by suffixing `Item` — so `total` → `Total`, `camelCase` → `CamelCase`,
`__Value` (array) → `__ValueItem` (its item). Keys already starting with an
underscore are left alone: `__returnedCount` stays `__returnedCount`.

This is **Mendix's own convention, not something mxcli does**. A blank app's
Studio-Pro-authored `FeedbackModule.JSON_AppInsightsResponse` stores
`ExposedName: "Uuid"` against `Path: "(Object)|uuid"`, and its `IMM_PostResponse`
binds `JsonPath: "(Object)|uuid"`.

Consequences worth knowing:

- **Either spelling works in MDL.** `Total = total` and `Total = Total` produce the
  same stored mapping. Write whichever you have.
- **`DESCRIBE` emits the raw JSON key**, so its output reproduces the script that
  produced the mapping — `Total = total` comes back as `Total = total`, and an
  array binding as `= item` rather than `= ItemItem`. It also emits
  `create or modify`, so the output re-runs against the project it was read from.
  (Until #915 it printed the exposed name and a bare `create`: the text differed
  from the input, making every script-vs-describe diff noise, and re-running it
  failed with "import mapping already exists". The stored mapping was correct
  either way.)
- **A member matching neither spelling is refused**, listing what would have
  worked. It is never written with a guessed path: such a mapping passed
  `mxcli check` and failed later in mxbuild (CE5015) or at runtime.

#### Inherited attributes

Mendix inheritance is multi-table: all of a parent's attributes are members of the
child, so an entity created with `extends` can map them. Name an inherited
attribute exactly like one of the entity's own — mxcli resolves each to the entity
that **declares** it, which is the reference Studio Pro needs to show the field
mapped.

```sql
mdl 1;
create persistent entity Docs.DocumentBase (
  DocName: String(200),
  Confidential: Boolean
);

create persistent entity Docs.Contract extends Docs.DocumentBase (
  ContractNumber: String(50)
);

create import mapping Docs.IMM_Contract
  with json structure Docs.JSON_Contract
{
  create Docs.Contract {
    ContractNumber = contractNumber,   -- own
    DocName        = docName,          -- inherited
    Confidential   = confidential      -- inherited
  }
};
```

Qualifying an inherited attribute against the entity being mapped instead of its
declaring entity is Mendix **CE1613** "The selected attribute ... no longer
exists", and the field shows unmapped in Studio Pro.

## Export Mappings
An export mapping converts Mendix entity objects into a JSON string. It maps entity attributes to JSON fields.

### Critical: Import and Export Need Different Domain Models

**Import and export mappings for the same JSON structure typically require different entity structures.**

- **Import**: The child entity owns the FK to the parent (`from Child to Parent`). Arrays map directly to the item entity — no intermediate container entity needed.
- **Export**: The domain model mirrors the JSON structure. Arrays need an intermediate container entity (e.g., `Items`) plus an item entity (e.g., `ItemsItem`). The container links to the parent, the item links to the container.

---

## JSON Structures

### Create

```sql
mdl 1;
create json structure Module.JSON_Pet
  sample '{"id": 1, "name": "Fido", "status": "available"}';
```

For multi-line JSON, use dollar-quoting:
```sql
mdl 1;
create json structure Module.JSON_Order
  sample $${
  "orderId": 100,
  "customer": {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"},
  "items": [{"sku": "A1", "quantity": 2, "price": 9.99}]
}$$;
```

Custom name mapping (rename JSON fields):
```sql
mdl 1;
create json structure Module.JSON_Pet
  sample '{"id": 1, "name": "Fido"}'
  CUSTOM NAME map ('id' as '_id');
```

**Name array items yourself** — `item of` (ako/mxcli#272). An array's item is the
anonymous `[...]` entry, so it has no JSON key and the plain form cannot reach
it; left alone it gets a derived name like `LinesItem`:

```sql
mdl 1;
create json structure Module.JSON_Invoice
  sample '{"lines": [{"sku": "A1"}], "tags": ["urgent"]}'
  CUSTOM NAME map (
    'lines' as 'OrderLines',
    item of 'lines' as 'OrderLine',
    item of 'tags' as 'Tag'
  );
```

This is worth doing rather than accepting the default: a **mapping element clones
the schema element's ExposedName**, so the item's name is what every mapping over
this structure carries, and it is one of the two names a member resolves by.

- The two clauses are independent — naming an item does not require renaming its
  array, so adding one is a one-line diff.
- `item of` names a primitive array's **wrapper** too; that wrapper *is* the item.
- A root-level array has no key: `item of 'Root' as 'Entry'`.
- An entry whose key is not in the snippet is an error (`MDL-JSON01`), as is
  `item of` on something that is not an array (`MDL-JSON02`).

### Browse

```sql
mdl 1;
list json structures;
list json structures in module;
describe json structure Module.JSON_Pet;
drop json structure Module.JSON_Pet;
```

## Message Definitions

A mapping's source can also be a **message definition** — 74 of the 327 mappings
in the demo corpus (22.6%), and the only non-JSON source MDL can create. It
holds nothing external: it is a **selection over the domain model**.

```sql
mdl 1;
create message definition collection Sales.MD_Order {
  definition OrderMessage for Sales.Order as 'Orders' {
    OrderId,
    Sales.Order_Customer/Sales.Customer { FirstName }
  }
};
```

A bare name is an attribute; `Assoc/Module.Entity` is an association. **Name the
target entity** — the stored cardinality follows the direction of traversal and
the association's type, so a `Reference` gives a single object one way and a list
the other, while a `ReferenceSet` is a list both ways.

The full vocabulary, the ALTER statements, inherited attributes and what mxcli
deliberately does not guess:
[reference/message-definitions.md](reference/message-definitions.md).


## Import Mappings

### Domain Model for Import

For import mappings, associations point FROM the child entity TO the parent:

```sql
mdl 1;
create non-persistent entity Module.OrderResponse (
  OrderId: integer
);

create non-persistent entity Module.CustomerInfo (
  Name: string,
  Email: string
);

create non-persistent entity Module.OrderItem (
  Sku: string,
  Quantity: integer,
  Price: decimal
);

-- Child entity owns the FK (FROM child TO parent)
create association Module.CustomerInfo_OrderResponse
  from Module.CustomerInfo
  to Module.OrderResponse;

create association Module.OrderItem_OrderResponse
  from Module.OrderItem
  to Module.OrderResponse;
```

### Simple Import Mapping (flat JSON)

```sql
mdl 1;
create import mapping Module.IMM_Pet
  with json structure Module.JSON_Pet
{
  create Module.PetResponse {
    PetId = id,
    Name = name,
    status = status
  }
};
```

### Nested Import Mapping (objects and arrays)

Arrays map directly to the item entity — no intermediate container needed:

```sql
mdl 1;
create import mapping Module.IMM_Order
  with json structure Module.JSON_Order
{
  create Module.OrderResponse {
    OrderId = orderId,
    create Module.CustomerInfo_OrderResponse/Module.CustomerInfo = customer {
      Name = name,
      Email = email
    },
    create Module.OrderItem_OrderResponse/Module.OrderItem = items {
      Sku = sku,
      Quantity = quantity,
      Price = price
    }
  }
};
```

### Object Handling

Mendix stores **two** properties here, not one: how to get the object, and what
to do when a `find` comes up empty. Both are yours to choose.

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `create Module.Entity` | Always create a new object (default) |
| `find Module.Entity or create` | Find by KEY, create one if not found |
| `find Module.Entity or error` | Find by KEY, fail the import if not found |
| `find Module.Entity or ignore` | Find by KEY, skip the element if not found |
| `find or create Module.Entity` | The older spelling of `find … or create` |

Append `overridable` to let the caller override the backup at import time:
`find Module.PetResponse or create overridable`.

```sql
mdl 1;
create import mapping Module.IMM_UpsertPet
  with json structure Module.JSON_Pet
{
  find Module.PetResponse or create {
    PetId = id key,
    Name = name,
    status = status
  }
};
```

**A bare `find` is refused.** Which of the three you get is a real runtime
difference, and mxcli used to pick `create` for you whatever the document said —
so it now asks rather than guessing.

**A `find` has two requirements, and mxcli check enforces both** (ako/mxcli#253):

1. **At least one member marked `key`**, per searching element — nested ones
   included. Without it there is nothing to search on: **CE0250**, reported as
   `MDL-MAP02`. (`key` is only valid with `find`; on a `create` it means nothing.)
2. **A persistable entity.** A search is a database query, and a non-persistent
   entity has no database: **CE0251**, reported as `MDL-MAP03`. Persistability
   comes from the **generalization chain**, not the entity's own flag — an entity
   declared with plain `create entity` that extends a non-persistent parent is
   still not searchable.

Re-measuring these is easy to get wrong: mxbuild reports **one at a time**. A
keyless `find` over a non-persistent entity is CE0250 only, and CE0251 appears
only once a key exists.

A **custom handler is exempt from both** — the microflow *is* the find, so there
is no key to declare and no query to run.

### Custom Object Handling and the Mapping's Input Object

A microflow can resolve the object instead of Create/Find. Write it as `by` on
the element; the microflow's parameters are named with their sources:

| Source | Means |
|--------|-------|
| `parent` | the enclosing mapped object |
| `parameter` | the mapping's own input object |
| `parent(2)` | an ancestor N levels up |
| `a/b/c` | a value from the payload, addressed like any other member |

`parameter` needs the mapping to declare an input object, which is a clause on
the header — import mappings only:

```sql
mdl 1;
create import mapping Module.IMM_Embed
  with json structure Module.JSON_Embed
  parameter GenAICommons.ChunkCollection
{
  create GenAICommons.ChunkCollection {
    Name = id,
    find Module.Chunk_ChunkCollection/GenAICommons.Chunk
      by Module.MF_FindChunk ( Collection: parameter, Index: idx )
      = embeddings {
        Text = text
      }
  }
};
```

Using `parameter` without declaring one is refused — the build reports it as
CE0279. The declared entity must match the microflow's parameter type, which the
build checks as CE0282.

## Export Mappings

### Domain Model for Export

Export mappings require entities that **mirror the JSON structure**. Arrays need an intermediate container entity:

```sql
mdl 1;
-- Root entity (matches top-level JSON object)
create non-persistent entity Module.ExRoot (
  OrderId: integer
);

-- Nested object entity (1-1 relationship, use OWNER Both)
create non-persistent entity Module.ExCustomer (
  Name: string,
  Email: string
);

-- Array CONTAINER entity (no attributes, just links parent to items)
create non-persistent entity Module.ExItems;

-- Array ITEM entity (attributes for each array element)
create non-persistent entity Module.ExItemsItem (
  Sku: string,
  Quantity: integer,
  Price: decimal
);

-- Associations: child FROM, parent TO
create association Module.ExCustomer_ExRoot
  from Module.ExCustomer
  to Module.ExRoot
  owner both;   -- 1-1 for nested objects

create association Module.ExItems_ExRoot
  from Module.ExItems
  to Module.ExRoot;   -- 1-* for arrays

create association Module.ExItemsItem_ExItems
  from Module.ExItemsItem
  to Module.ExItems;   -- 1-* for array items
```

### Simple Export Mapping (flat JSON)

```sql
mdl 1;
create export mapping Module.EMM_Pet
  with json structure Module.JSON_Pet
{
  Module.PetResponse {
    id = PetId,
    name = Name,
    status = status
  }
};
```

### Nested Export Mapping (objects and arrays)

Arrays have TWO levels: container entity + item entity:

```sql
mdl 1;
create export mapping Module.EMM_Order
  with json structure Module.JSON_Order
{
  Module.ExRoot {
    orderId = OrderId,
    Module.ExCustomer_ExRoot/Module.ExCustomer as customer {
      name = Name,
      email = Email
    },
    Module.ExItems_ExRoot/Module.ExItems as items {
      Module.ExItemsItem_ExItems/Module.ExItemsItem as ItemsItem {
        sku = Sku,
        quantity = Quantity,
        price = Price
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### NULL VALUES option

```sql
create export mapping Module.EMM_Pet
  with json structure Module.JSON_Pet
  null values SendAsNil     -- or LeaveOutElement (default)
{
  ...
};
```

---

## Starting a Mapping Below the Payload Root

A mapping does not have to start at the top of the JSON. `root a/b/c` on the
source clause selects the element it starts at, and the path may pass **through
arrays** — the mapping is then rooted at the array's item, so it yields one
object per entry.

```sql
mdl 1;
create import mapping RootDemo.IMM_Choices
  with json structure RootDemo.JSON_Completion root response/choices/message
{ create RootDemo.Message { Role = role, Content = content } };
```

Worked examples, the array-crossing rule and what it does to a call's
cardinality: [reference/mapping-root-selection.md](reference/mapping-root-selection.md).


## Microflow Actions

### Import from Mapping (JSON → entities)

```sql
-- With result variable (non-persistent entities)
$PetResponse = import from mapping Module.IMM_Pet($JsonContent);

-- Without result variable (persistent entities, stores to DB)
import from mapping Module.IMM_Pet($JsonContent);
```

#### Range — how much of the result to bind

Optional trailing clause, matching Studio Pro's **All / First / Custom** setting
on the activity. Omitting it means **All**; whether the variable is an object or
a list is inferred from the mapping's own root shape, as it always has.
`describe` leaves `all` off an object result (writing it there reads as "returns
a list") and prints it for a list result — the two spellings store the same
activity.

```sql
$Pets = import from mapping Module.IMM_Pets($Json) all;            -- All (the default)
$Pet  = import from mapping Module.IMM_Pets($Json) first;          -- First: ONE object
$Page = import from mapping Module.IMM_Pets($Json) limit 10;       -- Custom
$Page = import from mapping Module.IMM_Pets($Json) limit 10 offset 5;
```

`first` is a separate word from `limit 1` on purpose: `limit 1` is a *list* of
one, `first` binds a single *object*, so the result variable's type differs.

Two things the range does **not** do:

- **It does not change what the mapping returns.** An object-rooted mapping
  binds an object under every range — `all` on one is Studio Pro's own default,
  and the blank app ships one (`FeedbackModule.SUB_Feedback_PostToAppInsights`).
  Only `first` narrows a list mapping to a single object.
- **`offset` is not accepted everywhere.** Mendix rejects it with
  **CE6100** ("This entity does not support offset") unless the mapping's root
  is a list; `limit` alone is fine either way. Verified on mxbuild 11.6.6.
- **`first` is not for an object-rooted mapping.** It narrows a list; on a
  mapping that already returns one object it builds clean (`mx check`: 0
  errors) and the activity **throws at runtime**. `mxcli check` refuses it,
  and `offset` on such a mapping, as **MDL-MAP04** — drop the range.

### Export to Mapping (entity → JSON)

```sql
$JsonOutput = export to mapping Module.EMM_Pet($PetResponse);
```

### Complete Pipeline

```sql
mdl 1;
create microflow Module.ProcessData ()
begin
  declare $json string = $latestHttpResponse/content;
  $PetResponse = import from mapping Module.IMM_Pet($json);
  -- Process...
  $Output = export to mapping Module.EMM_Pet($PetResponse);
  log info node 'Integration' 'Result: ' + $Output;
end;
```

---

## Browse

```sql
list import mappings [in module];
list export mappings [in module];
describe import mapping Module.Name;
describe export mapping Module.Name;
drop import mapping Module.Name;
drop export mapping Module.Name;
```

---

## Export Workflow: PE → NPE → JSON

Export mappings work on non-persistent entity (NPE) structures that mirror the target JSON. When the source data is in persistent entities (PE) in the database, the typical workflow is:

1. **Retrieve** persistent data from the database
2. **Build NPE tree** in a microflow: create NPE objects, set attributes, link via associations to match the JSON structure
3. **Export to mapping** to serialize the NPE tree to JSON

```sql
mdl 1;
-- Example: build NPE tree from persistent Order data, then export
create microflow Module.ExportOrder ($Order: Module.Order)
returns string as $json
begin
  -- Build the NPE tree matching the JSON structure
  $Root = create Module.ExRoot (OrderId = $Order/OrderId);

  retrieve $Customer from $Order/Module.Order_Customer;
  $ExCust = create Module.ExCustomer (Name = $Customer/Name, Email = $Customer/Email);
  -- Link customer to root...

  -- Export
  $json = export to mapping Module.EMM_Order($Root);
  return $json;
end;
```

### Shortcut with View Entities

View Entities (OQL-backed) can retrieve data directly into the export-ready structure, skipping the manual NPE assembly:

```sql
mdl 1;
create view entity Module.ExOrderView (
  OrderId: integer,
  CustomerName: string,
  CustomerEmail: string
) as (
  select o.OrderId as OrderId, c.Name as CustomerName, c.Email as CustomerEmail
  from Module.Order as o
  join o/Module.Order_Customer/Module.Customer as c
);
```

This can reduce the microflow to a single retrieve + export step.

---

## Realistic Example: Countries REST API

One worked example — structures, import of a single object and of a list, export
in both directions, and the microflow that ties them together — is in
[`reference/rest-api-example.md`](reference/rest-api-example.md).


## Placing Documents in Folders

Every one of these documents takes a `folder` clause on `create`, straight after
the qualified name. Missing folders in the path are created:

```mdl
mdl 1;
create json structure Sales.JSON_Order folder 'Private/JSON structures'
  sample '{"id": 1, "total": 9.99}';

create import mapping Sales.IMM_Order folder 'Private/Import mappings'
  with json structure Sales.JSON_Order
{
  create Sales.Order { OrderId = id, Total = total }
};
```

On `create or modify` the clause **moves** an existing document. Omitting it
leaves placement alone — it never returns a document to the module root — so
adding a folder to an existing script is safe and removing one is a no-op.
`describe` emits the clause, so a description replays into the same folder.

See `organize-project` for `move` and the full folder story.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Reusing import domain model for export | Export needs separate entities mirroring JSON structure |
| Association direction wrong | Always FROM child TO parent (child owns FK) |
| Using `owner default` for 1-1 nested objects in export | Use `owner both` for 1-1 relationships |
| Missing array container entity in export | Arrays need Container + Item entities |
| Using `key` with `create` handling | `key` only valid with `find` |
| `find` without `or create` / `or error` / `or ignore` | Say what happens when the object is not found — the three differ at runtime |
| `find` with no member marked `key` (MDL-MAP02) | Mark the identifying member — a search needs something to search on (CE0250) |
| `find` over a non-persistent entity (MDL-MAP03) | Use `create`, or make the entity persistent — a search is a database query (CE0251) |
| `Param: parameter` with no `parameter Module.Entity` on the header | Declare the mapping's input object, or the build reports CE0279 |
| `parameter` on an EXPORT mapping | Export mappings have no input object — their parameter is the root object |
| Arrays in import with container entity | Import arrays map directly to item entity, no container |
