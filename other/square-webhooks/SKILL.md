# Square Webhooks

## When to Use This Skill

- How do I receive Square webhooks?
- How do I verify Square webhook signatures?
- How do I handle `payment.updated` or `refund.created` events?
- Why is my Square webhook signature verification failing?
- Setting up Square webhook handlers for payments, refunds, invoices, or orders

## Verification (core)

Square signs each webhook with an **HMAC-SHA256** over the **notification URL
concatenated with the raw request body** (`notificationUrl + rawBody`, in that
order — confirmed by testing), base64-encoded, delivered in the
`x-square-hmacsha256-signature` header. The notification URL is part of the
signed content, so it must exactly match — byte-for-byte — the URL configured in
your Square subscription. Always verify the **raw** body — never `JSON.parse`
first.

> **Top pitfall:** the HMAC key is the subscription's **Signature Key** (short,
> e.g. `qfjakbt2uWB8DKAMECF-EA`), used verbatim — **not** an OAuth access token
> (`EAAA…`), which produces no match. Square's docs document only the
> **SHA-256** header; verify that one. A live sandbox delivery (2026-08) also
> carried an undocumented `x-square-signature` (HMAC-SHA1) header; don't rely on it.

Node (official Square SDK — recommended):

```javascript
const { WebhooksHelper } = require('square');

// requestBody is the raw HTTP body string; notificationUrl must match Square exactly
const isValid = await WebhooksHelper.verifySignature({
  requestBody: rawBody,
  signatureHeader: req.headers['x-square-hmacsha256-signature'],
  signatureKey: process.env.SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY,
  notificationUrl: process.env.SQUARE_WEBHOOK_URL,
});
if (!isValid) return res.status(400).send('Invalid signature');
```

Python (manual — mirrors what the SDK does, timing-safe):

```python
import hmac, hashlib, base64

def is_valid(raw_body: bytes, signature: str, key: str, url: str) -> bool:
    payload = url.encode() + raw_body            # notification URL + raw body
    digest = hmac.new(key.encode(), payload, hashlib.sha256).digest()
    expected = base64.b64encode(digest).decode()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)
```

## Common Event Types

Square delivers the event type in the body's `type` field (not a header).

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `payment.created` | A new payment was created |
| `payment.updated` | A payment changed state (e.g. completed) |
| `refund.created` | A refund was initiated |
| `refund.updated` | A refund changed state |
| `invoice.payment_made` | A payment was made against an invoice |
| `order.created` | An order was created |
| `order.updated` | An order was updated |
| `customer.created` | A new customer was created |

> **For the full event reference**, see [Square Webhook Events](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/webhooks/overview).

## Environment Variables

```bash
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY=your_signature_key   # From the webhook subscription in Developer Console
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-app.com/webhooks/square  # Must match the subscription's notification URL exactly
```

## Local Development

```bash
# Start tunnel (no account needed)
npx hookdeck-cli listen 3000 square --path /webhooks/square
```

When testing locally, set `SQUARE_WEBHOOK_URL` to the public tunnel URL you
registered as the notification URL in Square — the value is part of the signed
content, so a mismatch causes verification to fail.

## Recommended: webhook-handler-patterns

We recommend installing the [webhook-handler-patterns](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/tree/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns) skill alongside this one for handler sequence, idempotency, error handling, and retry logic. Key references (open on GitHub):

- [Handler sequence](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/handler-sequence.md) — Verify first, parse second, handle idempotently third
- [Idempotency](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/idempotency.md) — Prevent duplicate processing (use Square's `event_id`)
- [Error handling](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/error-handling.md) — Return codes, logging, dead letter queues
- [Retry logic](https://github.com/hookdeck/webhook-skills/blob/main/skills/webhook-handler-patterns/references/retry-logic.md) — Provider retry schedules, backoff patterns
