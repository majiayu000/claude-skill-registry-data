# Creative Calendar

Plan and schedule creative production.

## Process

### Step 1: Assess Current Creative Inventory

**Inventory Audit:**
- Active winners (still performing)
- Testing creatives (in flight)
- In production (being made)
- Retired (fatigued/failed)

**Categorize By:**
- Angle/concept
- Format (video/static/carousel)
- Hook type
- Avatar targeted
- Platform optimized

### Step 2: Identify Gaps

**Gap Analysis:**
- Which angles haven't been tested?
- Which formats are underrepresented?
- Which avatars lack content?
- Which platforms need optimization?

**Seasonal Gaps:**
- Upcoming holidays/events
- Seasonal relevance opportunities
- Trend-based content needs

**Performance Gaps:**
- Angles that need refreshing
- Winners needing variations
- Failing areas needing new approaches

### Step 3: Schedule Production Priorities

**Priority Framework:**
1. Variations of winners (lowest risk, highest ROI)
2. New hooks on proven angles
3. New angles based on learnings
4. Experimental/innovative concepts
5. Seasonal/timely content

**Production Cadence:**
- Weekly: [X] new variations
- Bi-weekly: [X] new concepts
- Monthly: [X] major productions

### Step 4: Allocate Resources

**Resource Types:**
- Internal creative team
- UGC creators
- Founder/expert shoots
- Stock/AI generation
- Editing capacity

**Capacity Planning:**
- Team member hours available
- Creator slots available
- Budget for production
- Timeline constraints

### Step 5: Output Production Calendar
