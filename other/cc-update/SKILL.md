  Update Claude Code (the CC CLI / "clog code") to a new version, or bump the pinned CC
  version. Use when the user asks to update Claude Code, bump the CC pin, evaluate a new CC
  release, or says "clog code update". Routes to the canonical, standardized process in
  docs/reference/cc-compatibility.md — do NOT re-derive the update mechanism by grepping every
  time. Do NOT use for general "what changed in CC" trivia with no intent to update.

# CC Update — start from the canonical source, don't rediscover

Genesis's Claude Code update process is fully standardized. This skill exists so a session
**executes** that process instead of re-deriving it (grep archaeology every time). If you find
yourself hunting for where the pin lives or how the host updates, STOP and read the doc.

## Authoritative source — read these FIRST
- `docs/reference/cc-compatibility.md` → **§Updating Claude Code (host + container)** (the exact
  steps) and **§CC Update Evaluation Checklist** (the 8-lens impact eval).
- The pin is the single source of truth: `CC_VERSION` (+ `NODE_MAJOR`) in
  `scripts/lib/cc_version.sh`.

## The process in one breath — step numbers MATCH §Updating Claude Code in the doc
> Deliberately the same numbering in both files: "step 4" means the same thing in each. The doc is
> authoritative for detail; this is the one-breath version. If a number here disagrees with the
> doc, the doc wins — and that disagreement is a bug worth fixing rather than working around.

**Pick the target before anything else.** `npm view @anthropic-ai/claude-code version` gives
`latest`; use an explicit older version if you are deliberately not chasing latest. Every step below
is defined over `(pinned, target]`, so nothing can begin until `target` is fixed — and re-picking it
later restarts the procedure (step 5).

> ### ⛔ GATE — FULL CHANGELOG READ. MANDATORY, NO EXCEPTIONS. (part of step 1, before any triage)
> **Read EVERY release entry in `(pinned, target]` IN FULL before step 1's triage.** No pin bump
> proceeds without this.

> (`grep -c '^## <target>$'`) — a stale copy fails exactly that, which is how it would otherwise
> pass unnoticed while the whole new range goes unread. Do NOT *also* require the FIRST heading to

1. **Evaluate** — intake, the ⛔ GATE above, then triage.
   *Intake, never from scratch:* `memory_recall` + `docs/reference/cc-compatibility.md` §Known
   Issues / §Version History + `npm view @anthropic-ai/claude-code@<target> engines.node` + a quick
   community sweep (Reddit/forums) for regressions the changelog omits.
   *Triage:* `recon_cc_update_check(old, new)` MCP (backed by
   `src/genesis/recon/cc_update_analyzer.py`). **Know its real coverage:** today it fetches only the
   newest 5 GitHub releases, matches the **target** version's tag, and truncates that body at 1000
   chars — so on a multi-release jump it sees a fraction of ONE release, or **NOTHING at all once the
   TARGET's own tag ages out of the newest 5**. That is likely mid-soak: step 5 holds a candidate for
   2-3 days while CC ships ~daily. **When that happens the LLM is never called at all** —
   `_fetch_changelog` returns `""`, and `analyze` gates the LLM path on
   `if self._router and changelog`, so it falls through to a hand-built dict with
   `details="Changelog not available"`. The confident-looking `informational` verdict in that case
   is a **deterministic fallback, not a judgement** — do not read it as "the analyzer looked and
   found nothing".
   **Two traps in reading that verdict.** (a) `_fetch_changelog` returns `""` from *five* distinct
   paths — a non-zero `gh` exit, a timeout, a bare `except`, a non-list payload, and the
   tag-not-in-newest-5 case. An expired `gh` auth produces a byte-identical
   `details="Changelog not available"`, so confirm `gh auth status` before concluding the tag aged
   out. (b) There is a SECOND non-judgement path: when the LLM *was* called and failed, the keyword
   heuristic also returns `informational` with real changelog text. Tell them apart by the
   `" (LLM analysis unavailable)"` suffix on `summary` — without that suffix and with a non-empty
   `details`, the verdict is a genuine LLM read. (A whole-`(old, new]`
   map-reduce rewrite exists on an **unmerged** branch — *unmerged as of 2026-08-26; grep the file
   before relying on it*. It would still omit the oldest chunks on a very large range, so **the GATE
   does not retire** either way.) Triage every hooks / MCP / CLI-flag / subagent / permissions delta.
   **Rule: a changelog claim that "we depend on X" only gates the bump if verified against LIVE
   usage** — the TodoWrite lesson: a removed feature Genesis measured 0 uses of is hygiene, not a
   blocker.
   - **Take the PRE-align model-alias sample HERE, in step 1.** It belongs to the *first* never
     skippable step, not to step 2 — step 2 has a legitimate skip condition, and a sample nested
     under it silently disappears exactly when that skip fires, leaving the step-4 "after" reading
     with nothing to compare against. It cannot move later either: step 3 replaces the CLI, so this
     is the last point at which the old binary is still installed. See §Model-alias drift below for
     the invocation; the post-align half is step 4.
2. **Deploy current `main` FIRST** — `scripts/update.sh` **detached from the session** (the
   `systemd-run --user` recipe in the genesis-development skill's Timeout Policy; NOT
   `run_in_background`, which is session-bound and has killed deploys mid-run), BEFORE aligning
   the candidate, so the soak runs on current code. Otherwise step 8 lands accumulated Genesis change
   AND the CC bump together and you cannot attribute a regression to either.
   **Checkable skip condition — three parts, all required:** `git fetch origin` first (an unfetched
   `origin/main` is stale and produces a false "already current"); take the newest
   `update_history_recent` row **whose `status == "success"`** — the tool deliberately returns every
   attempt including `failure` and `rolled_back` (`update_history.py:98-113`), and a failed attempt's
   later timestamp otherwise reads as evidence of a deployment that never happened; then confirm that
   row's `new_commit` is an ancestor-or-equal of the fetched `origin/main` head — mechanically,
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor "$(git rev-parse origin/main)" <new_commit>` exits 0. Skip only if
   all three hold.
3. **Align the CONTAINER ONLY to the candidate.**
   ```bash
   source scripts/lib/cc_version.sh   # NOTE: this sets CC_VERSION to the repo PIN
   CC_VERSION=<candidate>             # standalone assignment, AFTER the source
   cc_ensure_local
   cc_shadow_scan
   ```
   ⚠️ **Never write `CC_VERSION=<candidate> cc_ensure_local` and then a bare `cc_shadow_scan`.** An
   assignment *prefix* on a **function** call does not persist past that call, so the scan would run
   on the OLD pin while the container is on the candidate — and if any copy sits at the old pin it
   crowns that one canonical and **deletes the freshly-installed candidate**
   (`cc_version.sh:251`). Full rationale: doc §Updating step 3.
   `claude --version` is NOT sufficient here: it spawns a **fresh child**, which reads the new
   on-disk binary and truthfully reports the candidate while the session asking the question is
   still executing the old one. Run `scripts/check_cc_running_versions.sh` instead — it compares
   each live process's actual mapped binary against the one on disk.
   **Check the Node floor first** — `npm view @anthropic-ai/claude-code@<candidate> engines.node`
   vs `node -v`. If it rises above the container's Node, **STOP**: no container-side Node transition
   tool exists today (`install.sh:473-477` hardcodes `>= 20` and never reads `NODE_MAJOR`), and a
   failed align is not a clean no-op — `npm install -g` has already replaced the working CC before
   the verify runs.
4. **Validate the CANDIDATE against candidate-shaped expectations, not step 9's.** During the soak
   the correct state is **container == candidate, host == old pin** — step 9 requires BOTH to equal
   the pin, which cannot hold yet. Run the critical paths, the doc's §Known Issues, and each behavior the
   impact eval flagged; any Guardian-path check exercises the **host's old** binary, so
   candidate-specific Guardian behavior needs a container-side exercise.
   - **Run `scripts/check_cc_running_versions.sh` BEFORE validating, not just before the soak.**
     Same trap as step 3 and step 5: validation performed inside a session still mapped to the
     replaced binary is evidence about the OLD release, and it is the evidence the whole changelog
     gate feeds into. The check belongs at every point that produces evidence about the candidate —
     steps 3, 4, 5 and 9 — not only at the soak boundary.
   - **Take the POST-align model-alias sample here** and compare it against the pre-align one from
     step 2 — nothing else in the system will catch an alias remap. See §Model-alias drift below
     for the invocation and for which `modelUsage` entry to read (it is not the first one).
5. **Soak 2–3 days** under real use — but **the clock does not start until every interactive
   session is actually ON the candidate.** A long-running CC process keeps its original binary
   mapping until it restarts; npm replaces the package underneath it. So relaunch the foreground
   sessions, then prove it rather than assuming it:
   ```bash
   scripts/check_cc_running_versions.sh    # exit 0 required before the clock starts
   ```
   Re-run it at soak END too — sessions started mid-soak are fine, but one that predates the align
   and was never relaunched has been contributing evidence about the OLD release the whole time.
   *Origin (measured on a live install):* a soak was declared started and ran its full length with
   **a majority of live CC processes — and most interactive sessions — still executing the replaced
   predecessor**. `cc_shadow_scan` was clean throughout (it scans on-disk copies, not running
   processes) and `claude --version` reported the candidate the whole time, because it spawns a
   fresh child. Nothing in the procedure would have caught it.

   Rollback is one command: `source scripts/lib/cc_version.sh &&
   CC_VERSION=<pin> cc_ensure_local`. Do NOT run `update.sh` during the soak — it `unset`s any
   inherited `CC_VERSION` and re-aligns the container to the pin, reverting the candidate. Proceed
   to the public pin only after soak + explicit user sign-off.
   - **Mid-soak drift (CC ships ~daily, so `latest` WILL move during the soak):** re-target to a
     newer release mid-cycle ONLY if it fixes something touching our workflow / soak safety / a known
     issue (e.g. 2.1.245→246 fixed a background-retention sweep that reaped user-created
     `.claude/worktrees/`). Otherwise finish the soak on the pinned target and roll the delta into
     the next cycle — never silently chase-latest.
   - **A re-target RESTARTS the procedure from step 1.** New target ⇒ the durable changelog-gate row
     no longer covers the range, the candidate validation ran against a different binary, and the
     2–3 day clock resets. Otherwise you publish a target with hours of real use — defeating the gate
     exactly for the workflow-affecting releases that justify re-targeting.
6. **Bump the pin** — `CC_VERSION` in `scripts/lib/cc_version.sh`; bump `NODE_MAJOR` **in the same
   file** only if the new CC raises its `engines.node` floor (the `cc-node-lockstep` CI job,
   `scripts/check_cc_node_lockstep.py`, fails the PR otherwise). In the same PR update
   `docs/reference/cc-compatibility.md`: §Current CC Version, a §Version History row **carrying the
   changelog-gate clause from step 1**, and any new caveats.
7. **PR → CI green** (incl. `cc-node-lockstep`) → **privacy scan** →
   **explicit user approval** → squash-merge. Then `git pull --rebase origin main`.
   Both gate receipts go in the PR body as trailers — the merge gate blocks a pin-forward PR
   without them (a pin that moves *backward* is exempt; rollback is the incident-recovery path):
   ```
   CC-Gate-Changelog: read (2.1.X, 2.1.Y] in full from <source>, <date>
   CC-Gate-Soak: <candidate> on container <start>..<end>, check_cc_running_versions.sh clean, sign-off recorded
   ```
8. **Host-Deploy Gate** — in the SAME session after merge, run `scripts/update.sh` from `~/genesis`
   **detached from the session** (same recipe as step 2 — deploys exceed the Bash tool's hard
   ceiling, and `run_in_background` is session-bound): it aligns the **container**
   (`cc_ensure_local`) AND the **host VM** (guardian `update-cc` op) to the pin, idempotently.
   Note the nightly `genesis-cc-align.timer` is **host-only** — `cc_align_host.sh` calls
   `cc_align_host_sync` and never `cc_ensure_local`, so it closes HOST drift between updates and
   (usefully) will **not** silently revert a container candidate mid-soak.
9. **Post-deploy validation (SAME session) — critical paths AND known/tabled issues, not just a
   smoke.** Container + host `claude --version` == pin (host via the gateway `version` op /
   a FRESH gateway `version` op — **not** `~/.genesis/host_gateway_state.json`, which is written
   from the PRE-alignment probe and not refreshed after `update-cc`, so it reports the OLD
   version until the nightly timer runs); guardian tick healthy; a CCInvoker / headless `claude -p`
   smoke on a **FRESH** process (this foreground session keeps its OLD binary until relaunch);
   **re-check the doc's §Known Issues + any tabled CC bugs against the new version**; and verify each
   behavior the impact eval flagged (e.g. an MCP arg-typing or `-p` result-shape change) on the live
   path, not just that the flag still parses.
10. **Leverage + capture** — for each newly-available capability Genesis would want, file the
   detection→behavior follow-up (below). Store what was learned to memory + this doc + the KB so the
   next update stays execute-not-rediscover.

## Delegating the full changelog read (the GATE — part of step 1)

You may hand the read to a sub-agent — but it must be done **with the same context and scrutiny you
would apply yourself**. A generic "read this changelog and tell me what you think" is NOT the gate:
the agent lacks the Genesis impact surfaces, so it returns feature summaries instead of consequences.
Brief it with THIS (adapt the range/source):

> FIRST confirm `~/tmp/cc_changelog.md` CONTAINS a `## <target>` heading; if it does not, re-fetch
> before reading (`mkdir -p ~/tmp` first):
> `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/main/CHANGELOG.md -o ~/tmp/cc_changelog.md`
> (nothing maintains that file — a stale copy makes this whole review vacuous).
>
> Read EVERY release entry in `(<pinned>, <target>]` IN FULL. Do NOT summarize generically, and do
> NOT treat the newest release as already-known — the load-bearing item can sit anywhere, **including
> deep inside the newest release** (that is exactly what the last miss looked like). For each release,
> judge every entry against these Genesis
> impact surfaces and report only entries with a concrete Genesis consequence, tagged
> **RISK** (could break us) / **GAIN** (fixes something we hit) / **LEVERAGE** (new capability we'd want):
> - **Hooks** — PreToolUse approval gate, `bash_safety_hook`, review-enforcement hooks; exit-code-2
>   blocking semantics, `additionalContext`, matcher parsing (Genesis uses `matcher` only — no `if`
>   conditions); **and the hook INPUT PAYLOAD SHAPE** — a renamed/removed field silently disables
>   every guard (see `tests/test_scripts/test_hook_input_contract.py`).
> - **MCP** — our servers under `claude -p --mcp-config`; arg typing (incl. empty-`{}` schemas),
>   connect/reconnect, interrupted-call reporting, tool-search/deferred tools.
> - **`claude -p` / CCInvoker** — output/result JSON shape, `modelUsage`, resume/continue,
>   mid-stream error handling, stdin/stdout.
> - **Flags Genesis actually passes** — `-p`, `--output-format json`, `--model`, `--effort`,
>   `--append-system-prompt`, `--mcp-config`, `--strict-mcp-config`, `--allowedTools`,
>   `--disallowedTools`, `--bare`, `--max-turns`, `--resume`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
>   (full table: `docs/reference/cc-compatibility.md` §Integration Surface).
> - **Guardian host recovery** — the host VM's diagnosis call: a DIFFERENT machine, and the
>   highest-stakes CC call in the system. Actual shape (`src/genesis/guardian/diagnosis.py:546-555`):
>   `claude -p --model <cfg> --output-format json [--effort <cfg>] --max-turns <cfg>
>   --dangerously-skip-permissions`, **plus `--mcp-config <path> --strict-mcp-config` only when
>   `config/no_mcp.json` exists** (otherwise it logs a warning and runs without them). Defaults:
>   model `opus`, effort `high`, max-turns 50. So a change to `--effort` semantics, or to
>   `--mcp-config`/`--strict-mcp-config` handling, lands squarely on this call.
> - **Subagents / workflows** — spawn depth defaults, fork/background defaults, `maxTurns`
>   behavior, concurrency caps.
> - **Skills / slash commands / plugins** — auto-invocation changes, skill discovery + frontmatter,
>   plugin loading (2.1.215 removed CC's proactive `/code-review` + `/verify`, making Genesis's own
>   review-enforcement hooks the primary trigger rather than a backstop).
> - **Permissions / auto mode / Monitor** — anything changing what is auto-approved.
> - **Worktrees** — an active install can carry dozens; isolation, retention sweeps, `--worktree`.
> - **Cross-session** — `SendMessage`/`ListAgents`, sockets in rootless containers.

Then **verify before you trust it**: independently re-derive the load-bearing findings (the ones that
would gate the bump or change our code) from the changelog text and the actual Genesis code —
refute-by-default, per the "verify multi-agent output" rule. The delegation saves you reading time,
not judgment.

**And verify COVERAGE separately from accuracy — they fail differently.** Re-deriving the findings
the agent returned can only catch findings that are *wrong*; it cannot detect releases the agent
never opened. From CC **2.1.246 onward** — which the pin now is, though an install may be running
something else, so check what the delegating session is ACTUALLY on rather than assuming the
pin — a subagent that hits `maxTurns` returns **partial output without
failing**, so a silent stop two-thirds through the range is indistinguishable from a genuinely short
report. Close that by construction: enumerate every `## ` release heading in `(pinned, target]`
yourself (`grep -n '^## ' ~/tmp/cc_changelog.md`), and require the agent to acknowledge each release
explicitly — including the ones it judged irrelevant. Reconcile the two lists before marking the
gate done. Any release without an acknowledgement means the gate is **not** done, no matter how
good the returned findings look. Ask for the per-release acknowledgement in the brief, not
afterwards — a re-ask cannot recover context the agent already dropped.

## Model-alias drift — CHECK IT BY HAND, nothing watches it
`--model opus` (and every alias) silently re-points to a new full model id when Anthropic bumps the
family — **measured live: `opus` resolved `claude-opus-4-8` → `claude-opus-5` across a CC bump**,
with no warning anywhere. This is NOT a downgrade, so the tier-based downgrade detector is blind to
it, and **no drift detector exists on `main` today** — there is nothing to alert you.

So take **two samples, and mind where each one goes**: the PRE-align sample is a **step 1** item
(step 3 replaces the CLI, so step 4 is too late for a "before" reading), and the POST-align sample
is a step-4 item. It belongs in step 1 specifically, **not step 2** — step 2 carries an explicit
skip condition, and a reader who skips it would keep only the post-align value, leaving alias
remapping undetectable because there is nothing to compare against.

```bash
claude -p --model <alias> --output-format json 'ok'   # <alias> = opus | sonnet | haiku
```

**Pass `--model <alias>` explicitly.** Production supplies it — `CCInvoker._build_args` appends
`["--model", str(inv.model)]` — so omitting it samples whatever default the environment resolves,
which is not the mapping under test. (Cite symbols, not line numbers: this file's line numbers
differ between refs, and a stale number sends the reader to unrelated code.)

**`modelUsage` can list MORE THAN ONE model, and dict order is not tier order.** CC's auxiliary
haiku calls (titles/topics) appear alongside the main model; taking the first key false-positived
downgrade detection on a sonnet session that listed `{haiku, sonnet-5}` (2026-07-09), which is why
`CCInvoker._parse_result_dict` selects the max by `_TIER_RANK` rather than the first key
(`tests/test_cc/test_invoker.py::test_parse_result_dict_ignores_auxiliary_model_for_downgrade`).
For drift the failure direction is a **miss**, not a false alarm: compare the auxiliary entry on
both sides and it looks stable while the main model has been remapped.

⚠️ **Do not simply copy "take the highest tier" — that ranking BREAKS on the exact case you are
looking for.** `CCModel.from_full_name` returns `None` for any id containing no known tier keyword,
and `_TIER_RANK.get(None, -1)` ranks it **below haiku**. So if the alias remaps to a model family
Genesis does not yet recognise — precisely alias drift — the max-by-tier pick silently returns the
auxiliary haiku, and the very code cited above reports the wrong model. You cannot rank an id you
have never seen, and neither can it.

So read it this way instead: **compare the SETS**. List every key of `modelUsage` before and after.
If a key present after is absent before, that is your answer regardless of tier — investigate it,
and if its family is unrecognised, that is itself a finding (Genesis's downgrade detection is blind
to that id until `CCModel` learns it). Only fall back to the tier ranking when both sides contain
exactly the same recognised families.

(Note `model_used` is a Genesis-side `CCOutput` attribute, NOT a field of the raw `claude -p` JSON.)


The posture is deliberate *float* (accept the newer model), but floating without checking means the
model behind every CCInvoker and experiment call can change unnoticed.

## Durable facts (don't re-derive; verify against the doc if a memory contradicts this)
- **Both container and host install CC via npm-global — there is NO native-installer path**
  (`/usr/bin/claude` → `/usr/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code`; container under its own
  npm prefix). One canonical copy per machine, enforced by `cc_shadow_scan`. (If a stored memory
  claims the host uses the native installer, it is stale — the doc is authoritative.)
- `origin` = **`GENesis-AGI`** = the **public** repo — merging the pin publishes it; installs pull
  it via `update.sh`. There is no separate private→public step.
- Auto-updater is disabled (`DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` / `DISABLE_UPDATES` in user-level
  `~/.claude/settings.json`), so the pin is the only mover; an ad-hoc `npm i -g` gets healed back
  to the pin on the next align run.
- Downgrade is supported and deliberate — the pin can go DOWN and `update-cc <older>` rolls the
  host back; there is NO `requiredMinimumVersion` floor (it would remove the incident-recovery
  path and can brick CC).

## Watch-items a CC bump can change under Genesis
Genesis leans on CC internals; a release can shift them silently. When evaluating, check whether
the delta touches:
- **Hooks** — exit-code-2 blocking semantics, `additionalContext`, matcher parsing (our approval
  gate + `bash_safety_hook` + review-enforcement hooks depend on these).
- **Subagents** — nesting default + `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH` /
  `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS` (2.1.217 made nesting opt-in); and whether
  workflow/subagent file-writes still hit our PreToolUse approval gate under `claude -p`.
- **Skills/commands** — e.g. 2.1.215 removed CC's proactive `/code-review` + `/verify`
  auto-invocation (Genesis's own review-enforcement layer is now the primary trigger, not a
  backstop).
- **`--flags` Genesis passes** (`--model`, `--mcp-config`, `--bare`, `-p`, `--append-system-prompt`).

Capture any such change as a GitHub issue + a doc entry — that is how the next update stays
execute-not-rediscover.

## Detection → behavior (new-capability adoption path)

The impact eval treats a new feature as *informational* by design ("available"
is not "required") — correct for alerting, but it left no path from "detected"
to "Genesis actually starts using it". So, when the changelog review flags a
NEW skill/command/flag that Genesis would plausibly WANT (it overlaps an
existing Genesis workflow, replaces a hand-rolled mechanism, or covers a known
gap), do BOTH:

1. File the informational KB entry as usual (no alert — calibration unchanged).
2. File a GitHub ISSUE (see the mechanics in `.claude/docs/mcp-tools-guide.md`) naming
   the SPECIFIC instruction change — editing a skill or CLAUDE.md is repo work,
   so it belongs on the public tracker. At THIS step the selected pin is already
   deployed and validated (steps 8-9), so the issue alone is enough — do NOT add a
   `blocked_on_trigger` row here; it would record a blocker already satisfied and,
   since the condition is never evaluated, sit there indefinitely. Add one only for
   a pin genuinely not yet reached, with a `revisit_condition` (the tool
   hard-errors without one). E.g. "once CC >= vX.Y.Z is pinned: prefer
   native `/design` over the gstack `design-*` skills for UI drafting; decide
   precedence and update the relevant skill/CLAUDE.md instruction". A
   capability nobody wires into an instruction is a capability Genesis never
   reaches for.

Origin (2026-08-18): the `/design` research-preview announcement had no route
from detection to adoption; the user asked "how do we make sure you
automatically leverage this when you should?" — this step is the answer.
