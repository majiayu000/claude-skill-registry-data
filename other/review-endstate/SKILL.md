# Review Endstate Changes

A structured review of a diff against Endstate's locked contracts (`docs/contracts/`), public commitments (`PRINCIPLES.md`), and Go-quality posture. Output is a four-section verdict the user can act on before merge.

## Step 1 — Determine diff scope (ask if ambiguous)

Before reading anything, confirm what to review. If the user did not specify, ask:

> Which diff should I review?
> 1. Current uncommitted changes (`git diff` + `git diff --cached` + untracked)
> 2. A branch against `main` (`git diff main...<branch>`)
> 3. A specific GitHub PR (`gh pr diff <num>`)

Do not guess. Reviewing the wrong scope wastes the user's time and produces noise.

Once scope is known, capture the changed file list — every check below is conditional on what the diff actually touches.

## Step 2 — Always-read inputs

Read these every review, regardless of diff:

- `PRINCIPLES.md` — the seven public commitments. Pay special attention to:
  - **Principle 1** (the local product is free, forever — no nag screens, no profile/feature limits, no local features gated on subscription status, no telemetry-by-default)
  - **Principle 4** (hosted data is encrypted end-to-end with client-side keys — passphrase and `masterKey` never leave the device; server cannot decrypt)
- `CLAUDE.md` — landmines and protected areas, so the review flags forbidden patterns.

## Step 3 — Conditional contract reads

Read each contract only if the diff touches its domain. Cite the specific section number when flagging a violation.

| Diff touches | Read |
|---|---|
| `go-engine/internal/backup/**`, hosted backup auth/crypto, JWT/JWKS, KDF, encryption envelope, R2 storage layout, subscription state | `docs/contracts/hosted-backup-contract.md` |
| Any `--json` envelope, error shapes, error codes, `cliVersion`/`schemaVersion`, `endstate capabilities` | `docs/contracts/cli-json-contract.md` |
| Anything emitted to stderr as JSONL, phase/item/summary/error/artifact events, `--events jsonl` | `docs/contracts/event-contract.md` |
| Capabilities handshake, GUI ↔ engine boundary, anything the GUI reads | `docs/contracts/gui-integration-contract.md` |
| Capture artifact layout, profile composition, restore safety, config portability | `docs/contracts/capture-artifact-contract.md`, `profile-contract.md`, `restore-safety-contract.md`, `config-portability-contract.md` |

If the diff modifies behavior covered by a spec under `openspec/specs/`, confirm the same commit (or branch) carries a corresponding `openspec/changes/<id>/` proposal.

## Step 4 — Project-specific checklist

Run each check against the diff. Skip checks that don't apply (e.g., no new HTTP routes → skip ownership check); never skip because "it probably looks fine."

- [ ] **API version header.** Any new substrate API call site verifies that the response carries `X-Endstate-API-Version: 1.0` (or compatible major). Refuses to write on major mismatch; warns on minor mismatch for read paths. (`hosted-backup-contract.md` §11)
- [ ] **Ownership + 404, not 403.** Any new authenticated route enforces `userId` from JWT == `userId` on the row, AND returns 404 (not 403) on cross-user access to avoid existence leaks. (`hosted-backup-contract.md` §7 "Ownership enforcement")
- [ ] **Crypto hygiene.** Any new crypto code uses `crypto/rand` exclusively (no `math/rand`). AES-GCM nonces are freshly generated per call from CSPRNG. Auth tags are verified before any plaintext is returned to the caller. AAD binds chunk index where chunks are involved. (`hosted-backup-contract.md` §3)
- [ ] **Error envelope.** Any new error path returns the standard envelope (`success: false`, `error.code` SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, `error.message`, optional `detail`/`remediation`/`docsKey`). No bare strings, no ad-hoc shapes. (`cli-json-contract.md` "Error Object")
- [ ] **Event ordering.** Any new streaming output respects ordering invariants — first event is `phase`, monotonic phase transitions, last event is `summary`, schema v1 required fields (`version`, `runId`, `timestamp`, `event`). (`event-contract.md` §"Event Fundamentals" and §"Schema v1")
- [ ] **Stdout vs stderr split.** Any new command emits the JSON envelope on **stdout** and streaming events on **stderr** (`[Console]::Error.WriteLine()` equivalent in Go). Never mix.
- [ ] **OpenSpec coupling.** If the change modifies behavior covered by an existing spec, the same commit references an `openspec/changes/<id>/` proposal. New behavior without a spec change is a missing artifact.
- [ ] **Tests for new behavior.** New behavior has new tests under the matching `*_test.go` (e.g., changes in `internal/commands/restore.go` add cases to `internal/commands/restore_test.go`). Tests are hermetic — no real winget calls, no network, no shared state. Match the table-driven, single-purpose pattern in existing `_test.go` files.
- [ ] **JSONC parsing.** Any new code reading a `.jsonc` file uses `manifest.StripJsoncComments` before unmarshalling. Raw `json.Unmarshal` on `.jsonc` is forbidden. (`CLAUDE.md` Landmine #1)
- [ ] **Capabilities reflect CLI changes.** New or changed CLI flags/commands appear in the `capabilities` output.
- [ ] **Restore entries back up.** Restore entries carry `backup: true`; capture/restore paths never include secrets or credentials.
- [ ] **UX language (only if user-facing strings change).** New error messages, status reasons, or progress strings line up with `docs/ux-language.md` (lives in the GUI repo `endstate-gui`). If unavailable to read, flag it as "verify against GUI repo before merge" rather than silently passing.

## Step 5 — Go-quality checklist

- [ ] **Sensitive buffers zeroed.** Passphrase bytes, derived `masterKey`, DEK, and any plaintext key material are zeroed (`for i := range b { b[i] = 0 }`) immediately after use. Don't rely on GC.
- [ ] **Errors carry context.** Errors are wrapped with `fmt.Errorf("doing X: %w", err)` not returned bare. Caller-visible errors at command boundaries map to a stable `error.code`.
- [ ] **Deferred cleanup.** Every `Open`/`Create`/`NewWriter`/transaction has a matching `defer Close()` (or equivalent), placed immediately after the success check.
- [ ] **Dependency justification.** Any new entry in `go-engine/go.mod` is justified — the project's posture is minimal-dependency and audit-friendly. Prefer stdlib; if a third-party module is added, the review notes the reason. Crypto deps in particular need to be widely-used and well-audited (e.g., `golang.org/x/crypto` over a one-author module).

## Step 6 — Output

Produce exactly four sections, in this order. Every item names the file and (where useful) the line number, and cites the contract section when applicable.

```
### Blocking issues
Items that violate a locked contract, principle, or invariant. Must be fixed before merge.

### Should fix
Items that are likely defects or near-future maintenance debt. Catch before merge if possible.

### Worth considering
Subjective design or style notes. Take or leave.

### Off-contract behavior
Anywhere the diff disagrees with a contract — name the contract and the section.
Even if the user accepts the divergence, the contract must be amended in the same change.
```

If a section is empty, write `_None._` rather than omitting it. Empty sections signal that the check was actually performed.

## Boundary rules

- **Don't review with insufficient information.** If the diff is too large to load fully, or scope is ambiguous, ask first. A partial review that reads as complete is worse than no review.
- **Don't fabricate.** Don't claim a contract section exists unless verified by reading. Don't claim a file is missing without confirming via `Read` or `Glob`. Quote the contract when flagging a violation.
- **Don't restate the diff.** The user can see the diff. The review is the analysis on top.
- **Don't expand scope.** Do not flag pre-existing issues outside the diff. If you see one and it's important, mention it in `Worth considering` clearly labeled as pre-existing.

## Reference patterns

- Test patterns to match: `go-engine/internal/commands/restore_test.go`, `capture_test.go`, `report_test.go` — table-driven, hermetic, one assertion per test
- OpenSpec change layout: `openspec/changes/add-hosted-backup-contract/` is a current example
