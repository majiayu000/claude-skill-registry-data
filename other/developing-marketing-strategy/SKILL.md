# Developing Marketing Strategy

## Overview
This skill defines the process for creating data-driven marketing strategies, integrating creativity with analytical rigor to drive sustainable growth.

## When to Use
- Developing Go-To-Market (GTM) strategies
- Planning user acquisition campaigns
- Analyzing marketing channels (Paid, SEO, ASO, Social)
- Conducting market or trend research
- Creating budget or content plans

## Core Principles
- **Audience First:** Understand user personas and motivations before tactics.
- **Data-Driven:** Back recommendations with verifiable data or clear hypotheses.
- **Channel Synergy:** Integrate paid, owned, and earned channels.
- **ROI Priority:** Focus on scalable, high-impact opportunities with clear payback.
- **Test & Iterate:** Propose experiments to validate assumptions.
- **Sustainable Growth:** Balance short-term wins with long-term brand equity.
- **Clear Metrics:** Include specific, measurable KPIs.

## Workflow

### 1. Context Gathering
**Goal:** Quickly gather essential context.

1.  Identify target product, business goal, audience, KPIs, and timeline.
2.  Ask up to two clarifying questions if core info is missing.
3.  Load relevant frameworks (e.g., `.github/data/marketing-frameworks.yaml` or equivalent) if available.
4.  Stop gathering once the primary goal is clear.

### 2. Research & Analysis
- **Pre-Research:** Explain goal, query, and success criteria.
- **During Research:** Narrate progress every 2-3 steps.
- **Post-Research:** Summarize facts and how they inform recommendations.
- **Gap Analysis:** If data is missing, state assumption clearly and flag as a gap.

### 3. Strategy Creation
- **Modes:**
    - **Strategy:** GTM plans (`marketing-strategy-tmpl`).
    - **SEO:** SEO roadmaps.
    - **Paid:** Media planning and budgeting.
    - **Social:** Content planning.
- **Self-Reflection (Before Finalizing):**
    - Is it grounded in data?
    - Is it coherent across channels?
    - Are KPIs clear/measurable?
    - Is ROI realistic?
    - Is it creative AND feasible?

### 4. Output Generation
- **Structure:** Use clear headings, lists, tables.
- **Formatting:**
    - Use `backticks` for channel names, campaign names, specific metrics.
    - **Bold** KPIs for scannability.
    - Cite data sources inline (e.g., `[SimilarWeb, web_search]`).
- **Location:** ALWAYS create documents in `docs/marketing/`.
- **Prohibition:** NEVER write to internal AI directories for outputs. Use project-specific output locations.

## Common Mistakes
- Proposing tactics without defining the audience first.
- Recommending strategies without clear KPIs.
- Failing to cite sources for market data.
