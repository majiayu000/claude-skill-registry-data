# Customer Insights & Telemetry Skill

## When to Use
- Building segment-specific lifecycle journeys.
- Prioritizing accounts for adoption help, expansion offers, or advocacy invites.
- Diagnosing churn/retention risks and surfacing insights to CS + product.

## Framework
1. **Signals Stack** – product usage, engagement, sentiment, commercial, health composite.
2. **Data Plumbing** – define sources (warehouse, product analytics, CS tools) and refresh cadence.
3. **Normalization** – align account/user IDs, tag personas/verticals.
4. **Insight Delivery** – dashboards + alerts to lifecycle, CS, product teams.
5. **Closed Loop** – track outcomes (expansion booked, churn prevented, advocacy activated).

## Templates
- Health score schema (dimensions, weight, threshold, owner).
- Insight brief (observation, impact, recommended play, owner, due date).
- Data dictionary for lifecycle dashboards.

## Tips
- Keep manual notes from CSMs in sync with telemetry to avoid blind spots.
- Tag signals by persona/vertical for more precise plays.
- Automate distribution via Slack/email alerts tied to triggers.
