# Onboarding Flows

## Why Onboarding Matters

**Goal:** Get users to "aha moment" as quickly as possible

### Without Good Onboarding
```
User signs up → Confused → Abandons → Never returns
```

### With Good Onboarding
```
User signs up → Guided setup → Achieves first success → Becomes active user
```

---

## Onboarding Goals

### 1. Show Value Quickly
```
Don't: 10-step setup before user sees product
Do: Show core value in first 30 seconds
```

### 2. Reduce Time to First Success
```
Measure: Time from signup to first "aha moment"
Goal: Minimize this time
```

### 3. Build Habit
```
Get user to complete key action 3 times in first week
```
