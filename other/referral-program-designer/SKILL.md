# Referral Program Designer

Create referral programs that turn happy customers into active promoters. This skill helps you design incentive structures, referral mechanics, and program experiences that motivate sharing and drive cost-effective customer acquisition.

Referrals are the gold standard of marketing - lower CAC, higher LTV, and built-in social proof. This skill provides frameworks for incentive design, program mechanics, viral loop optimization, and measurement. Learn from programs like Dropbox, Uber, and Airbnb to build referral engines that fuel growth.

Built for growth marketers, product managers, founders, and anyone looking to scale acquisition through word-of-mouth.
