# 🧠 Think - Reflective Thought Composition

A structured thinking process for complex problem analysis.

## When to Use

- When facing complex tasks requiring structured reasoning
- When asked to "think deeply" about a problem
- When planning complex implementations
- When evaluating trade-offs between approaches

## Process

For each step, show your work:

```
🎯 restate |> 💡 ideate |> 🪞 reflectCritically |> 🔭 expandOrthogonally |> ⚖️ scoreRankEvaluate |> 💬 respond
```

### Steps Explained

| Step | Emoji | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Restate** | 🎯 | Clarify the problem in your own words |
| **Ideate** | 💡 | Generate potential solutions/approaches |
| **Reflect Critically** | 🪞 | Examine weaknesses and assumptions |
| **Expand Orthogonally** | 🔭 | Consider alternative perspectives |
| **Score/Rank/Evaluate** | ⚖️ | Compare options systematically |
| **Respond** | 💬 | Deliver the final recommendation |

## Depth Option

Use `--depth` or `-d` to control response detail:

- `-d 1` = ELIF (Explain Like I'm Five) - brief, simple
- `-d 5` = Standard depth - balanced detail
- `-d 10` = PhD prep - comprehensive, thorough

## Constraints

Keep the thinking process concise, compact, and information-dense:
- `d=1`: A few words per step
- `d=10`: A few bullet points per step
