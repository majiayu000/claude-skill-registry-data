# Cross-Industry Research

Find creative inspiration by researching parallel markets.

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Parallel Industries

**Avatar Mapping**
Your target avatar exists in multiple markets. Identify industries where:
- Same demographic shops
- Same psychographic profile
- Same life stage/situation
- Same problems (even if different solutions)

**Example (Busy Moms):**
- Baby products
- Meal delivery
- Fitness programs
- Time management apps
- Cleaning services
- Supplements

**Example (Health-Conscious 50+):**
- Supplements
- Medical devices
- Insurance
- Travel
- Hobbies/activities
- Financial services

### Step 2: Research Top Brands/Ads

**Facebook Ad Library**
- Search industry keywords
- Find longest-running ads
- Download/screenshot winners

**TikTok Top Ads**
- Filter by industry (not your industry)
- Study what's trending
- Note formats and styles

**YouTube/Native**
- VidTao for YouTube ads
- Spy tools for native ads
- Note cross-platform winners

### Step 3: Analyze What's Working

For each winning ad found:

**Angle Identification**
- What's the core message?
- What emotion is triggered?
- What promise is made?

**Framework Analysis**
- How is the ad structured?
- What's the hook type?
- How is proof presented?

**Principle Extraction**
- What DR principle is at play?
- Why does this resonate?
- What's the psychological trigger?

### Step 4: Translate Concepts

**Translation Questions:**
- How can this concept apply to my offer?
- What would this angle look like for my product?
- How can I adapt this framework?
- What would make this BETTER for my market?

**Translation Methods:**
- Same angle, different product
- Same framework, different content
- Same emotional trigger, different proof
- Same format, different topic

## Key Insight

"The core psychological desires of why people buy have NOT changed. The only thing that's really changed is the medium of communication."

What works in one industry likely works in another because human psychology is consistent. You're not reinventing - you're translating.
