# Creative Brief Generator

Generate a comprehensive creative brief using direct response principles and the GET framework from Tyler's 8 Step Ideation system.

## The GET Framework (Detailed)

The GET framework simplifies brand information gathering into a focused, actionable format. This replaced the previous 8+ hour creative briefs with a streamlined approach.

### G - Get (Target Customer/Market Segment)

Identify the specific target customer. When testing new creative, focus on the top-performing, proven market segment first. Scale horizontally to unproven segments later once you have winning ads and angles.

**Questions to Answer:**
- Who is the primary target customer?
- Demographics: age range, gender, location, income level
- Psychographics: values, beliefs, lifestyle, aspirations
- Daily habits: morning routines, media consumption, shopping behavior
- What market segments exist? Which is proven/highest performing?

**Example (Mushroom Coffee):**
- GET: Women 30-60+ struggling with low energy, caffeine habits, or daily crashes
- They want to gain their energy and confidence back every single day
- Using adaptogenic mushrooms as the mechanism

### E - Problems (Surface & Deep)

Brain dump ALL surface-level problems. Do not stop at one - brainstorm extensively. The copywriting process will peel back the onion to find the TRUE underlying problem.

**Surface Level Problems:**
- What immediate issues does the customer face?
- What symptoms are they experiencing?
- What frustrations do they encounter daily?

**Deep Problems (Peel Back the Onion):**
- What is the TRUE underlying problem?
- What emotional pain sits beneath the surface issue?
- What have they tried before that didn't work?
- Why do they feel stuck or hopeless?

**Example:**
- Surface: Low energy, afternoon crashes, caffeine dependency
- Deep: Feeling like they've lost themselves to aging, menopause disrupting their identity, inability to keep up with family/work demands

### T - Two Outcomes (Desired State)

List desired outcomes the specific market segment wants to achieve from the product. Think transformation, not features.

**Questions:**
- What outcomes does the customer want?
- What transformation are they seeking?
- What does success look like for them?
- Before state vs. After state?

**Example:**
- BEFORE: Exhausted, in pain, mood swings, can't play with grandkids
- AFTER: Energized, confident, able to work 8 hours AND play with grandkids

### Buy Triggers (USPs, Mechanisms, Proof)

**Unique Selling Propositions:**
- What makes this product different?
- Why should they buy THIS versus alternatives?

**Unique Mechanism:**
- What is the proprietary method/ingredient/process?
- How does it work differently than competitors?
- What makes it believable?

**Proof Elements:**
- Social proof (reviews, testimonials, user count)
- Authority (expert endorsements, credentials, certifications)
- Results data (statistics, before/after, case studies)
- Media mentions, awards, recognition

## Step-by-Step Brief Creation Process

### Step 1: Gather Brand Info Using GET

Complete the GET framework for the offer. Document everything - keywords, buzzwords, and relevant terminology will be critical later.

### Step 2: Analyze Top & Worst Performers

Review existing ad account data:
- What are the top performing ads? WHY are they working?
- What are the worst performing ads? WHY are they failing?
- Base decisions on present data, not theories
- Learn from mistakes - they reveal what to avoid

### Step 3: Extract Keywords & Buzzwords

From your GET research, identify:
- Industry terminology (technical terms customers use)
- Emotional trigger words (pain language, desire language)
- Power words that resonate with the avatar
- Phrases from customer reviews/testimonials
- Competitor language that's working

### Step 4: Create Target Avatar Profiles

Build detailed avatar profiles:

```
AVATAR: [Name]
- Age/Gender:
- Location:
- Income Level:
- Daily Routine: (morning to night)
- Media Consumption: (what platforms, when, how long)
- Buying Behavior: (impulse vs. researcher, price sensitivity)
- Internal Dialogue: (what they say to themselves)
- External Dialogue: (what they say to others)
- Biggest Fear:
- Biggest Desire:
```

### Step 5: Map Pain Points to Outcomes

| Pain Point | Emotional Impact | Desired Outcome | Product Solution |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| [Surface problem] | [How it makes them feel] | [What they want instead] | [How product solves it] |

## Direct Response Principles to Apply

### LFA Core Desires (Life Force Eight)

These are hardwired human desires that drive purchasing decisions:

1. **Survival/Life Extension** - Health, longevity, avoiding death
2. **Food/Drink** - Taste, nutrition, enjoyment
3. **Freedom from Pain/Danger** - Safety, security, protection
4. **Sexual Companionship** - Attraction, intimacy, relationships
5. **Comfortable Living** - Convenience, ease, comfort
6. **Superiority/Winning** - Status, competition, being the best
7. **Care for Loved Ones** - Protection of family, providing
8. **Social Approval** - Belonging, acceptance, respect

### Learned Wants

Secondary motivators that drive decisions:
- Convenience, speed, and price (bargain at a dollar a day)
- Information and knowledge
- Efficiency and productivity
- Quality and craftsmanship
- Beauty and style

### Intensification

Put claims into ACTION in a clear, concise way the user could replicate at home:
- Before/after demonstrations
- Side-by-side comparisons (like ShamWow)
- Speed/ease demonstrations (show how quick/simple)
- Visual proof of results

**Example:** Instead of saying "cleans better," SHOW it cleaning in real-time, side-by-side with competitor.

### Authority Building

Methods to establish credibility:
- Expert approval (doctors, scientists, industry experts)
- Credentials and certifications
- Brand owned by authority figure
- Celebrity/influencer endorsement
- TikTok green screen effect showing press/media

**Key:** Show authority in an authentic way. The medium has changed (UGC) but psychological desires remain constant.

### Mass Desire

Tap into forces always at play in the public's mind:

1. **Mass Instinct** - Universal human drives
2. **Mass Problem** - Widespread issues affecting many (weight loss, menopause)
3. **Mass Education** - Common knowledge being challenged
4. **Trend Reversal** - Going against conventional wisdom

**Example:** Tire company during WWII - "Tire rubber is important for the military. We want our military to win. Buy tires that last longer so military has more rubber."

### Means-End Chain

Sell the benefit of the benefit:
- Don't sell the coffee -> Sell the energy
- Don't sell the energy -> Sell being better in bed
- Don't sell features -> Sell the transformation

**Example (Mushroom Coffee):** Not selling coffee, not even selling energy - selling "intensifying your orgasm by 50%" or "being able to play with grandkids after 8-hour workday"

### Belief Building

The creative's job is to CREATE BELIEF. Conversion is a byproduct of belief.

**Three elements that create belief:**
1. **Insider Perspective** - Someone who works in the industry
2. **Established Authority** - Expert, doctor, lawyer, public figure
3. **Human-First Story** - Real person who experienced the result

**Key insight:** "If the user watching an ad doesn't believe what they're watching is true, the conversion doesn't happen."

### The Trojan Horse Principle

1. **Story earns attention** - Hook and engage first
2. **Proof builds trust** - Social proof, testimonials, demonstrations
3. **Product comes LAST** - Don't sell too early

"If you sell too early, you're killing the potential of that ad and killing belief."

## Founder Ad Integration (When Applicable)

If the offer has a founder who can appear in creative:

**Why Founder Ads Work:**
- Faces build trust (we're hardwired to track faces before we can read)
- Authenticity is scarce in AI-generated content world
- No one can copy your founder
- Creates long-lasting customer relationships
- Never fatigue - ads last years in accounts

**Founder Brief Questions:**
- What's the craziest thing a customer ever told you?
- Why did you start this?
- What annoys you about your industry?
- What is your brand NOT?
- What's the wildest compliment you've received?

**Key:** Questions, never scripts. Encourage stories, not statements.

## Cross-Industry Ideation Notes

When developing the brief, consider:
- What industries share this avatar? (busy moms buy baby products AND meal delivery)
- What's working in those adjacent industries?
- How can successful concepts translate to this offer?

This opens "blue ocean" opportunities by applying proven angles from saturated industries to less saturated ones.

## Framework Integration

Every ad should fit into a proven framework. Frameworks provide:
- Control variables for testing
- Ability to form hypotheses on performance
- Consistent structure across all creative testing

**Without frameworks:** "If you don't understand what is inside your ads, how are you going to control them? How can you form hypotheses on why they are or are not performing?"
