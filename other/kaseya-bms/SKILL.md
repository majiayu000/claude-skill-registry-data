# Kaseya BMS  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `kaseya-bms-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/kaseya-bms/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/kaseya-bms/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `kaseya-bms-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `kaseya-bms-cli` and `kaseya-bms-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Kaseya BMS has a 433-operation official API and zero CLI ecosystem. This binary covers the whole surface - tickets, CRM, contracts, finance, projects - and mirrors core entities into local SQLite so dispatch questions like 'queue-health', 'stale-tickets', and 'contract-burn' answer instantly without burning the 1500/hour/endpoint rate limit.

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI when an agent or operator needs Kaseya BMS PSA data or actions from the terminal: triaging service-desk queues, checking contract hours before authorizing work, reviewing unbilled time, walking the sales pipeline, or creating and updating tickets. The local SQLite mirror makes it the right choice for repeated analytical questions that would otherwise hammer the rate-limited API.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Kaseya VSA / RMM agent operations (endpoints, patches, scripts) - this CLI only covers the BMS PSA
- Datto Autotask PSA workflows - different product, use an Autotask tool
- IT Glue documentation management - BMS only exposes the integration link, not the IT Glue API
- Sending customer-facing invoices or emails - generate the data here, deliver through BMS itself

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Service-desk pulse
- **`queue-health`**  -  See open ticket volume by queue, priority, and status in one shot, with stale counts flagged before the morning standup.

  _Reach for this when asked how the service desk looks right now - it answers in one local query instead of paging the tickets endpoint._

  ```bash
  kaseya-bms-cli queue-health --agent
  ```
- **`stale-tickets`**  -  List open tickets that have not been touched in N days, oldest first, with account and assignee so nothing rots in the queue.

  _Use this for SLA-risk and aging-ticket questions instead of listing all tickets and filtering by hand._

  ```bash
  kaseya-bms-cli stale-tickets --days 7 --agent
  ```
- **`workload`**  -  Open and in-progress ticket load per assignee, flagging who is overloaded and who has slack before you dispatch the next ticket.

  _Pick this when deciding who should take a ticket; it is one command instead of one query per technician._

  ```bash
  kaseya-bms-cli workload --agent
  ```

### Money on the table
- **`contract-burn`**  -  Per-contract burn picture: hours consumed, open tickets, and how much of the contract period has elapsed - at-risk agreements surface first.

  _Use this before authorizing work on an account - it answers whether the contract still has hours left, fleet-wide, in one call._

  ```bash
  kaseya-bms-cli contract-burn --agent --select items.account,items.contract,items.hours_consumed
  ```
- **`unbilled`**  -  Billable, approved, not-yet-billed time grouped by account, in hours - the month-end ready-to-bill review without the Excel export.

  _Reach for this for any what-is-ready-to-bill question; the answer is local, grouped, and JSON-shaped._

  ```bash
  kaseya-bms-cli unbilled --agent
  ```
- **`pipeline`**  -  Open opportunities grouped by stage with counts, total and weighted value, and slipped-close flags for the Monday sales call.

  _Use this for pipeline and forecast questions instead of paging the opportunities endpoint and aggregating by hand._

  ```bash
  kaseya-bms-cli pipeline --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
kaseya-bms-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Morning queue triage

```bash
kaseya-bms-cli queue-health --agent
```

One local query answers what the dispatcher's three browser tabs used to: open volume by queue, priority, and status with stale flags.

### Find tickets about to rot

```bash
kaseya-bms-cli stale-tickets --days 7 --agent
```

Oldest-first list of untouched open tickets with account and assignee, straight from the local mirror.

### Contract hours at risk, narrowed for agents

```bash
kaseya-bms-cli contract-burn --agent --select items.account,items.contract,items.hours_consumed
```

Fleet-wide consumed hours and period-elapsed per contract, with --select trimming the payload to the three fields an agent actually needs.

### What is ready to bill

```bash
kaseya-bms-cli unbilled --agent
```

Approved, billable, unbilled hours grouped by account - the month-end Excel ritual as one command.

### Monday pipeline prep

```bash
kaseya-bms-cli pipeline --agent
```

Opportunities by stage with weighted value and slipped-close flags, computed over the synced mirror.

## Auth Setup

BMS uses short-lived JWTs. Set KASEYA_BMS_USERNAME, KASEYA_BMS_PASSWORD, and KASEYA_BMS_TENANT (your company name from My Settings in BMS), then run `kaseya-bms-cli auth login` to exchange them for a token - it is stored locally and sent as a Bearer header on every call. If you already have a JWT, set KASEYA_BMS_TOKEN directly. Regional tenants set KASEYA_BMS_BASE_URL (https://api.bms.kaseya.com is the default; EMEA uses https://api.bmsemea.kaseya.com, APAC https://api.bmsapac.kaseya.com, legacy Vorex https://api.vorexlogin.kaseya.com). API users with MFA pass --mfa-code at login.

Run `kaseya-bms-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  kaseya-bms-cli project get <id> --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
kaseya-bms-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
kaseya-bms-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
kaseya-bms-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/kaseya-bms-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `KASEYA_BMS_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `KASEYA_BMS_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
kaseya-bms-cli profile save briefing --json
kaseya-bms-cli --profile briefing project get <id>
kaseya-bms-cli profile list --json
kaseya-bms-cli profile show briefing
kaseya-bms-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Async Jobs

For endpoints that submit long-running work, the generator detects the submit-then-poll pattern (a `job_id`/`task_id`/`operation_id` field in the response plus a sibling status endpoint) and wires up three extra flags on the submitting command:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--wait` | Block until the job reaches a terminal status instead of returning the job ID immediately |
| `--wait-timeout` | Maximum wait duration (default 10m, 0 means no timeout) |
| `--wait-interval` | Initial poll interval (default 2s; grows with exponential backoff up to 30s) |

Use async submission without `--wait` when you want to fire-and-forget; use `--wait` when you want one command to return the finished artifact.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `kaseya-bms-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add kaseya-bms-mcp -- kaseya-bms-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which kaseya-bms-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   kaseya-bms-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `kaseya-bms-cli <command> --help`.
