# Web Testing Skill

Comprehensive web testing: unit, integration, E2E, load, security, visual regression, accessibility.

## Choose the runner and evidence

Inspect repository scripts, installed runner versions and the failure class first. Use the existing unit runner for a unit failure, browser tests for UI behavior, and load tooling only for a requested load/performance question. Do not initialize Vitest, Playwright and k6 together. Load only the relevant reference. Flake fixes require a reproduced cause and stable reruns, not arbitrary sleeps; visual/a11y/performance claims need their respective observed browser checks and metric scope. Track and stop owned preview/test processes.

## Quick Start (examples; select the relevant command)

```bash
npx vitest run                    # Unit tests
npx playwright test               # E2E tests
npx playwright test --ui          # E2E with UI
k6 run load-test.js               # Load tests
npx @axe-core/cli https://example.com  # Accessibility
npx lighthouse https://example.com     # Performance
```

## Testing Strategy (Choose Your Model)

| Model | Structure | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Pyramid | Unit 70% > Integration 20% > E2E 10% | Monoliths |
| Trophy | Integration-heavy | Modern SPAs |
| Honeycomb | Contract-centric | Microservices |

## Scripts

### Initialize Playwright Project
```bash
node ./scripts/init-playwright.js [--ct] [--dir <path>]
```
Use only when a new Playwright setup is requested or required and the repo lacks one. Preserve existing configuration; do not initialize for a targeted test edit.

### Analyze Test Results
```bash
node ./scripts/analyze-test-results.js \
  --playwright test-results/results.json \
  --vitest coverage/vitest.json \
  --output markdown
```
Parses Playwright/Vitest/JUnit results into unified summary.

## CI/CD Integration

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - run: npm run test:unit      # Gate 1: Fast fail
      - run: npm run test:e2e       # Gate 2: After unit pass
      - run: npm run test:a11y      # Accessibility
      - run: npx lhci autorun       # Performance
```
