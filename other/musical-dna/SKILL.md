# Musical DNA Analysis

## Purpose

Extract descriptive musical characteristics from any artist or band **without using their name**, building a vocabulary of sonic qualities for AI music generation, music description, or creative recombination. Replace "sounds like [Artist]" with specific, technique-focused descriptions.

## Core Principle

**How, not who.** Describe techniques, approaches, and sonic qualities rather than referencing artists. This enables:
- Ethical AI music generation
- Precise communication about sound
- Creative recombination of elements
- Genre-independent vocabulary

## Quick Reference: Six Dimensions

| Dimension | What to Analyze |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Rhythmic Foundation | Drums, tempo, bass lines, time signatures |
| Harmonic Architecture | Chords, modes, progressions, melodies |
| Instrumental Techniques | Playing styles, effects, timbres |
| Production Aesthetics | Recording feel, mix, spatial treatment |
| Genre Fusion | Influence integration, innovation points |
| Energy Architecture | Song structure, dynamics, emotional trajectory |

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Select Representative Tracks
Choose 3-5 tracks that capture:
- Their most recognizable sound
- Range across their catalog
- Both typical and boundary-pushing examples

### Step 2: Systematic Deconstruction
Work through each dimension, focusing on specific techniques and approaches.

### Step 3: Extract Prompt-Ready Phrases
Convert observations into standalone descriptive phrases that work without artist context.

## Dimension 1: Rhythmic Foundation

### Drum Character
- **Kit composition**: Acoustic, electronic, hybrid, sampled
- **Stick technique**: Brushes, rods, mallets, standard sticks
- **Snare approach**: Rim shots, ghost notes, cross-stick, tight vs. ringy
- **Kick pattern**: Four-on-floor, syncopated, polyrhythmic, sparse
- **Hi-hat work**: Open/closed patterns, 16th note rides, swung
- **Fill style**: Busy, minimal, tom-heavy, snare rolls

### Time & Tempo
- **Time signatures**: 4/4, 3/4, 6/8, odd meters (5/4, 7/8)
- **Tempo range**: Locked BPM or flexible? Fast, mid, slow?
- **Subdivision emphasis**: 8ths, 16ths, triplets, swung
- **Polyrhythmic layering**: Multiple meters happening simultaneously

### Bass Line DNA
- **Technique**: Fingered, picked, slapped, synth, upright
- **Role**: Rhythmic anchor vs. melodic counterpoint
- **Range**: Sub-bass heavy, mid-focused, full range
- **Kick relationship**: Locked, complementary, independent

**Example Phrases:**
- "Driving 8th-note hi-hat over syncopated kick"
- "Slapped bass with muted ghost notes"
- "Swung triplet feel at 95 BPM"

---

## Dimension 2: Harmonic Architecture

### Chord Progressions
- **Major/minor balance**: Predominantly one or mixed?
- **Modal inflections**: Dorian darkness, Mixolydian brightness
- **Chromatic movement**: Smooth voice leading, sudden shifts
- **Chord density**: Triads, 7ths, extended (9ths, 11ths, 13ths)
- **Harmonic rhythm**: Slow changes (1/bar) or rapid (2+/bar)

### Tonal Centers
- **Key preferences**: Sharp keys, flat keys, open-string friendly
- **Modulation**: None, gradual, sudden, frequent
- **Scale choices**: Natural minor, harmonic minor, pentatonic, modes
- **Dissonance tolerance**: Clean resolution, lingering tension

### Melodic Contour
- **Range**: Wide intervals or narrow
- **Movement**: Stepwise, leaping, arpeggiated
- **Phrase length**: Short punchy or long flowing
- **Repetition balance**: Hooks vs. development

**Example Phrases:**
- "Minor key with Dorian 6th inflection"
- "Slow harmonic rhythm, one chord per 4 bars"
- "Wide interval leaps in vocal melody"

---

## Dimension 3: Instrumental Techniques

### Guitar Approaches
- **Pickup selection**: Bridge (bright), neck (warm), split
- **Tone shaping**: Treble-forward, mid-scoop, bass-heavy
- **Technique**: Fingerpicking, flatpicking, hybrid, percussive
- **Tuning**: Standard, drop D, open tunings, baritone

### Effects Chain
- **Distortion type**: Overdrive, fuzz, high-gain, clean
- **Time-based**: Reverb (room, hall, plate), delay (analog, digital, tape)
- **Modulation**: Chorus, phaser, flanger, tremolo, vibrato
- **Pitch**: Octave, harmonizer, whammy
- **Dynamics**: Compression (heavy, light, none)

### Other Instruments
- **Keys/synth**: Analog warmth, digital precision, organ, piano
- **Percussion**: Auxiliary (tambourine, shaker), world instruments

## Dimension 4: Production Aesthetics

### Spatial Characteristics
- **Environment feel**: Professional studio, live room, bedroom, outdoor
- **Reverb treatment**: Dry, intimate, expansive, cavernous
- **Stereo field**: Wide, narrow, mono-compatible
- **Depth staging**: Everything forward, layered front-to-back

### Mix Philosophy
- **Prominence hierarchy**: Drums-first, vocal-forward, guitar-heavy
- **Frequency allocation**: Each instrument's spectral home
- **Dynamic range**: Compressed, dynamic, limiting
- **Clarity vs. saturation**: Pristine separation vs. glued warmth

### Sonic Texture
- **Signal path**: Clean, saturated, distorted, degraded
- **High frequency**: Bright, airy, rolled-off, harsh
- **Low end**: Tight, boomy, sub-heavy, absent
- **Midrange**: Scooped, present, honky, balanced

**Example Phrases:**
- "Bedroom recording aesthetic with lo-fi saturation"
- "Drum-forward mix with tight low end"
- "Vintage tape warmth with rolled-off highs"

## Dimension 5: Genre Fusion Analysis

### Influence Mapping
- **Primary foundation**: The dominant genre base (60%+)
- **Secondary elements**: Strong secondary influence (20-30%)
- **Tertiary accents**: Occasional flavor (10% or less)

### Integration Methods
- **Temporal placement**: Genre X in verses, genre Y in choruses
- **Instrumental assignment**: Drums from A, guitars from B
- **Transition approach**: Seamless blend vs. jarring contrast
- **Era mixing**: Vintage techniques + modern production

### Innovation Points
- **Boundary crossing**: Where conventions are broken
- **Novel combinations**: Unexpected genre marriages
- **Signature fusion**: Their unique contribution

**Example Phrases:**
- "Math rock precision over post-punk foundation"
- "Hip-hop production sensibility applied to folk songwriting"
- "Grunge dynamics with shoegaze texture"

---

## Dimension 6: Energy Architecture

### Song Structure
- **Intro character**: Atmospheric, punchy, fade-in, cold start
- **Verse energy**: Pulled back, driving, building
- **Chorus intensity**: Lift, explosion, subtle shift
- **Bridge/breakdown**: Contrast, climax, reflection
- **Outro approach**: Fade, stop, resolve, evolve

### Dynamic Range
- **Intensity curves**: Gradual build, sudden shifts, flat line
- **Peak placement**: Early, middle, late, multiple
- **Release patterns**: Sudden drop, gradual decay

### Emotional Trajectory
- **Mood arc**: Single state, journey, oscillation
- **Tension cycles**: Build-release frequency
- **Climax character**: Cathartic, devastating, transcendent

**Example Phrases:**
- "Slow build across 4 minutes to explosive final chorus"
- "Sudden dynamic drops creating tension"
- "Verse-chorus contrast via density rather than volume"

## Ethical Guidelines

### Do
- Combine elements from multiple analyses
- Focus on techniques and approaches
- Build reusable vocabulary
- Create novel fusions

### Don't
- Copy complete profiles directly
- Replicate signature riffs/melodies
- Use as "sounds like [Artist]" substitute
- Claim to reproduce specific artists

---

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. The Name Drop
**Pattern:** Using artist names as shorthand instead of technique descriptions. "Sounds like Radiohead" instead of describing the actual sonic qualities.
**Why it fails:** Defeats the entire purpose. Artist names are black boxes that convey different things to different people and may produce copyright issues in AI generation.
**Fix:** Never use artist names in final output. For every "sounds like X," unpack what that actually means in terms of rhythm, harmony, production, etc.

### 2. The Single Dimension
**Pattern:** Analyzing only one dimension (usually rhythm or production) while ignoring others. Producing incomplete profiles.
**Why it fails:** Musical identity emerges from interaction of all dimensions. A rhythmic profile without harmonic context is useless for generation.
**Fix:** Force yourself through all six dimensions. Even if an artist seems "about the guitar sound," their rhythmic choices matter.

### 3. The Genre Substitute
**Pattern:** Describing music by genre labels instead of techniques. "Post-punk" instead of describing what makes it post-punk.
**Why it fails:** Genre labels are contested categories, not techniques. AI systems need concrete instructions, not genre negotiations.
**Fix:** Treat genre labels as starting points requiring unpacking. What rhythmic, harmonic, and production choices define this genre for this artist?

### 4. The Representative Track Trap
**Pattern:** Analyzing one famous song and extrapolating to entire catalog. Missing range and evolution.
**Why it fails:** Artists vary. Their most famous song may not be representative. Analysis from one track produces narrow profiles.
**Fix:** Analyze 3-5 tracks from different periods and modes. Look for both constants and variations.

### 5. The Technical Overdose
**Pattern:** Including so much technical detail that prompts become unusable. Every possible parameter specified.
**Why it fails:** AI generation systems can't process unlimited context. Overly detailed prompts get truncated or confuse the model.
**Fix:** Distill to 5-10 essential phrases. Prioritize what makes this artist distinct rather than comprehensive.
