# Legal Audit Summary

Distill audit findings into a prioritized compliance roadmap with risk-scored findings, remediation actions, and governance follow-up.

## Prerequisites

1. Complete audit materials: reports, checklists, evidence, interviews, exhibits.
2. Jurisdictional scope and governing authorities per audit domain.
3. Applicable statutes, regulations, standards, or guidance.
4. Organizational context: business units, systems, and processes in scope.
5. Point of contact for ownership and timeline validation.

## Output Structure / Process

1. Intake and scope confirmation.
2. Executive Overview.
3. Findings Summary (aggregated).
4. Detailed Findings (per issue).
5. Remediation Roadmap.
6. Governance and Follow-Up.
7. Appendix (sources, assumptions, limitations).

**Executive Overview Template**

```text
Overall Compliance Posture: {concise assessment}
Total Findings: Critical {#} | High {#} | Medium {#} | Low {#}
Top Risk Areas: {domain 1}, {domain 2}, {domain 3}
Immediate Actions (0–60 days): {1–3 items}
Near-Term Actions (61–180 days): {1–3 items}
Long-Term Actions (181+ days): {1–3 items}
```

**Findings Summary Table**

| ID | Domain | Requirement | Deficiency | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Consequence | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-01 | {Domain} | {Citation} | {Gap} | {C/H/M/L} | {H/M/L} | {H/M/L} | {Penalty/License/Reputation} | {Dept} |

**Risk Rating Criteria**

| Rating | Criteria |
|---|---|
| Critical | Criminal exposure, license loss, business continuity threat, severe penalties |
| High | Material civil penalties, regulatory sanctions, major reputational harm |
| Medium | Noticeable compliance gap with moderate enforcement or cost exposure |
| Low | Minor gap, low enforcement likelihood, limited impact |

**Detailed Finding Template**

```text
Finding ID: F-##
Domain: {e.g., Data Privacy}
Requirement: {Statute/Regulation/Guidance + citation}
Issue: {What is missing or deficient}
Facts/Evidence: {Key facts supporting gap}
Risk Assessment:
  Likelihood: {H/M/L} | Impact: {H/M/L}
  Rationale: {brief, evidence-based}
Consequences: {Regulatory, civil, operational, reputational}
Recommendation:
  Action: {specific corrective action}
  Timeline: {date or days}
  Owner: {department/role}
  Resources: {budget, tools, external counsel, vendors}
```

**Financial Exposure**

- Provide ranges when exact penalties are unknown.
- Cite penalty provisions; use `[VERIFY]` where uncertain.
- Separate direct costs (fines, sanctions) from indirect costs (monitoring, remediation, litigation).

**Remediation Roadmap**

| Workstream | Actions | Priority | Dependencies | Timeline | Owner | Status Metric |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {Domain} | {Action list} | {C/H/M/L} | {Upstream items} | {dates} | {Dept} | {KPI} |

**Governance and Follow-Up**

- Recommend compliance task force with reporting cadence.
- Include audit re-check schedule and validation approach.

**Privilege Legend (if applicable)**

## Guidelines

- Use objective, non-admissions language; describe gaps as risks or deficiencies.
- Prioritize by risk; list Critical and High first.
- Keep citations accurate; add `[VERIFY]` for any uncertain authority.
- Provide concrete actions with owners and timelines, not generic recommendations.
- State interpretive uncertainty and propose mitigation steps.
- Avoid legal jargon; keep executive readability high.
- Ensure scope and limitations are explicit in the Appendix.
