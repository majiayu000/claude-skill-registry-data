# Offer Testing Playbooks Skill

## When to Use
- Planning subject line/CTA/offer tests across email, ads, or landing pages.
- Validating new positioning or pricing language.
- Running copy refresh cycles for campaigns.

## Framework
1. **Hypothesis** – statement of expected lift + rationale.
2. **Variable Selection** – hook, CTA, body copy, offer framing, proof element.
3. **Segmentation** – define audience splits and holdouts.
4. **Metrics** – primary KPI + guardrails (opens, CTR, CVR, CPL, unsub, spam).
5. **Analysis** – statistical significance (chi-square, z-test) or Bayesian approach.

## Templates
- Experiment brief (variable, control, variant, KPI, sample size, duration).
- Results report (metric table, significance, insight, next steps).
- Prioritization matrix (ICE/RICE scoring).

## Tips
- Limit to one variable per test to isolate learnings.
- Ensure minimum sample sizes per channel before declaring winners.
- Log tests and learnings in a shared repository.
