## Who is the DI?

DI types approach people and situations in an energetic, lively manner. They communicate clearly and vividly using an emotionally expressive style, combining the drive of D types with the social energy of I types. They eagerly take charge of social situations and use charisma to build rapport and share ideas. What sets them apart is their ability to combine bold action with genuine social warmth -- they don't just want to lead, they want to energize and excite people along the way.

## Do's

- Match their energy and enthusiasm. They respond to people who can keep up with their pace and passion.
- Stay objective but engaging. Come prepared with your own clear position -- they are naturally persuasive.
- Focus on the big picture and key decisions, not granular details.
- Be direct and brief. They appreciate people who get to the point quickly.
- Welcome their feedback and constructive criticism openly -- they respect that in others too.
- Take time to build a personal connection. They value relationships alongside results.
- Support their bold ideas with practical pathways to execution.
- Be ready for dynamic, spontaneous conversations rather than rigid agendas.

## Don'ts

- Don't present lengthy, detailed analyses or step-by-step instructions. They'll tune out.
- Don't be overly cautious or risk-averse in your recommendations. They respect boldness.
- Don't try to force structured daily agendas or rigid processes on them.
- Don't compete for control in social situations -- let them lead when it's their strength.
- Don't deliver bad news insensitively, but don't over-soften it either. Be straightforward.
- Don't expect them to research every previous approach before acting. They prefer to move forward.
- Don't minimize their ideas or dismiss them without hearing them out fully.
- Don't require them to communicate every decision aspect in exhaustive detail.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Keep meetings short and spontaneous without rigid agendas. DI types prefer dynamic discussions over formal presentations. Focus on decisions and action items, and let conversations flow naturally while staying on topic. Their best contributions come from energetic exchanges, not structured Q&A.

### Email
Be concise and include only critical information. Lead with your main point or request. DI types will skim long emails, so keep it brief and make action items clear. Skip lengthy context unless it is absolutely essential for the decision at hand.

### Giving Feedback
Make feedback specific and focused on the most critical points. DI types can handle direct criticism but will tune out lengthy feedback sessions. Prioritize what matters most and deliver it clearly. Frame feedback as an opportunity to win bigger rather than a correction.

### Resolving Conflict
Use conflict as an opportunity to discover better solutions. DI types prefer addressing issues directly with proposed fixes rather than dwelling on problems. Come prepared with ideas for resolution and frame the conversation as collaborative problem-solving.
