# Fault-Tolerant UI Graphs (React 18)

## Summary

Design UI graphs that remain resilient to partial failures and unstable dependencies.

## Key Capabilities

- Define containment zones using error boundaries.
- Implement fallback routing for failed graph nodes.
- Maintain functional paths for critical actions.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Prove fault containment across graph partitions.
- Analyze cascading failure probabilities.
- Optimize redundancy strategies for critical UI nodes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Demonstrate no total UI failure from isolated errors.
- Provide fault injection tests and results.
- Document redundancy design choices.
