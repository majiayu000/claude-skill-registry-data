## What I do

- Guide you through creating a new OpenCode agent by prompting for required configuration
- Generate agent files in either JSON (opencode.json) or Markdown format following official documentation
- Determine appropriate mode (primary or subagent) based on agent purpose
- Configure tools, permissions, temperature, maxSteps, and other agent options
- Create markdown agent files with proper frontmatter in `.opencode/agents/` or `~/.config/opencode/agents/`
- Ensure description is provided and other required fields are set correctly

## When to use me

Use this when:
- You want to create a new OpenCode agent without manually formatting configuration
- You need to ensure your agent follows official documentation standards
- You want to avoid repetitive setup when creating multiple agents

Ask clarifying questions about the agent's purpose, mode, tools access, and permissions.
