# Task Splitting

## Instructions

Split specified task into 2-3 subtasks. Each subtask must:

- Be independently completable and testable
- Deliver complete functionality that can be verified (avoid partial implementations that are untestable)
- Focus on functionality and requirements (not code details)

Update `docs/Implementation Plan.md` with the new subtask structure. Keep concise—avoid redundancy to reduce AI context usage.
