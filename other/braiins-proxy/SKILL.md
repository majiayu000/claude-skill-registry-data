# Braiins Farm Proxy

Skill for Braiins Farm Proxy - a high-performance mining proxy supporting both Stratum V1 and Stratum V2 protocols for aggregating hashrate from mining devices and providing failover protection.

## Description

Braiins Farm Proxy (formerly "Farm Proxy") is a specialized proxy server designed for Bitcoin mining operations that:

- **Protocol Support** - Handles both Stratum V1 and Stratum V2 connections
- **Hashrate Aggregation** - Combines hashrate from multiple miners into single upstream connection
- **Failover Protection** - Automatic pool switching when primary pool fails
- **Performance Optimization** - Reduces bandwidth and improves connection stability
- **Large-Scale Operations** - Designed for farms with hundreds or thousands of devices
- **Stratum V2 Benefits** - Enhanced security, job negotiation, and efficiency

- [GitHub: braiins-os (proxy component)](https://github.com/braiins/braiins-os)

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- **Aggregate hashrate** from multiple miners to reduce pool connections
- **Implement failover** with automatic pool switching for uptime
- **Optimize bandwidth** by reducing number of upstream pool connections
- **Deploy Stratum V2** across mining operations for enhanced security
- **Manage large farms** with hundreds or thousands of mining devices
- **Reduce latency** with local proxy closer to miners than remote pool
- **Centralize monitoring** of all miner connections through single proxy

## Quick Reference

### Key Features
- **Dual Protocol**: Stratum V1 and V2 support
- **Aggregation**: Multiple miners → single upstream connection
- **Failover**: Automatic pool switching on connection loss
- **Configuration**: TOML-based config files
- **Monitoring**: Metrics and logging for operational visibility
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment option

### Typical Deployment
```
Miners (1000s) → Farm Proxy → Mining Pool
  ↓ Stratum V1/V2   ↓ Aggregated    ↓ Single connection
                    ↓ Failover ready
```

### Use Cases
1. **Large Mining Farms**: Aggregate 100+ miners to single pool connection
2. **Failover Protection**: Switch between primary/backup pools automatically
3. **Bandwidth Optimization**: Reduce internet bandwidth usage
4. **Stratum V2 Migration**: Transition farms from V1 to V2 protocol
5. **Latency Reduction**: Local proxy reduces round-trip time to miners
