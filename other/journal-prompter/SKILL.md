# Journal Prompter

The Journal Prompter skill provides thoughtful, targeted journaling prompts designed to foster self-awareness, clarity, and personal growth. Rather than generic "How was your day?" questions, this skill offers research-backed prompts that surface insights, identify patterns, and support intentional development.

This skill draws from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), positive psychology, stoic philosophy, and executive coaching methodologies to create prompts that are both therapeutic and action-oriented. The prompts adapt to your context—celebrating wins, processing setbacks, clarifying decisions, and uncovering blindspots.

The journaling frameworks range from quick daily check-ins to deep weekly reviews, making it easy to maintain a sustainable practice that fits your schedule and needs.

## Best Practices

- **Write by hand when possible** - Deeper processing and retention
- **Don't edit yourself** - Let thoughts flow without judgment
- **Be specific** - "I felt frustrated when..." not "I felt bad"
- **Focus on quality, not quantity** - 5 thoughtful minutes > 30 rushed minutes
- **Write for yourself only** - Radical honesty requires privacy
- **Date every entry** - Track patterns over time
- **Review periodically** - Read past entries quarterly
- **Experiment with prompts** - Different questions unlock different insights
- **Journal at consistent times** - Build the habit
- **Use prompts as starting points** - Let writing go where it needs to
- **Celebrate progress** - Notice growth over time
- **Be honest about negatives** - But also capture positives
- **Ask "why" multiple times** - Dig beneath surface answers
- **Notice what you avoid writing** - Resistance signals importance
- **Revisit decisions** - What would you decide now? Why?

## Journaling Myths vs. Reality

**Myth**: Journaling requires 30+ minutes daily
**Reality**: 5 focused minutes with a good prompt is highly effective

**Myth**: You need to write pages and pages
**Reality**: Bullet points and brief responses work great

**Myth**: Journaling is only for processing negative emotions
**Reality**: Equally valuable for celebrating wins and exploring ideas

**Myth**: You have to journal every single day
**Reality**: Consistency matters more than perfection—3x/week is solid

**Myth**: There's a "right" way to journal
**Reality**: The best method is the one you'll actually use

## Integration Points

This skill works well with:
- **Daily Planner**: Reflect on how plans vs. reality compared
- **Goal Setter**: Process goal progress and obstacles
- **Habit Tracker**: Identify patterns in habit consistency
- **Decision Helper**: Think through important choices
- **Learning Path Creator**: Reflect on learning progress

## Example Journaling Session

**User**: "journal prompt"

**Skill Response**:
"Let's create space for reflection. I have a few options depending on what you need:

**Quick Prompts** (5 minutes):
- Morning intention setting
- Evening highlight capture
- Gratitude practice

**Deeper Reflection** (15-20 minutes):
- Weekly review
- Emotion processing
- Decision clarity
- Themed exploration (relationships, career, growth, etc.)

What feels right for you right now?"

**User**: "evening reflection"

**Skill Response**:
"Perfect. Let's reflect on your day before you close it out.

Take a breath, and then respond to these prompts in whatever way feels natural—bullets, paragraphs, stream of consciousness, whatever works.

**1. What was the best moment of your day?**
Could be big or small—a conversation, an accomplishment, a moment of peace, anything that stands out positively.

Take your time. I'll wait."

**User**: "Had a great conversation with Sarah about the new project. She really got what I was trying to do."

**Skill Response**:
"That sense of being understood is powerful. Connection and validation.

**2. What challenged you today?**
What felt difficult, frustrating, or draining? What took more energy than expected?"

*[Continues through evening reflection prompts, adapting follow-up questions based on responses]*

**Final Prompt**:
"Last one:

**What's ONE thing you want to focus on tomorrow?**
Not your whole to-do list—just one thing that would make tomorrow feel meaningful or successful."

*[Closes with acknowledgment and encouragement for the practice]*
