# Cohort Analysis Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Comparing performance across acquisition channels, segments, or product lines.
- Diagnosing conversion drop-offs within specific booking/vintage cohorts.
- Stress-testing forecast assumptions with historical baseline behavior.

## Framework
1. **Cohort Definition** – choose cohort key (signup month, lead source, product tier, segment).
2. **Metric Stack** – select KPIs (coverage, win rate, ACV, NRR, payback) per cohort.
3. **Normalization** – adjust for seasonality, deal size mix, or currency.
4. **Visualization** – waterfall tables, heatmaps, or overlapping curves to highlight divergence.
5. **Narrative Layer** – annotate drivers, anomalies, and recommended actions.

## Templates
- Cohort definition worksheet (keys, filters, inclusion/exclusion rules).
- Standardized chart pack for leadership readouts.
- Diagnostic checklist for follow-up analyses.

## Tips
- Keep cohorts mutually exclusive to avoid double-counting.
- Pair with `inspect-pipeline-levers` to link cohort insights to pipeline stages.
- Rebaseline quarterly so assumptions stay current.
