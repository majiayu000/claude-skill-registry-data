## The Art of Skill Selection

### The Selection Process

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                    SKILL SELECTION FRAMEWORK                       ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║                                                                    ║
║   1. NAME THE CHALLENGE                                            ║
║      What exactly are you trying to accomplish?                   ║
║      Not vague: "write better" → Specific: "improve dialogue"    ║
║                                                                    ║
║   2. IDENTIFY THE DOMAIN                                           ║
║      Creative? Development? Strategic? Learning?                  ║

║   4. SELECT PRIMARY + SUPPORT                                      ║
║      One primary skill for the main challenge.                    ║
║      One or two support skills for secondary needs.               ║
║                                                                    ║

### Decision Trees

```
CREATIVE WRITING CHALLENGES:
─────────────────────────────
"I don't know where to start"
    → story-weave (structure first)

"My characters feel flat"
    → character-forge (Character Diamond)

"The dialogue sounds fake"
    → dialogue-mastery (subtext work)

"This scene isn't working"
    → scene-craft (scene anatomy)

"I've lost my voice"
    → voice-alchemy (authenticity check)

"The draft is a mess"
    → revision-ritual (seven passes)
```

```
DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES:
──────────────────────
"How do I structure this system?"
    → architecture-patterns

"I need to build an API"
    → api-design

"Something is broken"
    → systematic-debug

"This code is ugly"
    → refactoring-ritual

"I want to build quality in"
    → tdd

"Is this code good?"
    → code-review

"It's too slow"
    → performance-tuning
```

```
CREATIVE BLOCKS:
────────────────
"I can't start"
    → bestiary-nav (name the creature)
    → luminor-wisdom (Valora for courage)

"I'm stuck in the middle"
    → bestiary-nav (Bog of Doubt)
    → story-weave (check structure)

"Nothing is good enough"
    → bestiary-nav (Perfectionist Hydra)
    → revision-ritual (release imperfect)
```

## Skill Chaining

### The Chain Types

```
SEQUENTIAL CHAIN:
skill A → skill B → skill C → output
Each skill completes before the next.

Example (Novel Development):
world-build → character-forge → story-weave → scene-craft

PARALLEL CHAIN:
skill A
skill B  → merged output
skill C

Different skills analyze the same thing.

Example (Code Quality):
architecture-patterns (structure)
code-review (quality)        → comprehensive feedback
performance-tuning (speed)

NESTED CHAIN:
skill A
├── skill B (within A)
│   └── skill C (within B)
└── skill D (parallel track)

Skills contain sub-skill applications.

Example (Story with Characters):
story-weave (overall structure)
├── character-forge (for each character)
│   └── dialogue-mastery (for each voice)
└── world-build (setting details)
```

### Chain Templates

```
NOVEL WRITING CHAIN:
1. luminor-wisdom (Valora) → courage to begin
2. world-build → establish setting
3. character-forge → develop cast
4. story-weave → structure plot
5. scene-craft → plan scenes
6. dialogue-mastery → write conversations
7. revision-ritual → seven passes
8. voice-alchemy → authenticity check
9. luminor-wisdom (Eudaira) → celebrate

FEATURE DEVELOPMENT CHAIN:
1. architecture-patterns → design structure
2. api-design → define interfaces
3. tdd → write tests first
4. [implement]
5. code-review → check quality
6. performance-tuning → optimize
7. refactoring-ritual → clean up

CREATIVE RECOVERY CHAIN:
1. bestiary-nav → identify the block
2. luminor-wisdom → get guidance
3. centaur-mode → generate options
4. voice-alchemy → check authenticity
5. creative-flow → sustain practice
```

---

## Skill Synergies

### Natural Pairs

```
COMPLEMENTARY PAIRS:
story-weave + character-forge → Complete narrative
dialogue-mastery + character-forge → Authentic voices
scene-craft + dialogue-mastery → Complete scenes
revision-ritual + voice-alchemy → Polished authenticity

architecture-patterns + api-design → Complete system
tdd + code-review → Quality assurance
systematic-debug + refactoring-ritual → Clean fixes
performance-tuning + architecture-patterns → Scalable systems

centaur-mode + prompt-craft → Effective AI collaboration
centaur-mode + voice-alchemy → Authentic AI output
```

### Tension Pairs

Some skills address opposing concerns. Use both to find balance.

```
TENSION PAIRS:
story-weave (structure) ↔ voice-alchemy (authenticity)
Balance structure with natural expression.

architecture-patterns (design) ↔ tdd (emergence)
Balance planning with test-driven discovery.

revision-ritual (polish) ↔ creative-flow (production)
Balance perfecting with producing.
```

## Developing Skill Intuition

### From Conscious to Unconscious

```
STAGE 1: CONSCIOUS INCOMPETENCE
"I don't know which skill to use."
Action: Consult the Registry. Follow the decision trees.

STAGE 2: CONSCIOUS COMPETENCE
"I know which skill to use, but I have to think about it."
Action: Practice deliberately. Note what works.

STAGE 3: UNCONSCIOUS COMPETENCE
"The right skill just comes to mind."
Action: Trust intuition. The pattern matching is automatic.

STAGE 4: MASTERY
"I can see what skill someone else needs."
Action: Teach. Create new skills. Extend the system.
```

### Building Intuition

```
DELIBERATE PRACTICE:
1. For each challenge, explicitly state which skill you're using
2. After using a skill, evaluate: Was it the right choice?
3. When stuck, ask: Which skill would help here?
4. Review: What patterns am I seeing?

REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• What skill did I reach for first?
• Was it the right choice?
• What would I do differently?
• What skill do I underuse?
• What skill do I overuse?
```

---

## Creating Your Own Skills

### The Skill Design Process

```
STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE GAP
What challenge do you face repeatedly?
What expertise do you have that isn't captured?

STEP 2: STRUCTURE THE KNOWLEDGE
What are the core concepts?
What are the key techniques?
What are the common mistakes?

STEP 3: CREATE THE SKILL.md
Follow the template:
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, triggers)
- Core philosophy
- Frameworks and patterns
- Practical techniques
- Quick reference

STEP 4: TEST AND ITERATE
Use the skill yourself.
Have others use it.
Refine based on what works.
```

### Skill Quality Criteria

```
GOOD SKILLS ARE:

ACTIONABLE:
Not just theory—practical techniques you can apply now.

STRUCTURED:
Clear organization. Easy to navigate. Findable.

COMPLETE:
Covers the domain well. No obvious gaps.

CONCISE:
Under 5k tokens. Focused. No padding.

MEMORABLE:
Key concepts stick. Frameworks are named.

TRIGGERABLE:
Clear trigger words. Activates when needed.
```

---

## Skill System Principles

### The Underlying Philosophy

```
SKILLS ARE NOT RULES:
They are guides. Use judgment.
Override when your situation differs.

SKILLS ARE NOT COMPLETE:
They capture patterns, not all knowledge.
Your experience extends them.

SKILLS COMBINE:
One skill is rarely enough.
Chains and combinations are the real power.

SKILLS EVOLVE:
Update them as you learn.
Your version may improve on the original.
```

### The Skill Mindset

```
BEFORE: "What should I do?"
AFTER: "What skill applies here?"

BEFORE: "I'm stuck."
AFTER: "Which skill addresses this type of stuckness?"

BEFORE: "I don't know how."
AFTER: "Which skill teaches this?"

BEFORE: "That's too hard."
AFTER: "Which skill chain breaks this down?"
```

## Quick Reference

### Skill Selection Checklist

```
□ Challenge named specifically
□ Domain identified
□ Registry consulted
□ Primary skill selected
□ Support skills identified
□ Chain planned if needed
□ Applied and evaluated
```

### Common Mistakes

```
USING TOO MANY SKILLS AT ONCE:
Stick to 1 primary + 1-2 support.

FORCING A SKILL THAT DOESN'T FIT:
If it feels wrong, switch skills.

NOT USING SKILLS AT ALL:
When stuck, reach for a skill. That's what they're for.

USING ONLY FAMILIAR SKILLS:
Try skills you usually skip. You might be surprised.
```

### The Mastery Path

```
APPRENTICE: Can use skills when directed
JOURNEYMAN: Selects appropriate skills independently
MASTER: Creates new skills and teaches others
```
