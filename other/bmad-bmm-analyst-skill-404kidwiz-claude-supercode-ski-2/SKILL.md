## Anti-Patterns

### Analysis Anti-Patterns

- **Analysis Paralysis**: Over-researching without making decisions - set clear research boundaries and decision deadlines
- **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking only data that supports existing hypotheses - actively seek contradictory evidence
- **Scope Creep**: Allowing research scope to expand endlessly - use MoSCoW prioritization and say no to scope expansion
- **Vanity Metrics**: Focusing on impressive-looking numbers that don't drive decisions - prioritize actionable metrics

### Stakeholder Anti-Patterns

- **Hello World Stakeholders**: Engaging every stakeholder equally - identify key decision-makers and prioritize their needs
- **Analysis Theater**: Creating impressive reports that no one uses - validate deliverable usefulness with stakeholders
- **Expertise Overload**: Using jargon that alienates stakeholders - adapt communication to audience technical level
- **Consensus Addiction**: Waiting for 100% stakeholder agreement - establish decision-making thresholds

### Requirements Anti-Patterns

- **Gold Plating**: Adding features beyond stated requirements - deliver exactly what's needed, propose enhancements separately
- **Requirements Telepathy**: Assuming stakeholders will say what they need - use iterative elicitation and prototypes
- **Pet Features**: Advocating for personal favorite features - let data and stakeholder priorities drive recommendations
- **Swiss Cheese Scope**: Accepting requirements with intentional gaps - ensure requirements are complete and unambiguous

### Process Anti-Patterns

- **Waterfall in Agile Clothing**: Following sequential phases while calling it agile - embrace iterative delivery
- **Meeting as a Sport**: Scheduling excessive meetings without clear outcomes - have agendas, outcomes, and time limits
- **Documentation Without Action**: Creating comprehensive docs that don't drive decisions - tie analysis to action items
- **Perfection as Excuse**: Using "more analysis needed" to avoid committing to recommendations

## Examples

### Example 1: Fintech App Market Entry Analysis

**Scenario:** A financial technology startup wants to build a micro-investment app for Gen Z users in the US market.

**Analysis Approach:**
1. **Market Research**: Analyzed target demographic (18-24 year olds), investment behaviors, and competitor apps (Acorns, Stash, Robinhood)
2. **User Research**: Conducted 30 interviews with potential users to understand pain points
3. **Competitive Analysis**: Mapped feature sets, pricing models, and user experience gaps
4. **Business Case Development**: Created financial projections with three scenarios (conservative, base, optimistic)

**Key Findings:**
- Gen Z wants social investing features (copy trading, leaderboards)
- Competitors lack gamification and financial education integration
- Average willing to pay: $3-7/month for premium features
- Regulatory complexity is moderate (SEC regulations apply)

**Deliverables:**
- Product brief with prioritized feature roadmap
- Competitive positioning matrix
- Go-to-market strategy with influencer partnerships
- Financial model with 3-year projections

### Example 2: Enterprise Software Feature Prioritization

**Scenario:** A B2B SaaS company with limited engineering capacity needs to prioritize which features to build in the next quarter.

**Requirements Discovery Process:**
1. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Interviewed 15 enterprise customers and internal sales team
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyzed feature requests, support tickets, and usage analytics
3. **Value Mapping**: Scored features by revenue impact, customer count, and strategic fit
4. **Workshop Facilitation**: Led prioritization workshop with product and engineering leadership

**Prioritization Framework Applied:**
| Feature | Revenue Impact | Customer Count | Effort | Priority Score |
|---------|---------------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| SSO Integration | High | 45 | Medium | 87 |
| API Access | High | 62 | High | 82 |
| Custom Reports | Medium | 38 | Low | 75 |
| Mobile App | Medium | 71 | Very High | 68 |

**Recommendations:**
- Phase 1: SSO Integration and Custom Reports (highest ROI)
- Phase 2: API Access (deferred due to effort)
- Phase 3: Mobile App (future roadmap)

### Example 3: Healthcare Process Optimization

**Scenario:** A regional hospital network wants to reduce patient wait times in their emergency department by 25%.

**Process Analysis:**
1. **Current State Mapping**: Documented patient journey from arrival to discharge
2. **Data Collection**: Analyzed 10,000 patient records and time-stamped events
3. **Bottleneck Identification**: Used process mining to identify waiting points
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Conducted interviews with clinical staff

**Key Bottlenecks Found:**
- Registration process averages 12 minutes (should be 4)
- Lab results waiting average 45 minutes (parallel processing possible)
- Physician availability peaks at wrong times (scheduling misalignment)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement mobile pre-registration (reduce registration to 4 minutes)
- Parallel lab processing workflow (reduce wait by 20 minutes)
- Dynamic physician scheduling based on historical demand

**Projected Impact:**
- 28% reduction in average wait time
- 15% improvement in patient satisfaction scores
- $1.2M annual operational savings
