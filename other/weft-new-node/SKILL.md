description: "COMMAND, not reference: Expert entry: have a specific node built, or take the hand and write it yourself. Run this when the user asks for this step by name, optionally naming what the node should do, in plain words. The seventeen `weft-` reference skills beside it are things you read; this is a procedure you carry out."

This is the expert path for a node the user wants built by name. The capability is whatever the user described when they asked, in plain words. (In normal work you never need this command: missing nodes are dispatched by [the loop] itself.)

1. Read the `weft-catalog` and `weft-node-authoring` skills if you have not this session.
2. Verify the gap: `weft describe-nodes --list`, then `weft describe-nodes --node <Type> --compact` on anything close. If something fits, say so and stop; a custom node is the last resort.
3. Ask the user one question: do they want to write it themselves, or have it dispatched?
   - **Dispatch**: design the typed contract (one job, exact ports with types, and `accepts` only where a wire would be a mistake), then dispatch a `node-smith` with [the brief], run [the review] on the report against the checklist, redispatch on failure, and report the landed node.
   - **Hand**: the user writes the node; you are the support. Open the manual with them, scaffold the node's folder (beside the module that uses it under `src/`, or under `nodes/` when shared) with the metadata skeleton from the contract, and stay out of the file they are writing unless asked. They say when to run `weft test-node <type>`.
4. Report, in plain words: the type name, its ports, where it landed, the test state.
