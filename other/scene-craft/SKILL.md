## What Is a Scene?

A scene is a unit of story that occurs in:
- One location (or continuous movement)
- One time period (or continuous time)
- With change happening

**If nothing changes, it's not a scene—it's a description.**

## The Scene Types

### Action Scenes (Proactive)
```
GOAL → CONFLICT → DISASTER

The character wants something,
tries to get it,
and fails (or succeeds at a cost).

Example:
GOAL: Detective needs suspect to confess
CONFLICT: Suspect is clever, has alibi
DISASTER: Suspect reveals knowledge only killer would have—
          but has ironclad alibi
```

### Reaction Scenes (Reactive)
```
REACTION → DILEMMA → DECISION

The character processes what happened,
faces impossible choice,
and commits to new action.

Example:
REACTION: Detective reels from revelation
DILEMMA: Pursue impossible lead or accept defeat?
DECISION: There must be an accomplice—find them
```

### The Alternating Pattern
```
ACTION → REACTION → ACTION → REACTION

Scenes breathe: tension, release, tension, release
Action builds pressure, reaction gives space to feel
```

## Scene Anatomy

### The Opening

**First Line Goals:**
- Hook attention
- Establish POV
- Ground in time/place
- Create question

**Opening Techniques:**

**1. In Medias Res**
```
Start in the middle of action.

"The knife was already at her throat when she recognized him."

No warm-up. Immediate engagement.
```

**2. Contrast**
```
Start with opposite of what's coming.

"It was the happiest morning of her life."

Reader knows something bad is coming.
Dramatic irony creates tension.
```

**3. Question**
```
Open with mystery.

"No one could explain why the clock stopped at 3:33."

Reader needs to know. Pulls them forward.
```

**4. Voice**
```
Lead with distinctive character voice.

"Let me tell you something about stealing a god's chariot."

Voice is the hook. We want to hear more.
```

**5. Sensory**
```
Immerse in physical world.

"The smell hit her first—copper and burning sage."

Body grounds reader in scene.
```

### The Middle

**Building Tension:**
```
ESCALATE: Each beat raises stakes
COMPLICATE: Add new obstacles
REVEAL: New information changes situation
SURPRISE: Subvert expectations
DEEPEN: Emotional intensity increases
```

**The Scene's Heart:**
```
Every scene needs a PIVOT POINT—
the moment when everything shifts.

Before the pivot: one state
After the pivot: changed state

Find your pivot. Build toward it.
```

**Pacing the Middle:**
```
SHORT BEATS: Faster pace, tension
   Dialogue snaps back and forth
   Short paragraphs
   Quick actions

LONG BEATS: Slower pace, weight
   Deeper internal thought
   Sensory description
   Emotional processing
```

### The Ending

**Last Line Goals:**
- Propel to next scene
- Create question or hook
- Land emotional beat
- Change established

**Ending Techniques:**

**1. Cliffhanger**
```
Interrupt at peak tension.

"She opened the door—and screamed."

Reader MUST continue.
```

**2. Revelation**
```
Drop new information.

"That's when she saw the photograph.
It was her mother. Twenty years ago.
Standing next to the man she'd just killed."

Changes everything. Demands continuation.
```

**3. Decision**
```
Character commits to action.

"She knew what she had to do.
God help her, she knew."

Signals change, creates anticipation.
```

**4. Emotion**
```
Land on powerful feeling.

"For the first time in eleven years, she cried."

Resonance. Reader feels with character.
```

**5. Irony**
```
Twist meaning of what came before.

"He finally understood why she'd been laughing."

Recontextualizes. Haunts forward.
```

## Scene Construction Process

### Step 1: Define the Change
```
Before writing, answer:
- What is the state at scene start?
- What is the state at scene end?
- What is the CHANGE?

No clear change = no scene yet.
```

### Step 2: Identify the Goal
```
What does the POV character want?
- Must be specific
- Must be active (they're trying to get it)
- Must matter

Vague goal = weak scene.
```

### Step 3: Design the Obstacle
```
What prevents them from getting it?
- External (other characters, circumstances)
- Internal (fear, doubt, moral conflict)
- Or both (best scenes have both)

Easy victory = boring scene.
```

### Step 4: Find the Pivot
```
What moment changes everything?
- Revelation
- Decision
- Action
- Failure/success

Build toward the pivot. Everything leads there.
```

### Step 5: Choose Your Ending
```
How do you propel the reader forward?
- Cliffhanger
- Revelation
- Decision
- Emotion
- Irony

Weak endings = reader puts book down.
```

## Scene Pacing

### Controlling Time

**Scene Time vs. Story Time:**
```
SUMMARY: Hours in a sentence
"The next three days blurred together."

SCENE: Real-time dramatization
"He knocked. Waited. Knocked again."

STRETCH: Slowing below real-time
"The bullet left the chamber. Time stopped.
She saw the brass casing glint in the light.
Saw the puff of smoke. Saw the trajectory—"
```

**When to Use Each:**
```
SUMMARY: Unimportant transitions
SCENE: Important events
STRETCH: Critical moments of high stakes
```

### Sentence Length as Pace

```
SHORT SENTENCES MOVE FAST.
He ran. The door was locked.
He shouldered it. Once. Twice.
It gave.

Longer sentences slow the pace down,
allow the reader to breathe, to absorb,
to feel the weight of the moment
as it unfolds with deliberate care.
```

### White Space

```
"I love you," she said.

He didn't answer.

White space creates pause.
Weight.
The reader's mind fills the silence.
```

## Scene Types by Purpose

### The Setup Scene
```
PURPOSE: Establish character, world, stakes
DANGER: Can feel slow
SOLUTION: Create immediate micro-conflict
even while setting up larger story

Example: Harry Potter's introduction—
even the "setup" has conflict (Dursleys vs. magic)
```

### The Confrontation Scene
```
PURPOSE: Characters clash
KEYS:
- Clear stakes for both sides
- Both believe they're right
- Escalation
- Real consequences

Example: Any courtroom drama cross-examination
```

### The Revelation Scene
```
PURPOSE: Major information revealed
KEYS:
- Build anticipation
- Revelation is earned
- Emotional impact shown
- Changes everything forward

Example: "Luke, I am your father"
```

### The Decision Scene
```
PURPOSE: Character commits to path
KEYS:
- Real choice (both options viable)
- Show internal struggle
- Decision reveals character
- Point of no return

Example: Character chooses to tell the truth
knowing it will destroy their career
```

### The Action Scene
```
PURPOSE: Physical conflict
KEYS:
- Clear spatial geography
- Cause and effect
- Stakes beyond survival
- Character revealed through action

Example: Any chase sequence
where we care about the runner
```

### The Intimate Scene
```
PURPOSE: Emotional connection
KEYS:
- Vulnerability
- Subtext
- Physical grounding
- Something changes between characters

Example: Two characters finally saying
what they've avoided for years
```

## Scene Troubleshooting

### Problem: Scene Feels Slow
```
DIAGNOSE: Where does momentum die?
SOLUTIONS:
- Cut the opening (start later)
- Add micro-conflicts
- Remove unnecessary description
- Increase stakes
- Cut the ending (end earlier)
```

### Problem: Scene Feels Rushed
```
DIAGNOSE: What moment needs more weight?
SOLUTIONS:
- Add sensory grounding
- Include internal reaction
- Slow at pivot point
- Let dialogue breathe
- Use white space
```

### Problem: Scene Feels Pointless
```
DIAGNOSE: What changes?
SOLUTIONS:
- Define the change first
- Cut if nothing changes
- Merge with another scene
- Add stakes
- Find the hidden conflict
```

### Problem: Scene Feels Predictable
```
DIAGNOSE: Where does reader know what's coming?
SOLUTIONS:
- Subvert expectations
- Add complication
- Change the outcome
- Shift point of view
- Find the surprise you're hiding
```
