# Backend Models

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend models.

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying Prisma schema files (schema.prisma)
- When defining TypeORM entities or Drizzle schema definitions
- When writing Mongoose schemas or Sequelize models
- When implementing database table structures with columns and data types
- When defining relationships between models (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- When adding database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, foreign keys)
- When creating indexes on model fields for query performance
- When implementing model-level validation rules or business logic
- When defining cascade behaviors for related data (CASCADE, SET NULL, RESTRICT)
- When setting up timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) or soft delete functionality
