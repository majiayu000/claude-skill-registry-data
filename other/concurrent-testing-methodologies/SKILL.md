# Concurrent Testing Methodologies (React 18)

## Summary

Develop rigorous testing methodologies that capture concurrency-related defects and regressions.

## Key Capabilities

- Build deterministic concurrency test harnesses.
- Use randomized scheduling to surface hidden defects.
- Validate rendering invariants under stress.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Prove coverage of concurrency hazard classes.
- Design stochastic tests with reproducible seeds.
- Analyze failure clustering to improve test design.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Provide a concurrency-focused test suite.
- Demonstrate detection of a subtle concurrency bug.
- Document test methodology and coverage rationale.
