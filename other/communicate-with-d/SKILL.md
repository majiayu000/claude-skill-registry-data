## Who is the D?

D types are assertive, intense, and ambitious. They are pragmatic, results-oriented executors who work quickly and make decisions with firmness and objectivity. They see obstacles as challenges to overcome rather than reasons to slow down, and they possess a natural authority that others recognize. You will always know where you stand with a D -- their directness is authentic and consistent.

## Do's

- Get to the point immediately. Lead with your bottom line, recommendation, or request.
- Come prepared with clear options and a recommended course of action.
- Be direct and confident. They respect people who can hold their ground in a discussion.
- Focus on facts, logic, and outcomes rather than emotions or relationships.
- Match their pace -- respond quickly, make decisions, and keep things moving.
- Give them autonomy and decision-making authority whenever possible.
- Keep meetings brief, with a clear agenda and defined decisions to be made.
- Use bullet points and concise language in written communication.

## Don'ts

- Don't bury your point in background context or lengthy preambles.
- Don't be wishy-washy or present ideas without confidence. They lose interest in uncertainty.
- Don't micromanage them or require excessive check-ins.
- Don't require consensus on every decision -- let them lead when appropriate.
- Don't make emotional appeals or focus heavily on how people feel about an issue.
- Don't schedule meetings that could have been emails.
- Don't expect frequent verbal encouragement or praise from them -- they show respect through trust and delegation.
- Don't slow things down with bureaucratic processes or unnecessary approvals.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Keep meetings brief, focused, and only scheduled when necessary. D types appreciate a clear agenda and dislike meetings that could have been emails. Get to the point quickly, make decisions, and end on time. If you need their input, come prepared with options rather than open-ended questions.

### Email
Keep emails short and businesslike. Lead with the key point or request, not background context. Use bullet points for multiple items and be explicit about what action you need from them. D types often skim emails, so put the most important information first.

### Giving Feedback
Give feedback directly and without excessive softening. D types appreciate honesty and can handle criticism that is delivered straightforwardly. Focus on key points rather than comprehensive lists, and frame feedback in terms of results and impact rather than feelings.

### Resolving Conflict
Address conflicts objectively and promptly -- D types don't like issues left to fester. Focus on facts rather than emotions and come prepared with potential solutions. They respect people who can stand their ground without becoming defensive or emotional.
