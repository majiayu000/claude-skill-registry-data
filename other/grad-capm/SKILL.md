# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

## Overview

CAPM (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965) establishes a linear relationship between systematic risk and expected return. The model states that the expected return on any asset equals the risk-free rate plus a premium for bearing market risk, scaled by the asset's beta.

## When to Use

- Estimating required rate of return for equity valuation
- Calculating cost of equity in WACC
- Comparing asset risk via beta
- Evaluating portfolio performance against the Security Market Line (SML)

## When NOT to Use

- When the asset has significant exposure to size, value, or other factors beyond market risk
- For illiquid or non-traded assets where beta estimation is unreliable
- When market portfolio proxy is questionable (Roll's critique)

## Assumptions

```
IRON LAW: CAPM only prices SYSTEMATIC risk — diversifiable (unsystematic)
risk earns NO premium. An asset's expected return depends solely on its
beta with the market portfolio.
```

Key assumptions:
1. Investors are mean-variance optimizers with homogeneous expectations
2. A risk-free asset exists for unlimited borrowing and lending
3. Markets are frictionless — no taxes, transaction costs, or short-selling constraints
4. All assets are infinitely divisible and publicly traded

## Methodology

### Step 1 — Identify Inputs

- Risk-free rate (Rf): government bond yield matching investment horizon
- Market return E(Rm): historical average or forward-looking estimate
- Beta: regression of asset returns against market returns

### Step 2 — Compute Expected Return

E(Ri) = Rf + Bi x (E(Rm) - Rf). See `references/derivation.md` for the derivation from mean-variance optimization.

### Step 3 — Plot on Security Market Line

Assets above the SML are undervalued (positive alpha); below are overvalued (negative alpha).

### Step 4 — Interpret and Decide

- Beta > 1: amplifies market moves, higher risk-higher expected return
- Beta < 1: dampens market moves, lower risk-lower expected return
- Beta = 0: returns equal the risk-free rate

## Output Format

> ⚠️ **Decimal vs percent**: When passing values to or from the bundled script, all rates
> (`risk_free`, `market_return`, `beta_contribution`, `expected_return`, `alpha`) are
> **decimals** — `0.05` means 5%, NOT `5.0`. The narrative report below renders them as
> percentages for humans, but never mix the two in the same JSON object.

## CAPM Analysis: [Asset / Portfolio]

### Inputs
| Parameter | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Risk-free rate (Rf) | x% | [source] |
| Market return E(Rm) | x% | [source] |
| Beta | x.xx | [estimation method] |

### Expected Return
- E(Ri) = Rf + B x (E(Rm) - Rf) = x%

### SML Assessment
- Alpha = Actual return - Expected return = x%
- Interpretation: [undervalued / overvalued / fairly priced]

### Limitations in This Context
- [Note any assumption violations]
```

## Gotchas

- Beta is backward-looking; future beta may differ from historical estimates
- Choice of market proxy matters enormously (Roll's critique, 1977)
- CAPM assumes a single risk factor; empirical evidence supports multi-factor models
- Risk-free rate selection (T-bill vs T-bond) affects results significantly
- Beta estimation is sensitive to return frequency (daily vs monthly) and sample period
- CAPM fails to explain the low-beta anomaly (low-beta stocks outperform predictions)
