# Ralph Loop for Kiro Specs

An automated, iterative agent runner that drives spec-based development in [Kiro](https://kiro.dev). It wraps `kiro-cli` in a bash loop, feeding it a carefully engineered prompt that turns Kiro into a disciplined, self-correcting implementation agent — one that picks up tasks from a spec, implements them, verifies its own work, and learns from its mistakes across iterations.

## When to Use

- Automate implementation of Kiro spec tasks through repeated agent iterations
- Drive a spec from start to finish without manual prompt-by-prompt interaction
- Set up the Ralph Loop in a new project
- Troubleshoot a stuck or failed Ralph Loop run
- Understand how progress tracking, corrections, and codebase patterns work
- Generate or interpret the summary dashboard after completion

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Kiro CLI | `kiro-cli` must be installed and on `PATH` ([kiro.dev/cli](https://kiro.dev/cli/)) |
| Kiro IDE | [kiro.dev](https://kiro.dev/) installed |
| Bash | Standard bash shell |
| Kiro Specs | A project with specs under `.kiro/specs/<specs_name>/` containing at least `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` |

## How It Works

Ralph runs a loop where each iteration sends a prompt to `kiro-cli`. The prompt instructs the agent to follow a strict six-phase cycle:

### The Six Phases

1. **Load Context** — Read steering files (`product.md`, `structure.md`, `tech.md`) and the target spec (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `progress.md`). Take stock of available tools.
2. **Pick ONE Task** — Find the lowest-numbered incomplete top-level task. Record start time. Never pick more than one task per iteration.
3. **Understand Before Implementing** — Read relevant source files, study existing patterns, re-read the Corrections and Codebase Patterns sections from `progress.md`, and apply every relevant correction proactively.
4. **Implement** — Implement the task and all subtasks in order. Run typechecks and tests. If something fails: fix it, write a correction immediately if a future iteration could hit the same problem, and move on. After 5 failed attempts, mark the task `[F]` and log an unresolved blocker.
5. **Verify Exit Criteria** — Re-read exit criteria from `requirements.md` and design constraints from `design.md`. Confirm each is satisfied before marking complete.
6. **Update Tracking** — Mark the task `[X]` in `tasks.md`, append a progress entry to `progress.md`, add new codebase patterns, do a final correction sweep, and record timing to `specs_time.md`.

### The Self-Correction System

The Corrections section at the top of `progress.md` is a flat lookup table of mistakes and their fixes. Every iteration reads it before doing any work and must never repeat a listed mistake. Corrections are written immediately when errors happen — not at the end of the task.

Format:
```
- ❌ `python manage.py migrate` → ✅ `python3 manage.py migrate` (system has no `python` alias)
- ❌ Running tests with `npm test` → ✅ `npm run test:unit` (project uses separate test scripts)
- ❌ UNRESOLVED: [description of issue that couldn't be fixed after 5 attempts]
```

### Codebase Patterns

Ralph accumulates conventions discovered during implementation — file naming, import patterns, error handling, testing commands, etc. Only patterns actually encountered are recorded, not speculative ones.

### Completion and Summary Dashboard

When all tasks are marked `[X]`, Ralph generates a self-contained `summary.html` in the spec directory with:
- **Top pane**: spec name, status indicator (green/red), total elapsed time, task count, date range
- **Left pane**: collapsible task tree with hover tooltips showing progress details
- **Right pane**: timing table with per-task start/end times and durations

## Project Structure

The user's project should look like this before running Ralph:

```
your-project/
├── ralph-loop-kiro-specs-prompt.md    # The Ralph agent prompt template
├── ralph-loop-kiro-specs-script.sh    # The loop runner script
└── .kiro/
    ├── steering/
    │   ├── product.md                 # What the product is
    │   ├── structure.md               # Project structure conventions
    │   └── tech.md                    # Tech stack and tooling
    └── specs/
        └── <specs_name>/
            ├── requirements.md        # Requirements and exit criteria
            ├── design.md              # Architecture and design decisions
            ├── tasks.md               # Task checklist
            ├── progress.md            # Auto-created: corrections, patterns, progress log
            ├── specs_time.md          # Auto-created: per-task timing
            └── summary.html           # Auto-generated on completion: visual dashboard
```

## Setup Instructions

To set up Ralph Loop in a project:

1. Copy the script and prompt template to the project root:
   - `ralph-loop-kiro-specs-script.sh` — the loop runner (bundled in this skill under `scripts/`)
   - `ralph-loop-kiro-specs-prompt.md` — the agent prompt template (bundled under `references/`)
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x ralph-loop-kiro-specs-script.sh`
3. Ensure the project has Kiro specs set up under `.kiro/specs/<specs_name>/` with at least `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`
4. Ensure steering files exist under `.kiro/steering/` (`product.md`, `structure.md`, `tech.md`) — these significantly improve output quality

## Usage

```bash
./ralph-loop-kiro-specs-script.sh <max_iterations> <specs_name>
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `max_iterations` | Maximum number of loop iterations (positive integer). Each iteration implements one task. Set to at least the number of tasks plus a buffer for retries. |
| `specs_name` | Name of the spec directory under `.kiro/specs/`. Must already exist with the required files. |

### Example

```bash
# Run up to 15 iterations on the "auth-feature" spec
./ralph-loop-kiro-specs-script.sh 15 auth-feature
```

### Iteration Modes

The script asks at startup whether to run automatically or manually:

- **Automatic** — Tasks run back-to-back without pausing. Good for well-defined specs.
- **Manual** — Pauses after each iteration for review. Good for new or unfamiliar specs.

## Troubleshooting

### Ralph gets stuck on a task (marked `[F]`)

Fix the issue manually, update `tasks.md` to unmark the task, and re-run. The corrections from the failed attempt will still be in `progress.md` for the next iteration to learn from.

### Max iterations reached without completion

Increase `max_iterations` and re-run. Ralph will pick up where it left off since it reads `tasks.md` to find the next incomplete task.

### Agent implements more than one task per iteration

This violates the core constraint. Check that you're using the unmodified prompt template. The prompt has a critical constraint section at the top that enforces one-task-per-iteration.

### Steering files are missing

Ralph works without them but produces better results with context. Create `.kiro/steering/product.md`, `structure.md`, and `tech.md` with descriptions of your product, project structure, and tech stack.

## Quality Checklist

Before running Ralph Loop, verify:

- [ ] `kiro-cli` is installed and available on `PATH`
- [ ] Spec directory exists under `.kiro/specs/<specs_name>/`
- [ ] `requirements.md` has numbered requirements with exit criteria
- [ ] `design.md` has architecture and design decisions
- [ ] `tasks.md` has a numbered task checklist with subtasks
- [ ] Steering files exist under `.kiro/steering/` (recommended)
- [ ] `max_iterations` is set to at least the number of tasks + buffer
- [ ] The prompt template (`ralph-loop-kiro-specs-prompt.md`) is in the project root
- [ ] The script (`ralph-loop-kiro-specs-script.sh`) is executable

## Bundled Resources

| Resource | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Runner script | `scripts/ralph-loop-kiro-specs-script.sh` | The bash loop that drives iterations. Copy to project root. |
| Prompt template | `references/ralph-loop-kiro-specs-prompt.md` | The agent prompt template. Copy to project root. |

Read the prompt template when you need to understand the detailed phase instructions, correction format, codebase pattern categories, or the summary dashboard specification.
