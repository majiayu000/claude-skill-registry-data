# Platform Algorithms Deep Dive (2025-2026)

Complete guide to understanding and optimizing for TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook algorithms.

## Algorithm Fundamentals

### How Social Algorithms Work

All major platforms use similar principles:

1. **Content Analysis**: What is the video about?
2. **User Signals**: How do viewers interact?
3. **Creator Signals**: Creator history and behavior
4. **Distribution**: Who should see this content?
5. **Feedback Loop**: Performance adjusts distribution

### Universal Algorithm Truths

**Platforms Want:**
- Users to stay on platform longer
- High engagement (interactions)
- Quality content that satisfies users
- Diverse content discovery

**What Drives Distribution:**
- Watch time (how long people watch)
- Engagement depth (comments > likes)
- Completion rates (especially for short-form)
- Sharing behavior
- Return visits

## TikTok Algorithm (2025)

### Algorithm Signals

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Watch Time | Highest | Total seconds watched |
| Completion Rate | Very High | % of video watched |
| Replays | High | Video watched multiple times |
| Shares | High | Direct shares to others |
| Comments | Medium-High | Written engagement |
| Follows | Medium | New followers from video |
| Likes | Lower (2025) | Heart button taps |

**2025 Update:** Shallow interactions (likes) have reduced weight compared to deeper signals like watch time and replays.

### TikTok's Cold Start System

**How New Videos Are Tested:**

1. Video published
2. Shown to 200-500 initial viewers
3. Performance measured against benchmarks
4. Strong performance = expanded distribution
5. Weak performance = limited to followers

**Cold Start Success Factors:**
- First 3 seconds retention
- Completion rate vs video length
- Early engagement velocity
- Replay rate

### TikTok Content Preferences

**Algorithm Favors:**
- Family-friendly content
- Positive emotional tone
- Educational value
- Authentic creator content
- Micro-niche targeting
- Trending sound usage

**Algorithm Deprioritizes:**
- Controversial/negative content
- Duplicated content
- Low-quality production
- Misleading thumbnails
- Watermarked content from other platforms

### Micro-Niche Prioritization

**2025 Algorithm Change:**
TikTok now heavily favors micro-niche over broad appeal.

**Benefits:**
- Specialized content sees 2.5x better distribution
- Algorithm micro-categorizes: "beginner leg workouts for women" vs just "fitness"
- Niche authority = more algorithm push for new content

**Strategy:**
- Define specific niche clearly
- Use niche-specific language and hashtags
- Build authority in one area before expanding
- Let algorithm understand your content category

### TikTok For You Page (FYP)

**How Videos Reach FYP:**

1. **Initial Test**: Small audience batch
2. **Performance Check**: Engagement metrics evaluated
3. **Expanded Test**: Larger audience if metrics strong
4. **FYP Placement**: Continued performance = broader FYP reach
5. **Ongoing**: Performance at each level determines next reach

**FYP Success Factors:**
- Hook in first 1.3 seconds
- High completion rate
- Strong replay rate
- Trending sound usage
- Relevant hashtags

### TikTok Hashtag Strategy

| Hashtag Type | Purpose | Examples |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Broad/Trending | Reach attempt | #fyp, #viral |
| Category | Topic discovery | #fitness, #cooking |
| Niche | Targeted audience | #beginneryoga, #airfryer |
| Branded | Campaign tracking | #YourBrandChallenge |

**Optimal Strategy:**
- 3-5 hashtags per video
- Mix of niche and category
- Quality over quantity
- Trending hashtags increase engagement 23%

### TikTok Posting Schedule

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Recommended frequency | 1-4 times daily |
| Views in first 24 hours | 68% |
| Peak window improvement | 30% better results |
| Growth with 2-4x daily | 2.5x higher follower growth |
