# Snapchat Ads Campaigns

Strategic guide for managing Snapchat advertising via the Snapchat Marketing API v1. The toolkit is a raw-HTTP client, so parameter types must be sent exactly as documented — strings as strings, integers as integers, and all money in **micro-currency**.

## Requirements

- **Hyper MCP installed and connected.** [https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp](https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp)
- **Snapchat Ads integration connected** (a Snap Business account with ad account access) at [https://app.hyperfx.ai/apps](https://app.hyperfx.ai/apps).

If `search("snapchat_ads_list_organizations")` does not find `snapchat_ads_list_organizations`, stop and tell the user to enable Hyper MCP and connect Snapchat Ads. Creating ad squads or serving ads also requires an **active funding source** on the ad account — campaigns, media, and creatives can be created without one.

### How to run the tools in this skill

Every tool in this skill is named by its canonical tool name. Run it with the call your surface gives you:

| Surface | Find a tool | Run it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP client (Claude, Cursor, Codex, ChatGPT) | `search("<what you want to do>")`, then `describe("<name>")` | `call("<name>", {...})` |
| Hyper CLI | `hyperai search "<what you want to do>"`, then `hyperai describe <name>` | `hyperai call <name> --json '{...}'` |

If a tool is not found, its integration is not connected or not enabled for the workspace: stop and tell the user which integration to connect.

## Out of scope — defer to other skills

- **Creative generation** (ad copy, images, video) → [`ad-creative-generation`](../ad-creative-generation) / [`video-generation`](../video-generation).
- **Cross-platform campaign launches** → use this skill for Snapchat, then invoke `meta-ads` / `tiktok-ads` separately.

## Critical Rules

> **CRITICAL**: All budgets and bids are in **micro-currency**. $1.00 = 1,000,000 micros. $50/day = `50000000`. Never pass dollar amounts directly. Minimum campaign daily budget / lifetime spend cap is **$20** (`20000000`).

> **CRITICAL**: Create campaigns, ad squads, and ads with `status="PAUSED"`. Never launch live without explicit user review. Because everything defaults to PAUSED, you can build a full campaign and delete it without spending — ideal for demos.

> **CRITICAL**: Updates are **JSON-Patch partial updates** — pass only the fields you want to change, parented on the PARENT entity. `snapchat_ads_update_campaign` needs `ad_account_id`; `snapchat_ads_update_ad_squad` needs `campaign_id` (NOT ad_account_id); `snapchat_ads_update_ad` needs `ad_squad_id`.

> **CRITICAL**: Account-level stats (`entity_type="adaccounts"`) only support `fields="spend"`. For impressions / swipes / conversions, query at the **campaign, adsquad, ad, creative, or media** level.

> **CRITICAL**: There is **no `time_range` preset** (e.g. `LAST_30_DAYS` does not exist). Pass `start_time` and `end_time` (ISO 8601). Omitting both returns **lifetime** totals, not a recent window.

> **CRITICAL**: Ad squad `billing_event` is always `IMPRESSION`. `bid_micro` is required for `bid_strategy="LOWEST_COST_WITH_MAX_BID"` and `"TARGET_COST"`; omit it for `"AUTO_BID"`.

> **IMPORTANT**: Creating an ad squad requires an active **funding source** on the ad account. If the account is PENDING / unfunded, ad squad creation fails — that is a billing state, not a bug.

> **IMPORTANT**: Creatives require `top_snap_media_id` (an uploaded media id) and a `headline` (≤ 34 chars). `brand_name` is ≤ 32 chars.

> **IMPORTANT**: For `LOWEST_COST_WITH_MAX_BID` / `TARGET_COST`, don't guess `bid_micro` — get Snapchat's suggested range with `snapchat_ads_get_bid_estimate` (by targeting spec before building, or by ad_squad_id after). Size the audience the same way with `snapchat_ads_get_audience_size` before creating anything.

> **IMPORTANT** (customer lists): `snapchat_ads_add_segment_users` requires identifiers that are **already normalized and SHA-256 hashed** (emails trimmed + lowercased before hashing; phones digits-with-country-code; mobile ad IDs lowercase with hyphens). One schema type per call (`EMAIL_SHA256`, `PHONE_SHA256`, `MOBILE_AD_ID_SHA256`), max 100,000 ids. Never send raw PII. Matching is asynchronous — segment size updates after processing.

|---|---|
| Launch a Snapchat campaign | [references/discovery.md](references/discovery.md) → [references/campaign-creation.md](references/campaign-creation.md) |
| Upload media / create creatives / ad squads / ads | [references/campaign-creation.md](references/campaign-creation.md) |
| Resolve targeting (geo, demo, interests, devices) | [references/targeting.md](references/targeting.md) |
| Build custom audiences / lookalikes / audience insights | [references/targeting.md](references/targeting.md) |
| Estimate audience size / get a suggested bid | [references/campaign-creation.md](references/campaign-creation.md) |
| Set up Snap Pixel / custom conversions | [references/conversions-and-reporting.md](references/conversions-and-reporting.md) |
| Pull stats / async reports / update or delete entities | [references/conversions-and-reporting.md](references/conversions-and-reporting.md) |
| Goal not yet clear | [references/discovery.md](references/discovery.md) — discovery clarifies the goal |

## Campaign Workflow

Discover org/account → audit account → research (objective, audience, budget, assets) → confirm strategy → create campaign (`PAUSED`) → upload media → create creative → create ad squad → create ad → review with user → activate (`update_*` to `ACTIVE`).

## Known Limitations

| Issue | Workaround |
| --- | --- |
| Creative creation fails (historically a silent null error) | Almost always a missing `profile_properties.profile_id` (required for ALL creative types) — pull one from `list_creatives`. The tool now raises a clear error instead of a null "success". |
| Ad creation fails with a type mismatch | Omit `type` so it's derived from the creative (WEB_VIEW → REMOTE_WEBPAGE, etc.). |
| Forecast returns OE101 / UNSUPPORTED_DELIVERY_CONSTRAINT | The tool auto-adds `delivery_constraint`; if it persists, outcome estimation is unavailable for the account type (often PARTNER) — use the Ads Manager reach planner. |
| DAY-granularity stats reject the time range (E1008) | Handled automatically — pass `ad_account_id` to `get_stats`/`create_stats_report` and the tool aligns to account-timezone midnight + hour boundaries. |
| Media rejected with E2601 ("cannot be used to create any creative type") | The file doesn't meet specs — use a 1080×1920 (9:16) PNG/JPG ≤ 5 MB image or 1080×1920 MP4/MOV. Re-generate the asset at the right size, re-upload, and confirm `media_status` is `READY`. |
| Upload fails on file_path / internal URL (Errno 2 / DNS error) | Pass `file_id` (the Hyper file id) instead — it reads from storage directly. Avoid server-local paths and internal `files.*` URLs. |
| Account-level stats reject non-`spend` fields (error E1008) | Query other metrics at campaign/adsquad/ad/creative/media level. |
| No `time_range`/date preset | Pass `start_time` + `end_time`; omitting them returns lifetime totals. |
| Ad squad creation fails on unfunded accounts | Add a funding source; campaigns/media/creatives still work without one. |
| `bid_micro` required for non-AUTO_BID strategies | Provide `bid_micro` for `LOWEST_COST_WITH_MAX_BID` / `TARGET_COST`. |
| Media > 32 MB | Handled automatically (chunked upload, up to 1 GB). |
| Partial updates | Use the update tools (PATCH) with the correct parent id — never resend the whole object. |
| Customer-list upload "succeeds" but the segment stays small | Identifiers must be normalized + SHA-256 hashed before upload; matching is asynchronous and only hashes that match Snapchat users count. Check the segment's `approximate_number_users` after processing. |
| Lookalike creation rejected | Lookalikes need a healthy seed: a FIRST_PARTY segment with enough matched users, `countries` (ISO-2), and `retention_in_days` ≤ 180. |

## Safety Rules

**Never:**

- Assume organization, ad account, campaign, media, or creative IDs — look them up or ask.
- Skip the account audit phase.
- Create campaigns, ad squads, or ads without explicit user approval.
- Set anything to `ACTIVE` without user consent.
- Pass dollar amounts instead of micro-currency.
- Query non-`spend` metrics at the `adaccounts` level.
- Use a `time_range` preset — always pass `start_time`/`end_time`.
- Use `LOWEST_COST_WITH_MAX_BID` / `TARGET_COST` without `bid_micro`.
- Pass the wrong parent id to update tools (ad squad → `campaign_id`, ad → `ad_squad_id`).
