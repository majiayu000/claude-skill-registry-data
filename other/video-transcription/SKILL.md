name: video-transcription
description: Transcribe video and audio files to SRT subtitles with speaker diarization using the Soniox (default) or AssemblyAI API. Use when the user wants to transcribe meetings, videos, or audio files. Supports MKV, MP4, MOV, M4A, MP3. Triggers on "/transcribe", "transcribe my meetings", "transcribe videos in ~/Movies", or any request to convert audio/video to text.

# Video Transcription

Transcribe video and audio files in-place to SRT subtitle format with speaker
diarization. Backed by the `pi-transcribe` CLI (a TypeScript port of the
original standalone skill — no Python).

Two backends. Soniox is the default and writes `<name>.srt`. AssemblyAI is
opt-in via `TRANSCRIBE_BACKEND=assemblyai`, uses the EU endpoint, and writes
`<name>.diarize.srt` — a different suffix, so both can transcribe the same file
and you can compare diarization side by side.

`TRANSCRIBE_BACKEND=both` runs them in one pass: audio is extracted once and
fed to both APIs, producing `<name>.srt` and `<name>.diarize.srt` together. Use
this when the user asks to compare diarization or wants both transcripts.

## Usage

Run the `pi-transcribe` bin, optionally passing a directory or file paths.
Output `.mp3` (extracted audio) and `.srt` (subtitles) files are placed
alongside the source files.

```bash
pi-transcribe [directory | file ...]
```

- **No argument**: scans `~/Movies` (default)
- **Single directory**: scans the specified directory (e.g. a Google Recorder
  `.m4a` export folder)
- **One or more file paths**: transcribes exactly those files

Examples:
- `/transcribe` — transcribe all untranscribed files in `~/Movies`
- `/transcribe /path/to/recordings` — transcribe files in a specific directory
- `pi-transcribe "~/Movies/May 28 at 4-04 PM.m4a" "~/Movies/Feb 2 at 5-05 PM.m4a"` — transcribe specific files
- `TRANSCRIBE_BACKEND=assemblyai pi-transcribe ~/Movies` — use AssemblyAI instead of Soniox (writes `.diarize.srt`, needs `ASSEMBLY_AI_KEY`)
- `TRANSCRIBE_BACKEND=both pi-transcribe ~/Movies` — run BOTH backends in one pass (writes `.srt` + `.diarize.srt`; needs both keys)
- `TRANSCRIBE_BACKEND=assemblyai TRANSCRIBE_LANGUAGE=hu pi-transcribe file.m4a` — pin Hungarian instead of auto-detecting
- `MAX_CHUNK_HOURS=4 pi-transcribe ~/Movies` — change the long-recording chunk size (default 4.5h Soniox / 9h AssemblyAI)
- `TRANSCRIBE_CONCURRENCY=4 pi-transcribe ~/Movies` — change how many files transcribe in parallel (default 8)

## Parallel processing

Files transcribe through a bounded worker pool: up to `TRANSCRIBE_CONCURRENCY`
files (default 8) are in flight at once, overlapping the Soniox wait that
dominates each file's wall-clock time. Files are dispatched oldest-first but may
complete in any order. Set `TRANSCRIBE_CONCURRENCY=1` for serial, deterministic
behavior. The value is clamped to `1`–`100` (100 = the Soniox pending-job cap).

## Execution

1. Run `pi-transcribe`, passing the user's directory/file arguments (if any)
2. The bin handles everything: file discovery, audio extraction, API
   transcription, idempotency (skips files that already have a sibling `.srt`)
3. Present the bin's summary output to the user (total found, already
   transcribed, newly transcribed, failed)
4. If there are failures, report which files failed and the error messages

## Long recordings

Each provider enforces a HARD per-request limit on audio **duration**,
independent of file size: Soniox 18000 s / 5 h, AssemblyAI 10 h. Recordings
longer than the limit are automatically split into `MAX_CHUNK_HOURS`-sized
chunks (default 4.5 h on Soniox, 9 h on AssemblyAI), transcribed separately, and
merged into a single SRT with correct absolute timestamps — full coverage, no
truncation. Override the chunk size with the `MAX_CHUNK_HOURS` env var.

Note: the limit is on duration, not megabytes — a long low-bitrate recording can
be small in size yet still exceed the cap, so the guard probes duration via
ffprobe.

## Prerequisites

- **ffmpeg** (with **ffprobe**) — declared in this package's `pi.tools`
  manifest and resolved through the dashboard tool registry (PATH **or**
  the static npm packages: `ffmpeg-static` for ffmpeg,
  `@ffprobe-installer/ffprobe` for ffprobe — both optionalDependencies
  here). When absent, video files are skipped with a warning; audio-only
  files still process. `pi-dashboard-ensure <package-root>/package.json`
  reports both.
- **The selected backend's API key** — `SONIOX_API_KEY` or `ASSEMBLY_AI_KEY`,
  both declared as `env` probes in `pi.tools`. Same resolver: environment
  first, then an optional gitignored `.env` (current directory, then the skill
  dir). Only the active backend's key is required. No secret ships in the
  package; the bin fails fast with a clear message if the key is unresolved.

### Environment overrides

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TRANSCRIBE_BACKEND` | `soniox` | `soniox`, `assemblyai`, `both`/`all`, or a comma list. Unknown values fall back to `soniox`. |
| `SONIOX_API_KEY` | _(required for soniox)_ | Soniox API key. |
| `ASSEMBLY_AI_KEY` | _(required for assemblyai)_ | AssemblyAI API key. |
| `MAX_CHUNK_HOURS` | `4.5` / `9` | Chunk size for long recordings; default follows the backend's duration cap. |
| `MAX_AUDIO_MB` | `200` | Reserved size guard; `0` disables. |
| `TRANSCRIBE_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | Files transcribed in parallel. Clamped to `1`–`100`; `1` = serial. |
| `TRANSCRIBE_SRT_SUFFIX` | per backend | Override the sibling subtitle suffix (`.srt` / `.diarize.srt`). |
| `TRANSCRIBE_LANGUAGE` | _(unset)_ | AssemblyAI only: pin a language (e.g. `hu`) instead of auto-detecting. |
| `TRANSCRIBE_MAX_SPEAKERS` | _(unset)_ | AssemblyAI only: hard cap on speaker labels. |

### AssemblyAI backend notes

EU endpoint (`api.eu.assemblyai.com`) for data residency. Runs
`speech_models: ["universal-3-5-pro", "universal-2"]` with `speaker_labels` and
`language_detection` on: `universal-3-5-pro` natively covers 18 languages and
anything outside that set (Hungarian included) automatically falls back to
`universal-2` (99 languages). Speaker letters `A`/`B`/`C` are normalised to
`Speaker 1`/`Speaker 2`/`Speaker 3`, so the SRT format is identical to Soniox's.
