# Manus Research

This is the Elves-managed Claude Code alias for `/manus <topic>` and the roster forms
`/manus --wide|--fanout --items-file <roster.json> …`.

Load the installed `elves` skill's **Provider shortcut protocols** and
`references/provider-shortcuts.md`. Resolve `scripts/run_manus.sh` from the active Elves skill root,
keep the target repository as the working directory, validate the arguments and `MANUS_API_KEY`,
and run it. Preserve private visibility, bounded waits, structured coverage, ignored manifests,
and duplicate-safe `--resume` behavior that retries only archived, known-failed steps instead of
improvising API calls. In `--wide` mode Cobbler is the outer orchestrator: it accepts native Wide
Research only after exact roster reconciliation, repairs missing/duplicated items with deterministic
fan-out, and synthesizes last.
