### Step 2: Page Structure by Goal

**Lead generation page:**

1. Hero (headline + subhead + form)
2. Problem agitation
3. Solution introduction
4. What you'll get (lead magnet preview)
5. Social proof (testimonials or logos)
6. Final CTA

**SaaS landing page:**

1. Hero (headline + subhead + CTA + visual)
2. Logo bar (social proof)
3. Problem section
4. Features/benefits (3-4 blocks)
5. How it works (3 steps)
6. Testimonials
7. Pricing
8. FAQ
9. Final CTA

**Sales page (long-form):**

1. Hero (headline + hook)
2. Story/problem
3. Agitation (pain points)
4. Solution reveal
5. Benefits (detailed)
6. Features
7. Social proof (heavy)
8. Bonuses
9. Pricing + guarantee
10. Objection handling
11. Urgency
12. Final CTA

### Step 3: Write Headlines

Use formulas from `examples/formulas-reference.md`:

- **[End result] without [pain point]**
- **The [adjective] way to [outcome]**
- **[Do thing] in [timeframe]**
- **Stop [pain]. Start [pleasure]**
- **Finally, [solution to common problem]**

### Step 4: Build Sections

Use templates from `examples/section-templates.md`:

- Hero section with headline, subhead, CTA, trust indicators
- Problem/agitation section with pain points
- Benefits section with 3 benefit blocks
- How it works (3 steps)
- Social proof (testimonials, logos, stats)
- FAQ for objection handling
- Final CTA with urgency if applicable

### Step 5: Optimize CTAs

**CTA button patterns:**

- Action + benefit: "Get my free guide"
- Immediate value: "Try free for 14 days"
- Remove friction: "No credit card required"
- Personalized: "Start my trial"
- Urgency: "Claim your spot"

## Output Format

```markdown
## Landing Page Copy: [Product/Offer Name]

**Page type:** [Lead gen/Sales/SaaS/etc.]
**Goal:** [Primary conversion action]
**Target audience:** [Who this is for]

---

### Hero Section

### Problem Section

[Pain point identification and agitation]

### Solution/Benefits Section

[3-4 benefit blocks]

### How It Works

[3-step process]

### Social Proof

[Testimonials, logos, stats]

### FAQ

[4-6 objection-handling questions]

### Final CTA

[Closing section with urgency if applicable]

---

### Headline Variants (for A/B testing)

1. [Variant A]
2. [Variant B]
3. [Variant C]
```

## Validation

Before completing:

- [ ] Clear value proposition in headline
- [ ] Audience-specific language used
- [ ] Benefits emphasized over features
- [ ] Social proof included
- [ ] Single clear CTA per section
- [ ] Objections addressed
- [ ] Mobile-friendly structure (scannable)
- [ ] Urgency is authentic, not manipulative

## Error Handling

- **No clear offer**: Ask what specific action visitors should take.
- **No audience defined**: Ask who the ideal customer is and their main pain point.
- **Features only, no benefits**: Convert each feature using "so you can..." framework.
- **No social proof**: Suggest collecting testimonials, or use "trusted by X users" if applicable.
- **Too much text**: Simplify to one key message per section; use bullet points.
