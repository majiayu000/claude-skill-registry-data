# Architectural Patterns for Large React 18 Systems

## Summary

Establish scalable architecture using modular boundaries, domain-driven design, and consistent data access patterns.

## Key Capabilities

- Define domain modules with strict dependency rules.
- Implement façade services to stabilize API contracts.
- Enforce architectural constraints via tooling and lint rules.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Prove architectural consistency under codebase growth.
- Analyze coupling metrics and refactor for minimal entropy.
- Build formal dependency graphs and detect cycles.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Deliver a module dependency map and constraint rules.
- Provide a refactor plan with quantified coupling reductions.
- Demonstrate stable data-access patterns across modules.
