# Delegating

Four ways to offload work. They differ in who does it, whether you wait, and what comes
back. Picking wrong wastes a model call or loses the result.

| Tool | Runs | You get back | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `delegate` | now, same swarm | the finished result | a self-contained sub-task |
| `spawn_specialist` | now, chosen model | the finished result | the sub-task needs a different model or role |
| `mixture_of_agents` | now, several in parallel | one merged answer | quality matters more than cost |
| `submit_job` | in the background | a job id, to poll later | it takes minutes and blocks nothing |

Before any of them, ask whether you can just do it. Delegation costs a full context
build. For anything you can finish in two or three tool calls, doing it yourself is
faster and more reliable.

## delegate

`delegate` with `task`, plus optional `context` and `role`.

The delegate starts COLD. It does not see this conversation. Anything it needs must be in
`task` and `context`: absolute paths, the exact goal, what "done" looks like, and what it
must not touch. A vague `task` returns vague work, and you will not be able to tell that
it misunderstood.

Write `task` as a complete brief a stranger could execute. Include the acceptance
criterion explicitly.

## spawn_specialist

`spawn_specialist` with `role` and `task`, plus optional `context`, `provider` and
`model`.

Same cold start, same briefing rules. Use it when the sub-task wants a specific profile:
a stronger model for a hard piece of reasoning, a cheaper one for bulk extraction, a
local one for something that must not leave the machine.

Leave `provider` and `model` unset unless you have a reason. The default is configured
and works; naming a model that is not available fails the whole call.

## mixture_of_agents

`mixture_of_agents` with `prompt` and `candidates`, plus optional `model`, `provider` and
`api_base`.

Several candidates answer the same prompt, and the answers are merged. Use it for
questions where a single pass is unreliable: an open judgement, a design trade-off, a
summary that must not miss anything.

Do not use it for anything deterministic. Running a command, reading a file or computing
a value has one right answer; asking three models to vote on it costs several times more
and can produce a merged answer that none of them actually gave.

## submit_job

`submit_job` with `script`, plus optional `label`.

Runs in the background. Returns a job id immediately.

1. `submit_job` with the script. Give it a `label`, because a bare id is unreadable in a
   later turn.
2. Keep working. That is the point.
3. `check_job_status` with `job_id` when you need the result.

**Never assume a job succeeded.** Poll with `check_job_status` and read the output before
reporting anything about it. Reporting a background job as done without checking is
fabrication.

If it is still running when you are otherwise finished, say so explicitly instead of
claiming completion.

## cancel_job

`cancel_job` with `job_id`. It asks for approval, because stopping work is a decision.

It stops the job from continuing. It does NOT undo what the job already did. A script
that had written half its files keeps those files; a script that had already called a
remote API has already called it. Cancelling is a way to stop spending, not a way to
return to the state before the job started.

So after a cancel, read the state before you report anything: list the directory the
script was writing to, or query the service it was calling. If you cannot establish what
it managed to do, say exactly that. An unknown outcome is a result, and reporting it as
"cancelled, nothing happened" is the fabrication this whole page is about.

Cancel when the job is provably pointless: its input was wrong, the user changed their
mind, or a faster path is already finished. A job that is merely slow is not a reason.

## Traps

- **The delegate cannot see this conversation.** The single most common failure. Every
  path, every constraint, every already-established fact must be restated in `task` or
  `context`.
- **Do not delegate the whole user request.** Then you are a relay, you cannot verify
  anything, and the result arrives with no one having checked it.
- **Delegating something ambiguous multiplies the ambiguity.** Resolve it first, or ask
  the user, then delegate a clear task.
- **Verify what comes back.** A delegate reporting success is a claim, not a fact. If it
  says it wrote a file, read the file.
- **A job id is not a result.** Nothing has happened until `check_job_status` says so.

## Failure modes

**The delegate returns work that misses the point.** The brief was thin. Do not re-run it
identically: rewrite `task` with the missing constraints spelled out, then retry.

**The delegate says it cannot find a file that exists.** A relative path was passed. It
does not share your working directory. Pass absolute paths.

**`check_job_status` reports failure with no detail.** Run the same script directly with
`shell_exec` to see the real error. Background output is often truncated.

**`mixture_of_agents` returns a bland merge.** The prompt asked for something factual. Do
it in one pass instead.

**`spawn_specialist` fails immediately.** The named `provider` or `model` is not
configured. Drop both fields and retry with the default.
