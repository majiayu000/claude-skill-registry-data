# Project Brainstorming Skill

Guide project ideation through Socratic questioning, constraint analysis, and structured exploration.

## When to Use

- Starting a new project without clear requirements
- Exploring problem space before specification
- Need to compare multiple approaches systematically
- Validating project feasibility and scope

## Integration

**With superpowers**:
- Delegates to `Skill(superpowers:brainstorming)` for Socratic method
- Augments with project-specific patterns
- Uses project brainstorm templates

**Without superpowers**:
- Standalone questioning framework
- Project-focused ideation patterns
- Structured output templates

## Brainstorming Framework

### Phase 1: Problem Definition

**Socratic Questions**:
1. What problem are you solving?
2. Who experiences this problem?
3. What makes this problem worth solving now?
4. What happens if this problem isn't solved?
5. What existing solutions have been tried?

**Output**: Problem statement in docs/project-brief.md

**Template**:
```markdown
## Problem Statement

**Who**: [Target users/stakeholders]
**What**: [The problem they face]
**Where**: [Context where problem occurs]
**When**: [Frequency/timing of problem]
**Why**: [Impact of the problem]
**Current State**: [Existing solutions and limitations]
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

### Phase 2: Constraint Discovery

**Questions**:
1. What are non-negotiable technical constraints?
2. What are resource constraints (time, budget, team)?
3. What integration points are required?
4. What compliance/regulatory requirements apply?
5. What are success criteria and failure modes?

**Output**: Constraints matrix

**Template**:
```markdown
## Constraints

### Technical
- [Constraint 1 with rationale]
- [Constraint 2 with rationale]

### Resources
- **Timeline**: [Duration with milestones]
- **Team**: [Size and skills]
- **Budget**: [If applicable]

### Integration
- [Required system 1]
- [Required system 2]

### Compliance
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Measurable criterion 2]
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

### Phase 3: Approach Generation

**Technique**: Generate 3-5 distinct approaches

**For each approach**:
- Clear description (1-2 sentences)
- Technology stack
- Pros (3-5 points)
- Cons (3-5 points)
- Risks (2-3 points)
- Estimated effort
- Trade-offs

**Template**:
```markdown
## Approach [N]: [Name]

**Description**: [Clear 1-2 sentence description]

**Stack**: [Technologies and tools]

**Pros**:
- [Advantage 1]
- [Advantage 2]
- [Advantage 3]

**Cons**:
- [Disadvantage 1]
- [Disadvantage 2]
- [Disadvantage 3]

**Risks**:
- [Risk 1 with likelihood]
- [Risk 2 with likelihood]

**Effort**: [S/M/L/XL or time estimate]

**Trade-offs**:
- [Trade-off 1 with mitigation]
- [Trade-off 2 with mitigation]
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

### Phase 4: Approach Comparison

**Comparison Matrix**:

| Criterion | Approach 1 | Approach 2 | Approach 3 | Approach 4 |
|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Technical Fit | 🟢 High | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 Low |
| Resource Efficiency | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 High | 🔴 Low | 🟡 Medium |
| Time to Value | 🟢 Fast | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 Slow | 🟢 Fast |
| Risk Level | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low | 🔴 High | 🟡 Medium |
| Maintainability | 🟢 High | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 High | 🔴 Low |

**Scoring**: 🟢 = Good, 🟡 = Acceptable, 🔴 = Concern

### Phase 5: Decision & Rationale

**Selection Criteria**:
1. Alignment with constraints (must satisfy all)
2. Risk vs. reward balance
3. Team capability and experience
4. Time to value
5. Long-term maintainability

**Template**:
```markdown
## Selected Approach: [Approach Name] ⭐

### Rationale
[2-3 paragraphs explaining why this approach was selected]

Key decision factors:
- [Factor 1]
- [Factor 2]
- [Factor 3]

### Trade-offs Accepted
- **Trade-off 1**: [Description] → Mitigation: [Strategy]
- **Trade-off 2**: [Description] → Mitigation: [Strategy]

### Rejected Approaches
- **Approach X**: Rejected because [reason]
- **Approach Y**: Rejected because [reason]
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

## Output: Project Brief

Final output saved to `docs/project-brief.md`:

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Project Brief

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Author**: [Name]
**Status**: Draft | Approved

## Problem Statement
[From Phase 1]

## Goals
1. [Primary goal]
2. [Secondary goal]
3. [Tertiary goal]

## Constraints
[From Phase 2]

## Approach Comparison
[From Phase 3 & 4]

## Selected Approach
[From Phase 5]

## Next Steps
1. `/attune:specify` - Create detailed specification
2. `/attune:plan` - Plan architecture and tasks
3. `/attune:init` - Initialize project structure
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

## Questioning Patterns

### Socratic Method

**Clarification**:
- "What do you mean by [term]?"
- "Can you give an example?"
- "What is the difference between X and Y?"

**Probing Assumptions**:
- "What are you assuming about [aspect]?"
- "Why do you think that assumption is valid?"
- "What if that assumption is wrong?"

**Probing Reasoning**:
- "Why do you think this approach is best?"
- "What evidence supports this?"
- "Are there alternative explanations?"

**Questioning Viewpoints**:
- "What would [stakeholder] think about this?"
- "What are the counterarguments?"
- "How might this fail?"

**Probing Implications**:
- "What happens if we choose this approach?"
- "What are the long-term consequences?"
- "What does this commit us to?"

### Constraint-Based Thinking

**Must Have** (Non-negotiable):
- What absolutely must be true for success?
- What constraints cannot be changed?

**Should Have** (Important):
- What would significantly increase success?
- What preferences matter most?

**Could Have** (Nice to have):
- What would be beneficial but not critical?
- What can we defer or drop if needed?

**Won't Have** (Explicit exclusions):
- What are we explicitly NOT doing?
- What scope boundaries prevent creep?

## Red Flags to Surface

During brainstorming, watch for:
- ⚠️ Vague problem statements ("make it better")
- ⚠️ Unclear success criteria
- ⚠️ Hidden assumptions about users or technology
- ⚠️ Single approach bias (not exploring alternatives)
- ⚠️ Scope creep in requirements
- ⚠️ Unrealistic constraints or timelines
- ⚠️ Missing stakeholder perspectives

## Session State Management

Save session to `.attune/brainstorm-session.json`:

```json
{
  "session_id": "20260102-143022",
  "started_at": "2026-01-02T14:30:22Z",
  "current_phase": "approach-selection",
  "problem": {
    "statement": "...",
    "stakeholders": ["..."]
  },
  "constraints": {
    "technical": ["..."],
    "resources": {"timeline": "...", "team": "..."}
  },
  "approaches": [
    {
      "name": "...",
      "pros": ["..."],
      "cons": ["..."]
    }
  ],
  "selected_approach": null,
  "decisions": {}
}
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.
