  Refresh the CAFleet model list at skills/cafleet/reference/coding-agents.md
  from the approved official pricing and capability sources. Use when a
  maintainer asks to refresh, update, or re-verify the model list, its token
  prices, its context windows, or its freshness, or when a Director reports
  the list was last refreshed more than 30 days ago. Maintainer-invoked only —
  never run automatically during a member spawn.

# CAFleet Model List Refresh

Refresh the repository's model catalogs and canonical Role defaults in
`skills/cafleet/reference/coding-agents.md` — from the approved official
sources, under explicit maintainer review. The repository file is the release
source: a running Director reads only its deployed skill replica, so a refresh
reaches Directors exclusively through the release/deployment transaction below.

This skill maintains each backend's Model catalog, its provenance/context notes, its canonical Role defaults table, and the shared freshness metadata. Preserve Runtime bindings, bound runtime notes, pane-state capture cues, and worked resolutions as runtime documentation owned outside model refreshes. The common catalog preamble specifies maintainer-owned refresh at least every 30 days, a last-refreshed date for model data, standard provider USD per MTok as planning estimates, reviewed capability ordering, and Director ownership of selection policy.

## Approved sources (exhaustive allowlist)

Fetch **only** these five official pages. Search results, third-party price
sites, and social posts are never model-list authority. The first four are
pricing and availability authority; the fifth is capability authority for the
`claude` backend's context windows and Claude Code model-string syntax, and
is never used to price a model.

| Source | What it feeds | URL |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic pricing | `claude` prices | `https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing.md` |
| OpenAI pricing | `codex` prices | `https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing` |
| Codex model availability | `codex` availability | `https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/models.md` |
| OpenCode Zen models and pricing | `opencode` prices and availability | `https://opencode.ai/docs/zen.md` |
| Claude Code model configuration | `claude` context windows and `[1m]` applicability | `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config.md` |

## Refresh procedure

1. **Fetch** all five approved sources. If any source cannot be fetched or
   parsed, **stop**: leave the model list unchanged, report the error, and
   let it become stale rather than fabricating values.
2. **Extract pricing facts only**: the currently effective standard input and
   output prices (USD per MTok) and availability/deprecation qualifiers. Do
   not copy long provider text into the repository, and do not present the
   pricing pages as benchmark evidence — they are pricing/availability
   sources only.
3. **Refresh the `claude` and `codex` tables** from their provider pricing
   pages, and **refresh the `opencode` table** with the dedicated procedure
   below — the Zen catalog behaves differently from the provider pages, so
   follow that procedure exactly. For `codex`, pricing and availability come
   from different pages: price each model from the OpenAI pricing page, but
   take Codex availability from the Codex models page
   (`https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/models.md`) — the table carries only the
   models Codex currently offers in its model picker. A model absent there
   or demoted to a **legacy model** (reachable only via `codex -m` /
   `config.toml`) is removed from the table even when the pricing page
   still prices it; legacy models remain manual pass-through `--model`
   values.
4. **Ask the maintainer for role defaults.** Show the current and available
   catalog tokens for reviewer, monitor, and other members on each backend.
   Ask which model each role should use and, for Claude and Codex, which
   supported effort level should accompany it. Record the maintainer's
   choices in the proposed diff. OpenCode omits effort because its backend
   does not support it. A refresh keeps the existing role defaults only when
   the maintainer explicitly chooses to keep them.
5. **Reapply the capability classes explicitly.** The `Class` descriptions
   and the most-to-least-capable row ordering are reviewed maintainer
   judgment, not provider benchmark claims; changing a class or the ordering
   requires reviewed policy approval in the same pull request. Every row
   carries both prices from its approved source. Set the six Role defaults
   from the maintainer's choices, using local catalog entries or aliases and
   effort levels accepted by the selected backend.
6. **Re-verify every `claude` row's context window on every refresh**, even
   when the prices are unchanged. Take each window from the Claude Code model
   configuration page's *Extended context* section and record it in the
   `claude` table's `Context` column. That page is also the authority for
   whether a row's `--model` value carries the `[1m]` suffix, which is a
   Claude Code model-string suffix stripped before the request reaches the
   provider — it is meaningless for the `codex` and `opencode` tables, whose
   values never carry it. Apply the suffix only where it changes the window a
   member actually gets:
   - A model the page lists as always running at 1M on the Anthropic API
     carries **no** suffix — the window is already 1M and the suffix is inert.
   - A model the page gives no 1M variant carries **no** suffix.
   - A model without 1M support carries **no** suffix; appending it there is a
     malformed value.
   - Where the page shows the window is opt-in for the reader's plan, the
     suffix belongs in the page's note rather than the row, so the Director
     applies it per spawn against the operator's plan instead of every
     spawn inheriting a credit-billed window.

   A suffixed value must be single-quoted everywhere it appears in a command,
   because `[1m]` is a glob pattern that fails an unquoted zsh invocation.
7. **Propose, then apply atomically.** Generate a concise proposed diff and
   require explicit maintainer approval before applying the model-data changes in
   `skills/cafleet/reference/coding-agents.md`. Preserve the common catalog
   preamble contract described above. Apply catalogs, provenance/context notes,
   Role defaults, and the *last refreshed* date together after approval and
   successful validation. The Director's staleness check reads that date, so
   every successful refresh keeps it present and current. A failed refresh
   makes **no** edit.

## OpenCode Zen procedure (the `opencode` table)

The `opencode` backend is priced by the OpenCode Zen page, and its catalog
behaves differently from the two provider pages: model IDs differ from
display names, the page lists many models while cafleet curates a few, and
free stealth/preview models appear and disappear. On **every** refresh, even
when the claude/codex prices are unchanged:

1. **Price from the Zen page only.** Zen's own USD-per-MTok rates are the
   billing rates for the `opencode` backend. Never price a Zen model from the
   upstream vendor's page (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, …) — the Zen rate is
   the one cafleet members are billed at.
2. **Copy the Zen model ID exactly; never slugify the display name.** The
   page shows a display name ("GLM 5.2", "Kimi K2.7 Code") and a distinct
   model ID (`glm-5.2`, `kimi-k2.7-code`). The row's `--model` value is
   `opencode/<zen-model-id>` — the literal `opencode/` prefix followed by the
   ID copied verbatim from the page. A hand-derived slug that does not match
   the Zen ID fails at spawn time.
3. **Re-verify every curated row against the page.** For each existing row,
   confirm the model is still listed on Zen and its price is current. A
   delisted model's row is removed in the same refresh.
4. **Handle free models by their published price.** A model Zen offers free
   for a limited time is priced `0.00` in both columns. When the free offer
   ends: update the row to the newly published Zen price, or remove the row
   if the model disappears or has no published price.
5. **Keep the table a curated subset.** Do not mirror the full Zen catalog —
   keep a handful of reviewed models spanning the price range. Adding or
   removing a curated model is a reviewed policy change, approved in the same
   pull request like any class or ordering change.

## Cadence and staleness

Refresh the model list at least every 30 days and whenever the user asks for
a refresh. A stale list disables cost efficiency mode — the Director relays
an operator choice for those spawns — until a maintainer refreshes the model
list, commits the repository source, and completes the release/deployment
transaction.

## Release-coupled deployment

There is no model-list-only sync path: a committed source file alone does not
refresh a running Director's asset copy. To deploy a refreshed model list, the
maintainer:

1. Bumps the CAFleet release version.
2. Builds the release binary with the repository `skills/` tree embedded,
   including `skills/cafleet/reference/coding-agents.md`, and publishes the
   per-target release archives.
3. Upgrades the installed CLI to that release and runs `cafleet setup`, which
   installs its embedded skill payload for the selected backends, including
   the unified reference. The binary upgrade and setup complete the deployment.

Installing skills directly from a checkout is a separate contributor operation;
it does not replace the embedded-binary build/release → upgrade → setup path.

## Ownership boundary

This skill owns model catalogs, provenance/context notes, canonical Role defaults,
and freshness metadata in the unified reference. Runtime documentation maintenance
owns Runtime bindings, bound notes, pane cues, and worked resolutions. The CAFleet
Director owns per-spawn selection under `skills/cafleet/roles/director.md`; `cafleet member create` remains the execution
boundary.
