# Arrange-Act-Assert

Organize each test into three distinct sections: Arrange (set up test data and mocks), Act (execute the code being tested), Assert (verify the expected outcome). Keep each section focused. A single blank line can separate sections. This structure makes tests easy to read and understand. Given-When-Then is the BDD equivalent.
