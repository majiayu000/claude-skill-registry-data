name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints with proper HTTP methods, status codes, and consistent naming conventions. Use this skill when creating or modifying API routes, endpoints, or server-side request handlers. When working on files in src/pages/api/, files containing API route definitions, files implementing REST endpoints, files handling HTTP requests and responses, server middleware for API requests, API authentication and authorization logic, and files defining API versioning strategies. When designing URL structures for resources, implementing query parameter handling for filtering/sorting/pagination, setting up rate limiting for API endpoints, or configuring CORS and API security headers.

# Backend API

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.

## When to use this skill

- When creating or editing API route files (e.g., `src/pages/api/*.ts`, `src/pages/api/*.js`)
- When implementing RESTful endpoints with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE methods
- When designing resource-based URL structures and route hierarchies
- When handling query parameters for filtering, sorting, pagination, or search functionality
- When defining API response formats and HTTP status codes
- When implementing API versioning strategies (URL path or header-based)
- When setting up rate limiting, throttling, or API quota management
- When configuring API security headers, CORS policies, or authentication middleware
- When writing server-side request handlers or middleware functions
- When working on API documentation or OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
