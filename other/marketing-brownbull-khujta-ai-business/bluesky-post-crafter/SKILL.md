# Bluesky Post Crafter Skill

## Platform Fundamentals

Bluesky is fundamentally different from Twitter/X:

| Aspect | Bluesky | Twitter/X |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Algorithm | User-controlled, multiple feeds | Platform-controlled |
| Character limit | 300 | 280 (more for Premium) |
| Discovery | Hashtags + custom feeds | Algorithmic "For You" |
| Links | No penalty | Historically penalized |
| Ads | None | Extensive |
| Verification | Link your domain (free) | Paid subscription |

**Key insight**: There's no algorithm to "beat." Growth comes from conversations and community.

## Post Specifications

### Character Limits
- **Post**: 300 characters
- **Hashtags**: Up to 100 characters each
- **Alt text**: 1,000 characters

### Media Support
- Images: Up to 4 per post
- Videos: Up to 60 seconds
- GIFs: Supported
- External links: No reach penalty

### Formatting
- No native thread feature (yet) — deliver message in single post
- Hashtags are clickable and searchable
- Alt text is expected (community values accessibility)

## Hashtag Strategy

Bluesky doesn't have a trending page — hashtags are your discovery mechanism.

### Optimal Usage
- **2-3 hashtags per post** for best results
- Niche hashtags > broad hashtags
- Hashtags drive custom feed inclusion

### Placement Options
```
Beginning: Immediately categorizes content
End: Maintains readability (most common)
```

### Effective Hashtags

**Community hashtags:**
```
#BlueskyCommunity
#BlueskyArt
#BlueskyTech
#BlueskyWriting
```

**For tacosdedatos:**
```
#DataScience #DataViz #Python
#Programación #DatosAbiertos
#BlueskyEspañol #LatAm
```

### Hashtag Performance

- Trending-aligned hashtags can increase visibility by **40%**
- Timely participation in trending topics: **15-25% engagement boost**
- Niche tags lead to deeper community engagement

## Content Types That Work

### 1. Introductions

"Hi, I'm new to Bluesky" posts perform exceptionally well. The community is welcoming.

```
Template:
¡Hola! Soy [nombre], escribo sobre [temas].

Me pueden encontrar en:
→ Newsletter: [link]
→ [Otros]

Emocionado/a de estar aquí. ¿Quién más escribe sobre [tema]?

#BlueskyEspañol #DataScience
```

### 2. Value-First Posts

```
Template:
[Insight or tip — direct, no preamble]

[Supporting detail or context]

[Optional: Question to spark discussion]

#RelevantHashtag
```

### 3. Behind-the-Scenes

Humanizes your brand, builds trust.

```
Template:
Así se ve mi [proceso/día/setup]:

[Image or description]

[Brief context]

¿Cómo es el suyo?
```

### 4. Questions & Discussion Starters

Open-ended questions drive engagement.

```
Template:
Pregunta para la comunidad:

[Specific, thoughtful question about your niche]

Me interesa escuchar diferentes perspectivas.
```

### 5. Quote Posts

More visible than replies. Use to:
- Add your take to someone's post
- Restart conversations from older posts
- Share others' content with commentary

### 6. External Links

No algorithm penalty — share freely.

```
Template:
[Context about what you're sharing]

[Link]

[Why it matters or what you learned]
```

## Replies as Distribution

Unlike algorithmic platforms, **replies get surfaced in Discover feed**.

### Reply Strategy

- Replies to others = visibility for you
- Thoughtful replies attract profile visits
- Early replies (within 15 min) on popular posts = more exposure

### What Makes a Good Reply

**Do:**
- Add new insight or perspective
- Ask follow-up questions
- Share relevant experience

**Don't:**
- "Great post!" (no value)
- One-word responses
- Self-promotional without relevance

## Threading on Bluesky

No native thread feature, but you can:

1. **Self-reply** to create thread
2. **Bump old threads** — replying to your own old post brings it to top of followers' feeds

### Thread Structure

```
Post 1: [Hook + main point]
↓ (reply to self)
Post 2: [Supporting detail]
↓
Post 3: [Conclusion + CTA]
```

## Posting Frequency & Timing

### Frequency
- **Optimal**: 1-2 posts/day
- **Minimum**: A few times/week
- **Key**: Engagement > volume

### Best Times (2025)
| Day | Best Windows |
|-----|--------------|
| Monday | 8-10 AM, 6-8 PM |
| Wed-Thu | 9 AM - noon, 3-5 PM |
| Weekend | Lower activity |

*Times in audience's local timezone*

### Important Difference

Posts don't disappear in seconds like Twitter. Conversations can stretch for days. Less urgency, more depth.
