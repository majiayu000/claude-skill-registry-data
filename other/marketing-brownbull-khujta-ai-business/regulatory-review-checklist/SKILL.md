# Regulatory Review Checklist Skill

## When to Use
- Launching campaigns or assets that require HIPAA, FDA, or local regulatory approval.
- Auditing existing assets for compliance gaps.
- Training new marketers on required review steps prior to launch.

## Framework
1. **Pre-Check** – confirm intake form completeness, asset inventory, and claim references.
2. **Reviewer Matrix** – map required reviewers (legal, medical, privacy, compliance, brand) with SLAs.
3. **Asset Checklist** – copy, creative, disclaimers, data flows, tracking tags, localization.
4. **Decision Logging** – capture approvals, conditions, expiration dates, and link to evidence.
5. **Post-Launch Monitoring** – adverse event reporting, change control, re-review triggers.

## Templates
- Review routing sheet with reviewer roles, due dates, and status.
- Asset checklist spreadsheet covering copy, creative, landing pages, data capture.
- Decision log template for audits and regulator requests.

## Tips
- Bundle assets into batches (e.g., email + landing + paid ads) to streamline approvals.
- Track expiration dates for approvals tied to clinical evidence updates.
- Pair with `run-compliance-review` and `orchestrate-patient-journey` commands.
