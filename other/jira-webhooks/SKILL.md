# Jira Webhooks

## When to Use This Skill

- How do I receive Jira webhooks?
- How do I verify Jira webhook signatures?
- How do I handle `jira:issue_created` or `jira:issue_updated` events?
- Why is my Jira webhook signature verification failing?
- Understanding Jira event types and payloads

## Verification (core)

For **admin webhooks** (created on the Jira admin **WebHooks** page or via
`POST /rest/webhooks/1.0/webhook`) saved with a `secret`, Jira Cloud signs the
**raw** request body with HMAC-SHA256 keyed on that secret. It sends the digest in
the `X-Hub-Signature` header (not `X-Hub-Signature-256`) using the WebSub
`method=signature` format, i.e. `sha256=<hex>`. Verify the raw body **before**
parsing JSON and compare timing-safe.

> Admin webhooks without a `secret` are unsigned. App webhooks use a different
> scheme: Connect descriptor webhooks get a JWT signed with the app's `sharedSecret`, and
> OAuth 2.0 dynamic webhooks (`POST /rest/api/3/webhook`) get a bearer JWT signed
> with the app's client secret, both in the `Authorization` header. See
> [references/verification.md](references/verification.md).

Node:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyJiraWebhook(rawBody, signatureHeader, secret) {
  const [method, sig] = (signatureHeader || '').split('=');
  if (method !== 'sha256' || !sig) return false;
  const expected = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(rawBody).digest('hex');
  try {
    return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(sig, 'hex'), Buffer.from(expected, 'hex'));
  } catch {
    return false; // length mismatch = invalid
  }
}
```

Python:

```python
import hmac, hashlib

def verify_jira_webhook(raw_body: bytes, signature_header: str, secret: str) -> bool:
    method, _, sig = (signature_header or "").partition("=")
    if method != "sha256" or not sig:
        return False
    expected = hmac.new(secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(sig, expected)
```

## Common Event Types

Jira does **not** send an event-type header. The event name is in the JSON body
under the `webhookEvent` field.

| Event (`webhookEvent`) | Triggered When |
|------------------------|----------------|
| `jira:issue_created` | An issue is created |
| `jira:issue_updated` | An issue is edited or transitioned |
| `jira:issue_deleted` | An issue is deleted |
| `comment_created` | A comment is added to an issue |
| `comment_updated` | A comment is edited |
| `comment_deleted` | A comment is deleted |
| `worklog_created` | A worklog is logged on an issue |

> **For the full event reference**, see [Jira webhook events](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/webhooks/#events).

## Important Headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-Hub-Signature` | HMAC SHA-256 signature, formatted `sha256=<hex>` (admin webhooks with a `secret`) |
| `Authorization` | JWT on Connect descriptor and OAuth 2.0 app webhooks (the docs describe it only for app webhooks) |
| `X-Atlassian-Webhook-Identifier` | Unique delivery identifier |

## Environment Variables

```bash
JIRA_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret   # The `secret` set on the admin webhook
```

## Local Development

```bash
# Start tunnel (no account needed)
npx hookdeck-cli listen 3000 jira --path /webhooks/jira
```
