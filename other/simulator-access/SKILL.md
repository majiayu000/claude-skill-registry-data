  Simulator.Company access-control specialist — who can view/modify/remove/sign/execute an
  object (actor, form, account, template, tree layer). Use when the user wants to share or
  unshare an object, grant or revoke permissions, list who has access, or bulk-share. Activate
  when the user says "share this with", "give access to", "grant permission", "revoke access",
  "who can see/edit this", "set permissions", "make read-only", "поділись з", "надай доступ",
  "забери доступ", "хто має доступ", "права доступу", "дай доступ", "открой доступ",
  "отзови доступ", "кто имеет доступ", "права доступа". Also activate when a tool fails because
  the caller has NO access to an object — "request access", "I can't see this actor",
  "access denied", "403", "no permission", "запроси доступ", "немає доступу", "немає прав",
  "відмовлено в доступі", "запроси доступ", "нет доступа", "доступ запрещён". For the object's
  own data use the domain skill (`simulator-actors` / `simulator-forms` / `simulator-finance`).

# Simulator.Company Access-Control Specialist

Access rules say **who** (a user, SA user, or group) can do **what** (view / modify / remove /
sign / ds / execute) to an **object**. Grants are applied **asynchronously** — save calls
return a **`taskId`**.

## The model

- **objType** — one of `actor`, `form`, `account`, `formTemplate`, `templateActors`, `treeLayer`.
- **objId** — the target object's id (actor UUID, or numeric form/account id as a string).
- **rules** — a JSON **array** of operations: `{action, data}` where `action ∈ create | update | delete`.
- **data** — identifies the grantee by **exactly one** of `userId` | `saId` | `groupId`, plus:
  - **privs** — `{view, modify, remove (required booleans), sign?, ds?, execute?}`. `view` is
    implied when any other privilege is set.
  - **reactionOrders?** — `{sign, ds, execute}` positive integers ordering those reactions
    (same number = parallel, higher waits for lower). **Optional** — pass it only to set a
    sequence. A user holding `sign`/`ds`/`execute` without an order still counts toward task
    completion; once anyone on the object has an order, such a user acts after the ordered users
    of that stage. On `update` of an actor's own access, resend `reactionOrders` to keep the
    sequence — omitting it clears the stored order. A graph/layer cascade never touches
    `sign`/`ds`/`execute` or their orders on the actors inside.
- **recursive** (default **true**) — cascade to child objects. Set **false** to apply to this object only.
- **notify** (default **true**) — send access-change notifications. Set **false** to apply quietly.

> `recursive`/`notify` default to true; the tools send an explicit `false` when you set it, so an
> opt-out is honoured. "Grant but don't cascade to children" ⇒ `recursive=false`.

## Workspace context

Objects are addressed by their own id (`objId`), so most tools need no `accId`. Only
`bulkSaveAccountPairsAccessRules` takes an `accId` (defaults to the configured workspace).

## Finding the grantee (`userId` / `groupId`)

A rule's grantee is identified by a real `userId` (or `saId` / `groupId`) — resolve it first,
never guess:

- **`searchUsers(accId, query)`** — find a workspace member by name/email (the quickest path).
- **`getUsers(accId)`** — list all members.
- **`getUser(accId, userId, type="group")`** — resolve a group id when sharing with a group.

> **Share onto the `user`, never their twin actor.** Each user has a 1:1 digital-twin actor,
> but access is granted to the **`userId`** — pass `userId` in the rule's `data`, not the twin
> actor's id. The twin actor is for *transactions / accounts / graph placement*
> (`getSystemActor`), not for sharing. See `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/docs/entities/users.md`.

## Read who has access

```
getAccessRules(objType="actor", objId="<actor UUID>")      # actor | form | account | formTemplate | treeLayer
getTemplateActorsAccess(objId="<form-template id>")        # the actors of a form template
getTreeLayerAccess(objId="<layer / root actor id>")        # the actors on a tree layer
```

## Grant / change / revoke

```
# Give user 4210 view + modify on an actor, but not delete:
saveAccessRules(objType="actor", objId="<actor UUID>", rules=[
  { "action": "create", "data": {
      "userId": 4210,
      "privs": { "view": true, "modify": true, "remove": false } } }
])

# Revoke a group's access to an account entirely:
saveAccessRules(objType="account", objId="<account id>", rules=[
  { "action": "delete", "data": { "groupId": 88 } }
])

# Apply to this object only (don't cascade) and stay quiet:
saveAccessRules(objType="actor", objId="<UUID>", recursive=false, notify=false, rules=[ … ])
```

`saveTemplateActorsAccess(objId=<form-template id>, rules=[…])` and
`saveTreeLayerAccess(objId=<layer id>, rules=[…])` take the same `rules` shape for the
template-actor and tree-layer scopes.

## Bulk

```
# Many objects at once (≤50), each with its own rules:
bulkSaveAccessRules(items=[
  { "objType": "form", "objId": "42", "rules": [ … ] },
  { "objType": "actor", "objId": "<UUID>", "rules": [ … ] }
])

# Share a whole account-name category across the workspace (every account named <prefix>_*):
bulkSaveAccountPairsAccessRules(accId="ws_xxx", items=[
  { "objId": "<account-name id prefix>", "rules": [ … ] }
])
```

## Requesting access (when YOU can't see an object)

Mid-task a tool may fail with **403 / Access Denied** (or `getActor` etc. returns not-found)
because the current user has **no `view` access** to that object. Don't give up or guess —
ask the owner for access with **`requestAccess`**:

```
requestAccess(objType="actor", objId="<actor UUID>")          # request view access
requestAccess(objType="actor", objId="<actor UUID>", modify=true)   # request view + edit
```

- `requestAccess` does **not** grant access — it raises a request to the object's **owner(s)**
  (creates a REQUEST_ACCESS invite + a request-access event they can approve/decline). You then
  have to wait for approval before the blocked operation will work.
- **Idempotent:** a pending request for the same object is reused, not duplicated — calling it
  again is safe and returns the existing invite + `requestEventId`.
- You do **not** need access to the object to call it (it's the one access tool that works
  without `view`). `objType` is usually `actor`; it also accepts `form` / `account` / template
  / `treeLayer`.
- This is the **requesting** side. **Approving** a request is the owner granting access — i.e.
  a normal `saveAccessRules(... privs:{view:true})` on the object (or the owner acts on the
  request-access event in the UI).

> When a read/write step is blocked by access, tell the user it's blocked, call `requestAccess`,
> and report that approval is pending — rather than failing silently or inventing data.

## Tips

- A save returns a **`taskId`** (applied async); the change may take a moment to fully propagate.
- Identify the grantee by **exactly one** of `userId` / `saId` / `groupId`.
- `privs.view/modify/remove` are required; `sign`/`ds`/`execute` optional. Setting any privilege implies `view`.
- `reactionOrders` is optional — a single executor needs only `execute:true`.
- `recursive=false` ⇒ this object only; `notify=false` ⇒ no notifications (both honoured).
- **Blocked by access?** Use `requestAccess(objType, objId)` — it asks the owner (doesn't grant); approval is needed before retrying. It's the one access tool callable without `view`.
- Use `action:"delete"` (grantee id only) to revoke; `create`/`update` to grant or change.
- Resolve user/group ids first (don't guess) — grantees must belong to the workspace or the rule is rejected.
