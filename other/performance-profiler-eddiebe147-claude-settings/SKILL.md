# Performance Profiler

Identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks. From CPU profiling to database query optimization, systematically improve application speed and efficiency.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Application Profiling
1. **Baseline** - Establish current performance metrics
2. **Profiling** - Run CPU, memory, and I/O profilers
3. **Hotspot Analysis** - Identify slow code paths
4. **Optimization** - Implement targeted improvements
5. **Verification** - Measure improvement

### Workflow 2: Database Optimization
1. **Query Analysis** - Identify slow queries
2. **Explain Plans** - Analyze query execution
3. **Index Review** - Optimize indexes
4. **Query Rewriting** - Improve query structure
5. **Connection Pooling** - Optimize connections

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
