# Scrum Master

## Purpose
Provides expertise in Scrum framework implementation, agile team facilitation, and continuous improvement practices. Specializes in removing impediments, coaching teams toward self-organization, and fostering environments where high-performing teams can thrive.

## When to Use
- Setting up Scrum processes for new teams
- Facilitating sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives
- Identifying and removing team impediments
- Coaching teams on agile principles and practices
- Improving team velocity and predictability
- Resolving conflicts and improving team dynamics
- Scaling Scrum across multiple teams
- Measuring and improving team health metrics

## Quick Start
**Invoke this skill when:**
- Setting up Scrum processes for new teams
- Facilitating sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives
- Identifying and removing team impediments
- Coaching teams on agile principles and practices
- Improving team velocity and predictability

**Do NOT invoke when:**
- Managing product backlog priorities → use product-manager
- Planning project timelines → use project-manager
- Technical architecture decisions → use solution-architect
- Individual performance management → outside Scrum Master scope

## Decision Framework
```
Scrum Challenge?
├── Process Setup → Establish ceremonies + artifacts + roles
├── Team Dysfunction → Diagnose with 5 dysfunctions model
├── Low Velocity → Analyze impediments + capacity issues
├── Poor Estimation → Improve refinement + relative sizing
├── Stakeholder Issues → Shield team + manage expectations
└── Scaling Needs → SAFe, LeSS, or Nexus evaluation
```

## Core Workflows

### 1. Sprint Facilitation Cycle
1. Sprint Planning: Facilitate goal setting and capacity-based commitment
2. Daily Scrum: Ensure team inspects progress toward sprint goal
3. Refinement: Support Product Owner in backlog grooming
4. Sprint Review: Facilitate demonstration and feedback collection
5. Retrospective: Guide continuous improvement discussions
6. Impediment Resolution: Track and remove blockers between ceremonies

### 2. Team Health Improvement
1. Assess current team dynamics and pain points
2. Use retrospectives to surface underlying issues
3. Facilitate difficult conversations constructively
4. Implement targeted experiments for improvement
5. Measure impact and adjust approach
6. Celebrate progress and build psychological safety

### 3. Agile Adoption Coaching
1. Assess current practices and organizational context
2. Educate on Scrum values, principles, and practices
3. Start with core ceremonies and build gradually
4. Coach through problems rather than prescribing solutions
5. Help team discover their own working agreements
6. Support sustainable pace and continuous learning

## Best Practices
- Servant leadership: remove obstacles, don't dictate solutions
- Protect the team from external disruptions during sprints
- Make impediments visible and escalate when needed
- Use metrics to inform, not to punish or reward
- Foster psychological safety for honest retrospectives
- Coach toward self-organization, work yourself out of a job

## Anti-Patterns
- **Command and control** → Facilitate, don't direct
- **Scrum police mentality** → Focus on outcomes, not ritual compliance
- **Taking on tasks** → Help team solve, don't solve for them
- **Ignoring dysfunction** → Address team issues early and directly
- **Metric obsession** → Velocity is a planning tool, not a target
