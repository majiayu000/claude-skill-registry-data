# Dividend Analysis — AIsa Edition

Analyze dividend metrics for one or more tickers using the AIsa API. This is a read-only research helper: it does not connect to brokerage accounts, place orders, make purchases, or manage portfolios.

## Usage

```bash
python3 scripts/dividends.py JNJ
python3 scripts/dividends.py JNJ PG KO
python3 scripts/dividends.py JNJ PG KO --output json
```

### Arguments

- **Tickers**: One or more dividend-paying stock symbols. Inputs are validated before they are sent to the model.
- `--output json`: Append structured JSON summary

## Permission Boundary

- The only required secret is `AISA_API_KEY`.
- Requests go to `https://api.aisa.one/v1` by default.
- `AISA_BASE_URL` is optional and should only point to a trusted AIsa-compatible HTTPS endpoint.
- Do not provide brokerage credentials, trading passwords, cookies, or payment details. This skill has no purchase or order-placement workflow.

## Analysis Output

For each ticker, the analysis includes:

- **Core Metrics**: Yield, ex-date, frequency, last payment amount
- **Payout Analysis**: Payout ratio, FCF payout, coverage ratio
- **Growth**: 1Y, 3Y CAGR, 5Y CAGR, consecutive years of increases
- **Last 5 Annual Dividends** table
- **Safety Score (0-100)**: Based on payout ratio (25pts), FCF coverage (20pts), growth consistency (20pts), balance sheet (15pts), earnings stability (10pts), consecutive years (10pts)
- **Income Rating**: Excellent (80+), Good (60-79), Moderate (40-59), Poor (<40)
- **Dividend Aristocrat/King** status check

When multiple tickers are provided, a ranked comparison table is included.

**NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.** For informational purposes only.
