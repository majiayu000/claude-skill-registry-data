# Customer Journey Mapper

Visualize and optimize every step of the customer experience from first awareness to loyal advocacy. This skill helps you understand how customers actually interact with your brand, identify friction points, and design experiences that convert and retain.

Customers don't think in channels - they think in experiences. This skill provides frameworks for journey stage definition, touchpoint mapping, emotion tracking, and gap analysis. Transform siloed channel thinking into holistic experience design that meets customers where they are.

Essential for marketing strategists, CX professionals, product managers, and anyone designing customer experiences.

## Best Practices

- **Start with research** - Journeys should reflect reality, not assumptions
- **Map from customer perspective** - Their experience, not your processes
- **Include emotions** - How they feel matters
- **Be specific** - "Awareness" is too vague; define clearly
- **Cross-functional input** - Sales, support, product all have insight
- **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Can't fix everything at once
- **Moments of truth** - Focus on make-or-break experiences
- **Measure journey health** - Metrics at each stage
- **Iterate continuously** - Journeys evolve
- **Visualize effectively** - Maps should be scannable
- **Include offline** - Physical experiences count
- **Consider negative paths** - Map what happens when things go wrong
- **Segment journeys** - Different personas, different journeys
- **Test changes** - Validate improvements with real customers
- **Share broadly** - Journey maps inform entire organization
