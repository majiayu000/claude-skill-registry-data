# Verify a Nano (XNO) Payment

Nano (XNO) is a feeless, instant, green digital currency settled peer-to-peer on a
single ledger with no issuer. When an agent is paid for work in Nano, the sender
tells it a block hash or an amount — but a claim is not a settlement. This skill
shows an agent how to confirm, from the ledger itself, that a payment actually
landed: the block exists, it is confirmed, it pays the agent's own
receive address, and its `amount` matches what was owed. It is strictly
read-only and needs no wallet, no seed and no API key — the public Nano RPC
(`rpc.nano.to`) answers every query used here.

## Why this is a real need

The whole point of agent payments is that an agent should not ship work or
release credentials on a promise. If you can read the ledger, you never have to
trust the payer's word. A pay-per-call or bounty agent should, before delivering,
answer three questions:

1. Does a block with the claimed hash exist and is it confirmed?
2. Was it sent to MY address? For a `send` block that is `contents.link_as_account`
   (the block's own account is the sender); for a `receive`/`open` block it is `block_account`.
3. Is the raw `amount` at least what was owed?

Each is one read-only RPC call. Nothing here signs, spends or touches funds.

## Installation

### Direct repo/manual install

Clone the Agent Skill Exchange repository and copy this skill directory into
the skill folder used by your agent runtime:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentskillexchange/skills.git
cp -R skills/skills/verify-nano-payment ~/.agent-skills/verify-nano-payment
```

### No install needed for the core technique

The skill's core technique needs no install at all: it is one read-only JSON
POST to the public Nano RPC over plain `curl` (shown below). The optional
`verify_payment.py` helper uses only the Python standard library, so it needs
no `pip install`. An HTTP client in any language (Node `fetch`, Python
`urllib`, `requests`, or a plain shell `curl`) can replicate it without
adding a dependency.

## Reading the ledger (curl, no key)

The Nano RPC is a simple JSON POST to a public node. Set a short timeout and,
for safety, only ever READ — never pass a `private_key` or `wallet` in an action.

### 1. Confirm a block exists and is confirmed — `block_info`

```bash
curl -sS -m 15 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"block_info","json_block":"true","hash":"8161FEE8C0A1676D7965A4771DBFA9937D88ECB4FFBE5DF36E431672D107D604"}' \
  https://rpc.nano.to/
```

The response names the block's account (`"block_account"`), the raw `amount`,
the `balance`, and — the key field — `"confirmed":"true"`. Only a confirmed
block is final; Nano finality is sub-second but a node reports confirmation
explicitly, so read it before acting.

### 2. Read the pay-to account from the block — not the request body

Which field names the recipient depends on the block's `subtype`:

- `send`: `block_account` / `contents.account` is the **sender**; the recipient
  is `contents.link_as_account`.
- `receive` / `open`: `block_account` / `contents.account` is the recipient.

Compare that field to the address you expect to be paid into, so either the
payer's send hash or your own receive hash can be checked. Never trust a `payTo` field sent alongside a request; the ledger block is
the source of truth.

```bash
curl -sS -m 15 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"block_info","json_block":"true","hash":"<BLOCK_HASH>"}' \
  https://rpc.nano.to/ \
  | jq '{subtype, block_account, to: .contents.link_as_account, amount, confirmed}'
```

### 3. Check the account state — `account_info`

To confirm the receiving account is live and see its current balance (a balance
increase is the practical proof a receive landed):

```bash
curl -sS -m 15 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"account_info","account":"nano_1yo6c1t64ahfjdw1dxizmbbnpdmbrckwhw9phbg5pdkeubrizga4qhnjmnx7"}' \
  https://rpc.nano.to/
```

## A small helper script

Save `verify_payment.py` (dependency-free, stdlib only) next to this skill and
call it before you ship work after being told "you have been paid in Nano":

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Verify a Nano (XNO) payment read-only. Exit 0 only when the block is
confirmed AND it pays the expected receive address: for a send block that is
contents.link_as_account, for a receive/open block it is block_account."""
import json, sys, urllib.request

RPC = "https://rpc.nano.to/"

def rpc(action, **params):
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        RPC, data=json.dumps({"action": action, **params}).encode(),
        headers={"Content-Type": "application/json",
                 "User-Agent": "nano-payment-verify/1.0"}, method="POST")
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req, timeout=15) as r:
        return json.load(r)

def main():
    block = sys.argv[1]
    expect_addr = sys.argv[2]          # your Nano receive address
    expect_min_raw = int(sys.argv[3])  # minimum raw units owed (1 XNO = 10**30)
    info = rpc("block_info", json_block="true", hash=block)
    subtype = info.get("subtype")
    contents = info.get("contents") or {}
    if subtype == "send":
        # A send block belongs to the sender; the recipient is link_as_account.
        addr = contents.get("link_as_account")
    elif subtype in ("receive", "open"):
        addr = info.get("block_account") or contents.get("account")
    else:
        print(f"NOT_A_PAYMENT {subtype}"); sys.exit(1)
    amount = int(info.get("amount", "0"))
    if info.get("confirmed") != "true":
        print("NOT_CONFIRMED"); sys.exit(1)
    if addr != expect_addr:
        print(f"WRONG_ADDRESS {addr}"); sys.exit(1)
    if amount < expect_min_raw:
        print(f"AMOUNT_SHORT {amount}"); sys.exit(1)
    print(f"OK {amount} raw to {addr}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Usage:

```bash
python3 verify_payment.py 8161FEE8C0A1676D7965A4771DBFA9937D88ECB4FFBE5DF36E431672D107D604 \
  nano_1yo6c1t64ahfjdw1dxizmbbnpdmbrckwhw9phbg5pdkeubrizga4qhnjmnx7 0
```

Only a `0`/OK exit means the agent may deliver: the block is on the ledger,
confirmed, pays the expected account, for at least the expected raw amount.
The hash may be the payer's `send` block or your own `receive`/`open` block; any
other subtype (`change`, `epoch`) is rejected with `NOT_A_PAYMENT`.

## Safety

- This skill only READS the public ledger. Never add `private_key`, `wallet`,
  `seed`, or `destination` to any request — that would be trying to spend, which
  a verify skill must never do without explicit wallet tooling.
- Treat the ledger as the source of truth; a payment claim from chat is not
  settled until the block says so.
