# Inngest Integration

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/inngest` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Inngest Integration Inngest expert for serverless-first background jobs, event-driven workflows, and durable execution without managing queues or workers.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Capabilities, Scope, Tooling, Patterns, Validation Checks, Collaboration.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- User mentions or implies: inngest
- User mentions or implies: serverless background job
- User mentions or implies: event-driven workflow
- User mentions or implies: step function
- User mentions or implies: durable execution
- User mentions or implies: vercel background job

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Capabilities

- inngest-functions
- event-driven-workflows
- step-functions
- serverless-background-jobs
- durable-sleep
- fan-out-patterns
- concurrency-control
- scheduled-functions

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @inngest to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @inngest against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @inngest for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @inngest using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Events are the primitive - everything triggers from events, not queues
- Steps are your checkpoints - each step result is durably stored
- Sleep is not a hack - Inngest sleeps are real, not blocking threads
- Retries are automatic - but you control the policy
- Functions are just HTTP handlers - deploy anywhere that serves HTTP
- Concurrency is a first-class concern - protect downstream services
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicates - use them for critical operations

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/inngest`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Patterns

### Basic Function Setup

Inngest function with typed events in Next.js

**When to use**: Starting with Inngest in any Next.js project

// lib/inngest/client.ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest';

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: 'my-app',
  schemas: new EventSchemas().fromRecord<Events>(),
});

// Define your events with types
type Events = {
  'user/signed.up': { data: { userId: string; email: string } };
  'order/placed': { data: { orderId: string; total: number } };
};

// lib/inngest/functions.ts
import { inngest } from './client';

export const sendWelcomeEmail = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: 'send-welcome-email' },
  { event: 'user/signed.up' },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // Step 1: Get user details
    const user = await step.run('get-user', async () => {
      return await db.users.findUnique({ where: { id: event.data.userId } });
    });

    // Step 2: Send welcome email
    await step.run('send-email', async () => {
      await resend.emails.send({
        to: user.email,
        subject: 'Welcome!',
        template: 'welcome',
      });
    });

    // Step 3: Wait 24 hours, then send tips
    await step.sleep('wait-for-tips', '24h');

    await step.run('send-tips', async () => {
      await resend.emails.send({
        to: user.email,
        subject: 'Getting Started Tips',
        template: 'tips',
      });
    });
  }
);

// app/api/inngest/route.ts (Next.js App Router)
import { serve } from 'inngest/next';
import { inngest } from '@/lib/inngest/client';
import { sendWelcomeEmail } from '@/lib/inngest/functions';

export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [sendWelcomeEmail],
});

### Multi-Step Workflow

Complex workflow with parallel steps and error handling

**When to use**: Processing that involves multiple services or long waits

export const processOrder = inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: 'process-order',
    retries: 3,
    concurrency: { limit: 10 },  // Max 10 orders processing at once
  },
  { event: 'order/placed' },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const { orderId } = event.data;

    // Parallel steps - both run simultaneously
    const [inventory, payment] = await Promise.all([
      step.run('check-inventory', () => checkInventory(orderId)),
      step.run('validate-payment', () => validatePayment(orderId)),
    ]);

    if (!inventory.available) {
      // Send event instead of direct call (fan-out pattern)
      await step.sendEvent('notify-backorder', {
        name: 'order/backordered',
        data: { orderId, items: inventory.missing },
      });
      return { status: 'backordered' };
    }

    // Process payment
    const charge = await step.run('charge-payment', async () => {
      return await stripe.charges.create({
        amount: event.data.total,
        customer: payment.customerId,
      });
    });

    // Ship order
    await step.run('ship-order', () => fulfillment.ship(orderId));

    return { status: 'completed', chargeId: charge.id };
  }
);

### Scheduled/Cron Functions

Functions that run on a schedule

**When to use**: Recurring tasks like daily reports or cleanup jobs

export const dailyDigest = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: 'daily-digest' },
  { cron: '0 9 * * *' },  // Every day at 9am UTC
  async ({ step }) => {
    // Get all users who want digests
    const users = await step.run('get-users', async () => {
      return await db.users.findMany({
        where: { digestEnabled: true },
      });
    });

    // Send to each user (creates child events)
    await step.sendEvent(
      'send-digests',
      users.map(user => ({
        name: 'digest/send',
        data: { userId: user.id },
      }))
    );

    return { sent: users.length };
  }
);

// Separate function handles individual digest sending
export const sendDigest = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: 'send-digest', concurrency: { limit: 50 } },
  { event: 'digest/send' },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // ... send individual digest
  }
);

### Webhook Handler with Idempotency

Safely process webhooks with deduplication

**When to use**: Handling Stripe, GitHub, or other webhooks

export const handleStripeWebhook = inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: 'stripe-webhook',
    // Deduplicate by Stripe event ID
    idempotency: 'event.data.stripeEventId',
  },
  { event: 'stripe/webhook.received' },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const { type, data } = event.data;

    switch (type) {
      case 'checkout.session.completed':
        await step.run('fulfill-order', async () => {
          await fulfillOrder(data.session.id);
        });
        break;

      case 'customer.subscription.deleted':
        await step.run('cancel-subscription', async () => {
          await cancelSubscription(data.subscription.id);
        });
        break;
    }
  }
);

### AI Pipeline with Long Processing

Multi-step AI processing with chunked work

**When to use**: AI workflows that may take minutes to complete

export const processDocument = inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: 'process-document',
    retries: 2,
    concurrency: { limit: 5 },  // Limit API usage
  },
  { event: 'document/uploaded' },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // Step 1: Extract text (may take a while)
    const text = await step.run('extract-text', async () => {
      return await extractTextFromPDF(event.data.fileUrl);
    });

    // Step 2: Chunk for embedding
    const chunks = await step.run('chunk-text', async () => {
      return chunkText(text, { maxTokens: 500 });
    });

    // Step 3: Generate embeddings (API rate limited)
    const embeddings = await step.run('generate-embeddings', async () => {
      return await openai.embeddings.create({
        model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
        input: chunks,
      });
    });

    // Step 4: Store in vector DB
    await step.run('store-vectors', async () => {
      await vectorDb.upsert({
        vectors: embeddings.data.map((e, i) => ({
          id: `${event.data.documentId}-${i}`,
          values: e.embedding,
          metadata: { chunk: chunks[i] },
        })),
      });
    });

    return { chunks: chunks.length, status: 'indexed' };
  }
);
