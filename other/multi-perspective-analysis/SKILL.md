# Multi-Perspective Analysis Skill

Assemble and coordinate teams of virtual expert personas to analyze complex problems from multiple perspectives, generating insights unavailable from any single viewpoint.

## When to Use This Skill

- Complex architectural decisions requiring diverse expertise
- Strategic planning needing multiple domain perspectives
- Problems spanning multiple technical or business domains
- Decisions with competing valid approaches
- Situations requiring productive disagreement to find best solutions

## Team Assembly Framework

### Complexity Scaling

| Complexity | Team Size | Structure |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Simple | 3-4 experts | Single-phase analysis, direct synthesis |
| Moderate | 5-6 experts | Two-phase analysis, structured disagreement |
| Complex | 7-9 experts | Multi-phase with hierarchical synthesis |
| Enterprise | 10+ experts | Teams-of-teams coordination |

### Team Composition Template

```markdown
## [Problem Domain] Expert Team

**Mission**: [Clear statement of team purpose]

### Team Composition

#### [Expert Title] (ID)
**Background**: [Relevant expertise]
**Domain Vocabulary**: [5-7 key terms]
**Characteristic Question**: "[What they always ask]"
**Analytical Lens**: [Unique perspective]
```

## Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Pattern
Best for: Problems with clear dependency chains
```
Expert A → Expert B → Expert C → Synthesis
(Each builds on previous insights)
```

### Parallel Pattern
Best for: Problems needing diverse simultaneous perspectives
```
Expert A ─┐
Expert B ─┼→ Synthesis
Expert C ─┘
(Independent analysis, combined insights)
```

### Dialectical Pattern
Best for: Problems with competing valid approaches
```
Thesis (Expert A) ←→ Antithesis (Expert B) → Synthesis
(Structured opposition yields breakthrough)
```

### Hierarchical Pattern
Best for: Complex multi-level decisions
```
Strategic Layer (Experts A, B)
        ↓
Tactical Layer (Experts C, D, E)
        ↓
Operational Layer (Experts F, G)
        ↓
    Synthesis
```

## Voice Differentiation Guidelines

Each expert maintains distinct:
- **Vocabulary**: 10-15 domain-specific terms
- **Questions**: 2-3 signature questions they always ask
- **Metaphors**: Teaching analogies from their field
- **Reasoning**: Characteristic analytical patterns

## Expert Contribution Template

```markdown
### [Expert Title] Perspective

Looking at this through my lens as a [role], I notice...

**Key Insight**: [Primary contribution from this perspective]
**Trade-off Identified**: [What this view reveals about tensions]
**Recommendation**: [Actionable guidance from this expertise]
**Next Question**: [What this reveals we should explore]
```

## Disagreement Protocol

### Intensity Levels

1. **Gentle** (refinement-focused)
   - "This approach has merit, but what if..."
   - Edge case identification, optimization suggestions

2. **Systematic** (methodology-challenging)
   - "While the goal is sound, I question whether..."
   - Alternative framework proposals, evidence evaluation

3. **Rigorous** (premise-challenging)
   - "I fundamentally question whether we're solving the right problem..."
   - Paradigm alternatives, success criteria redefinition

4. **Paradigmatic** (worldview-challenging)
   - "What if everything we think we know is wrong?"
   - Revolutionary approaches, constraint elimination

## Synthesis Template

```markdown
## Expert Team Synthesis

### Convergent Insights
[Where experts agree and why this matters]

### Creative Tensions
[Where perspectives productively differ]
- Tension 1: [Expert A] vs [Expert B] on [issue]
- Resolution approach: [How to honor both]

### Integrated Solution
[Unified approach that honors multiple viewpoints]

### Emergent Discoveries
[Insights that emerged only from combining perspectives]

### Implementation Path
1. [First action]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action]
```

## Success Indicators

- Generation of insights unavailable from single perspectives
- Successful assumption challenging leading to better solutions
- Effective voice differentiation across experts
- Productive disagreement resolved into robust outcomes
- Clear actionable recommendations with trade-off awareness
