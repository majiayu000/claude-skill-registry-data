# Keyword Research Systems Skill

## When to Use
- Kicking off a new product/vertical SEO plan.
- Validating which clusters justify net-new content.
- Refreshing legacy keyword maps with updated volumes/intent.

## Framework
1. **Seed Intake** – capture ICP, problems solved, solution terms.
2. **Expansion Sources** – combine auto-suggest, People Also Ask, competitor URLs, forums.
3. **Classification** – assign funnel stage + intent (informational, commercial, transactional, navigational).
4. **Scoring** – evaluate search volume, keyword difficulty, SERP click potential, seasonality.
5. **Prioritization** – stack rank via ICE/RICE or weighted scoring tied to business impact.

## Templates
- Cluster worksheet `Topic → Intent → Page Type → Owner`.
- SERP teardown table (result type, schema, search feature presence).
- Opportunity score calculator (volume * intent-fit / difficulty).

## Tips
- Map 1 pillar page for every 4-6 cluster articles to support internal linking.
- Track query freshness to schedule refresh cadences.
- Align with paid search data to spot immediate conversion opportunities.
