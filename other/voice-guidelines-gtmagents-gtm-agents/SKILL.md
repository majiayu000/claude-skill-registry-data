# Voice & Style Guidelines Skill

## When to Use
- Reviewing copy for tone consistency.
- Localizing copy for new regions or verticals.
- Training new writers or agencies on brand standards.

## Framework
1. **Voice Pillars** – e.g., confident, empathetic, pragmatic (with examples).
2. **Tone Ladder** – how tone shifts by channel, funnel stage, or audience.
3. **Style Rules** – grammar, punctuation, casing, formatting, banned phrases.
4. **Accessibility** – reading level, inclusive language, jargon policy.
5. **Localization Notes** – regional terminology, regulatory statements, measurement units.

## Templates
- Do/Don’t example library.
- Localization matrix (region, language, required changes).
- Voice feedback form (issue, recommendation, owner).

## Tips
- Revisit guidelines quarterly; align with positioning updates.
- Pair with `message-architecture` for consistent structure.
- Track exceptions (e.g., partner co-branding) to avoid conflicting signals.
