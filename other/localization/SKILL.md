# Localization

The scripts work on any Xcode String Catalog (`.xcstrings`). They auto-discover
the catalog by searching the project for `.xcstrings` files (preferring
`Localizable.xcstrings` when several exist) and can be pointed at a specific
one with the `L10N_FILE` env var. Run `l10n.sh file` to see which catalog is
targeted.

String catalogs are usually too large to open with the Read/Edit tools — use
the scripts instead. They operate on the catalog with `jq`, write changes back
atomically, and re-serialize to Xcode's exact on-disk format (Xcode writes
`"key" : value` with spaces around the colon; without normalization every edit
would produce a huge spurious git diff).

Both scripts resolve the project root from their own location, so they can be
run from any working directory.

## l10n.sh

`.claude/skills/localization/scripts/l10n.sh <command> [args]`

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `file` | Print the resolved catalog path |
| `keys` | List all translatable keys |
| `search <pattern>` | Search keys (case-insensitive) |
| `search-values <pattern>` | Search translation values; prints `key⇥lang⇥value` |
| `get <key>` | Show all translations for a key (raw JSON) |
| `comment <key> [text]` | Show or set the translator comment for a key |
| `set <key> <lang> <value>` | Set a single translation |
| `set-plural <key> <lang> <cat> <value>` | Set a plural variant (`zero\|one\|two\|few\|many\|other`) |
| `batch-set <file.tsv>` | Bulk set from a TSV file (`key`⇥`lang`⇥`value`), single pass |
| `missing <lang>` | Keys missing **or pending** (state ≠ `translated`) for `<lang>` |
| `stats [lang]` | Per-language translated counts, plus pending/stale totals |
| `stale` | Keys Xcode marked `extractionState: "stale"` (removed from code) |
| `rename <old> <new>` | Rename a key, preserving translations |
| `delete <key> [lang]` | Delete a key, or just one language's translation |
| `normalize` | Re-serialize the file to Xcode's exact `.xcstrings` format |

### Notes

- **Adding a new string:** set the source-language value first (e.g.
  `set "New key" en "New key"`), then other languages, then a translator
  comment (`comment <key> <text>`). Keys are created on first `set`.
- **Bulk translations:** prefer `batch-set` over many `set` calls — it applies
  all rows in one pass. Build a TSV with one `key⇥lang⇥value` row per cell;
  `\n` and `\t` escapes in values become real newlines/tabs.
- **Plurals:** a localization holds either a flat value or variations, never
  both — `set` refuses keys that use variations; use `set-plural`, which also
  converts a flat value to plural form. Fill every category the language
  requires (English: one/other; Russian: one/few/many/other; …).
- **Languages:** use the BCP-47 codes as they appear in the catalog (`en`,
  `de`, `fr`, …). Run `stats` to see which languages exist.
- `set`, `set-plural`, and `batch-set` mark each unit `state: "translated"`.
- **Renaming keys:** Xcode re-extracts strings from code on every build, so
  also update the source references or the old key comes back.

## find_unused_keys.sh

`.claude/skills/localization/scripts/find_unused_keys.sh`

Lists catalog keys not referenced anywhere in the project sources (Swift,
ObjC, storyboards/xibs). Matching accounts for format specifiers (`%@`,
`%lld`, …), Swift string-escape forms, and interpolation; placeholder-only
keys it cannot verify are listed separately. Matching is textual, so keys
built dynamically at runtime are invisible to it — verify each hit, then
remove confirmed-unused keys with `l10n.sh delete <key>`. Cross-check with
`l10n.sh stale` for keys Xcode itself no longer extracts.

## Best practices

Full guidance distilled from Apple's docs lives in
[references/best-practices.md](references/best-practices.md) — consult it when
writing or reviewing localizable Swift code. The short version:

- SwiftUI literals in `Text`/`Label`/etc. are auto-localizable; elsewhere use
  `String(localized:)`, and pass strings around as `LocalizedStringResource`,
  not `String`. In frameworks/packages, pass `bundle: #bundle`.
- Give every string a translator comment describing where it appears and what
  its placeholders are.
- Never concatenate sentence fragments or branch on plural count in code — use
  one key with interpolation, and plural variations for counts.
- Never hand-format user-visible dates, numbers, currencies, measurements, or
  lists — use Foundation's `formatted(…)` styles, which localize per locale.
- Mark brand names and symbols `shouldTranslate: false` instead of deleting
  them; keep unreviewed machine translations in `needs_review` state.
