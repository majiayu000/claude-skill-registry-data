### Step 1: UGC Source Identification

| Source    | Content Type           | Discovery Method                  |
| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Instagram | Photos, Reels, Stories | Hashtag, mention, tag             |
| TikTok    | Videos, duets          | Hashtag, mention                  |
| Twitter/X | Photos, videos, text   | Mention, hashtag, keyword         |
| YouTube   | Videos, shorts         | Brand search, comments            |
| Reviews   | Text, photos           | Product pages, Google, Trustpilot |

Identify brand handles, branded hashtags, review platforms, and monitoring keywords.

### Step 2: Content Discovery

Search platforms using:

- Branded hashtags (#brandname)
- @mentions and tags
- Product name + review/haul/unboxing
- Location tags (stores, events)

Track discoveries in a log with: date, platform, creator, content type, link, quality, status.

See [examples/discovery-templates.md](examples/discovery-templates.md) for search queries by platform.

### Step 3: Content Quality Assessment

**Quality scoring (1-5 each):**

- Visual quality (lighting, focus) - 25%
- Brand visibility (product shown) - 20%
- Authenticity (genuine, not staged) - 20%
- Sentiment (positive message) - 15%
- Creator audience size - 10%
- Diversity (unique perspective) - 10%

**Quality tiers:**
| Tier | Score | Usage |
|------|-------|-------|
| A-tier | 4.5-5.0 | Hero content, ads, homepage |
| B-tier | 3.5-4.4 | Social, product pages, email |
| C-tier | 2.5-3.4 | Social carousel, testimonials |

### Step 4: Permission Requests

Always request permission before using UGC. Send friendly DM or email explaining:

- What content you want to use
- Where it will appear
- Credit you'll provide
- Any perks offered

Track: creator, platform, content, date requested, response, rights granted.

See [examples/permission-templates.md](examples/permission-templates.md) for request templates.

### Step 5: Content Organization

Tag content by:

- **Type**: photo, video, review, testimonial
- **Product**: SKU or category
- **Theme**: lifestyle, product-focus, results
- **Quality**: tier-a, tier-b, tier-c
- **Rights**: social-approved, web-approved, ads-approved
- **Status**: pending-permission, approved, published

### Step 6: Content Formatting

**Social reposts**: Credit creator, add context, include product link
**Website**: Gallery format, square crops, shoppable if possible
**Email**: Featured customer section with quote

See [examples/formatting-templates.md](examples/formatting-templates.md) for repost formats.

### Step 7: Distribution Planning

| Channel           | UGC Type          | Frequency       |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Instagram Feed    | Photos, videos    | 2-3x/week       |
| Instagram Stories | All types         | Daily           |
| Email             | Reviews, quotes   | Weekly          |
| Website           | Photos, reviews   | Monthly refresh |
| Ads               | High-quality only | Ongoing tests   |
| Product pages     | Product-specific  | Ongoing         |

### Step 8: Creator Relationships

| Tier  | Followers | Approach             |
| ----- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Micro | 1K-10K    | DM, product gifting  |
| Mid   | 10K-50K   | Email, collaboration |
| Macro | 50K+      | Formal partnership   |

Nurture relationships: thank publicly, add to VIP list, offer early access.
