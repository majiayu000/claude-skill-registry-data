## Instructions

### Step 1: Lead Magnet Type Selection

| Type        | Pages | Best For              | Effort |
| ----------- | ----- | --------------------- | ------ |
| Checklist   | 1-3   | Quick wins, processes | Low    |
| Cheat sheet | 1-2   | Reference, shortcuts  | Low    |
| Template    | 1-5   | Workflows, documents  | Low    |
| Toolkit     | 3-10  | Resource collection   | Medium |
| Guide       | 10-20 | How-to, tutorials     | Medium |
| Report      | 15-30 | Research, data        | Medium |
| Ebook       | 20-50 | Comprehensive topics  | High   |
| Workbook    | 15-40 | Exercises, worksheets | High   |

### Step 2: Ebook Structure

**Front Matter (3-5 pages):** Cover, title page, about author, table of contents, introduction

**Body (15-40 pages):** 4-8 chapters covering foundation, core concepts, implementation

**Back Matter (2-4 pages):** Summary, resources, about company, CTA page

| Ebook Length   | Chapters | Pages per Chapter |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Short (15-20)  | 3-4      | 3-4 pages         |
| Medium (25-35) | 5-6      | 4-5 pages         |
| Long (40-50)   | 7-8      | 5-6 pages         |

### Step 3: Chapter Structure

Each chapter includes:

- Opening hook (1-2 paragraphs)
- Key concepts (2-3 sections with examples)
- Callout boxes (pro tips, warnings, checklists)
- Chapter summary with takeaways
- Action step for reader

See [examples/content-templates.md](examples/content-templates.md) for chapter and callout templates.

### Step 4: Front & Back Matter

**Introduction template:** Who this is for, what you'll learn (3 outcomes), how to use the guide, about author/company.

**CTA page:** Bridge from content to offer, what's included, clear call-to-action with link.

See [examples/content-templates.md](examples/content-templates.md) for full templates.

### Step 5: Design Specifications

Provide design brief with: brand colors (hex), fonts, page size, margins, visual style, and recurring element styles (chapter openers, callout boxes, pull quotes).

### Step 6: Landing Page Copy

Include: headline, subheadline, hero image, problem statement, "what you'll learn" bullets, "what's inside" chapter list, "who this is for" qualifiers, form, and trust elements.

See [examples/promotion-templates.md](examples/promotion-templates.md) for landing page structure.

### Step 7: Email Sequence

4-email nurture sequence:

1. **Delivery (immediate)**: Thank you + download link
2. **Value add (day 2)**: Common mistake + tip
3. **Case study (day 4)**: Success story related to topic
4. **Conversion (day 6-7)**: CTA to next step

See [examples/promotion-templates.md](examples/promotion-templates.md) for email templates.

### Step 8: Quick Lead Magnets

For simpler formats (checklist, cheat sheet), use streamlined templates in [examples/quick-templates.md](examples/quick-templates.md).

## Error Handling

- **Topic too broad**: Narrow to specific outcome or audience segment.
- **No clear conversion goal**: Define what reader should do next before writing.
- **Content too thin**: Add case studies, examples, or data.
- **Too long for format**: Split into series or reduce scope.
- **No existing content**: Start with outline; use research to fill gaps.
