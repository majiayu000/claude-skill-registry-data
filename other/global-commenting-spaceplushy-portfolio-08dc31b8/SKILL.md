name: Global Commenting
description: Write purposeful code comments that explain the "why" behind technical decisions, complex logic, and non-obvious implementations using JSDoc for components and APIs. Use this skill when documenting component props, explaining complex algorithms, noting performance optimizations, documenting workarounds, or adding API documentation. When working on component prop interfaces requiring JSDoc documentation, complex business logic or algorithms, performance optimization rationale, browser compatibility workarounds or hacks, API route documentation with request/response formats, configuration file explanations, Content Collection schema documentation, or regex patterns and what they match.

# Global Commenting

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global commenting.

## When to use this skill

- When documenting component props with JSDoc (@prop, @param annotations)
- When explaining complex algorithms, business logic, or non-obvious implementation choices
- When documenting performance optimizations and the rationale behind them
- When noting browser compatibility issues or workarounds for bugs
- When documenting API routes with request/response format specifications
- When explaining Content Collection Zod schemas and validation constraints
- When clarifying regex patterns and what they're designed to match
- When documenting configuration files (astro.config.mjs, tailwind.config.mjs)
- When adding file-level documentation headers for complex components or utilities
- When explaining technical debt, TODOs, or future refactoring needs
- Avoiding commenting obvious code, change history (use git), or commented-out code blocks
