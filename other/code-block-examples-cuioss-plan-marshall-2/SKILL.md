# Code Block Examples Test Skill

This skill demonstrates the relative path pattern in documentation.

## Purpose

A reference library skill showing usage patterns.

## Relative Path Pattern

**Example usage in skills**:
```
Read references/core-principles.md
bash scripts/analyzer.py
Load template: assets/template.html
```

The above is just documentation showing the pattern - these files don't actually exist in this skill.

## Real Resources

This skill has one actual reference file:

Read references/actual-guide.md

## Notes

The code block examples above are for documentation purposes only.
