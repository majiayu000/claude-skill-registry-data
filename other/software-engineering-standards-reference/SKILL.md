# Software Engineering Standards Reference

Software engineering standards provide established best practices for development, quality assurance, and project management. Use this skill to properly reference standards and find the appropriate standard for your needs.

## When to Use

- Citing standards in documentation or specifications
- Establishing organizational development processes
- Creating quality assurance plans
- Developing project management frameworks
- Writing requirements, design, or test documentation

## Standard Naming Convention

Use this format when referencing IEEE, ISO, EIA, or IEC standards:

```
[Organization] Std [Number]-[Year], [Title]
```

**Components**:
- **Organization**: IEEE, ISO, EIA, IEC, or combination (e.g., IEEE/EIA)
- **Number**: Unique standard identifier (e.g., 830, 12207)
- **Year**: Year the standard was adopted (e.g., 1998, 2002)
- **Title**: Full descriptive title of the standard

**Examples**:
- `IEEE Std 830-1998, Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications`
- `IEEE/EIA Std 12207-1997, Information Technology—Software Life Cycle Processes`
- `ISO/IEC Std 12207, Information Technology—Software Life Cycle Processes`

## Top-Level Lifecycle Standard

**ISO/IEC 12207** (Information Technology—Software Life Cycle Processes)

- **Purpose**: Defines the lifecycle framework for developing and managing software projects
- **US Adoption**: IEEE/EIA Std 12207
- **Scope**: Top-level standard covering the entire software development and management lifecycle

## Finding the Right Standard

Standards are organized by domain and purpose. Consult the reference lists in `references/standards-lists.md` for:

- **Development standards**: Requirements, design, configuration management, user documentation, maintenance
- **Quality assurance standards**: QA plans, reviews, unit testing, test documentation, quality metrics
- **Management standards**: Project management, lifecycle processes, productivity metrics, acquisition, risk management

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Identify your domain**: Determine whether you need development, QA, or management standards
2. **Find the specific standard**: Use the categorized lists to locate the standard matching your activity
3. **Apply the naming convention**: Reference standards using the proper format
4. **Check for updates**: Verify you are using the current version of the standard
