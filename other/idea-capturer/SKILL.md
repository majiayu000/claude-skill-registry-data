# Idea Capturer

The Idea Capturer skill provides a structured system for capturing fleeting thoughts, developing raw ideas into actionable concepts, and organizing your creative thinking. Rather than losing good ideas to forgetting or scattered notes, this skill creates a reliable "second brain" for ideation and creative work.

This skill applies principles from Zettelkasten note-taking, David Allen's GTD capture system, and creative thinking methodologies to help you externalize thoughts quickly, connect ideas across domains, and develop half-formed notions into fully realized concepts. The focus is on reducing friction in the capture moment while adding structure that makes ideas findable and actionable later.

The system distinguishes between quick captures (fleeting thoughts), developed notes (explored concepts), and connected insights (synthesized understanding), providing appropriate workflows for each stage of idea development.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Quick Capture
Immediate idea recording with minimal friction:
1. **Dump**: Get the idea out of your head fast
2. **Tag**: Add 1-3 keywords for findability
3. **Context**: Where did this come from? Why does it matter?
4. **Type**: Is this a project, question, observation, or inspiration?
5. **Future Action**: Develop now, schedule later, or just archive?

### Workflow 2: Idea Development
Transform raw thought into developed concept:
1. **Expand**: Flesh out the basic idea
2. **Question**: What makes this interesting? What's unclear?
3. **Connect**: How does this relate to other ideas or knowledge?
4. **Research**: What do you need to learn to develop this?
5. **Application**: How might you use this?
6. **Next Steps**: What's the very next action?

### Workflow 3: Idea Organization
Structure your idea collection:
1. **Review**: Scan recent captures
2. **Categorize**: Group related ideas
3. **Connect**: Link ideas that inform each other
4. **Prioritize**: What deserves development time?
5. **Archive**: What's no longer relevant?
6. **Surface**: What keeps coming up?

### Workflow 4: Brainstorming Session
Generate many ideas around a theme:
1. **Problem/Prompt**: What are we ideating about?
2. **Divergent Phase**: Generate without judgment (quantity over quality)
3. **Clustering**: Group similar ideas
4. **Convergent Phase**: Identify most promising
5. **Development**: Take top ideas deeper
6. **Action Planning**: What to do with winners

### Workflow 5: Idea Synthesis
Connect ideas into original thinking:
1. **Pattern Recognition**: What themes emerge?
2. **Cross-Pollination**: How do disparate ideas connect?
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Where do ideas contradict?
4. **Novel Combinations**: What new insights emerge?
5. **Expression**: Write, sketch, or prototype the synthesis

## Idea Frameworks

### The Idea Capture Hierarchy

**Tier 1: Fleeting Notes**
Quick captures, raw thoughts, passing inspirations
- Purpose: Don't forget
- Lifespan: Hours to days
- Process: Must be reviewed and either developed or discarded

**Tier 2: Literature Notes**
Insights from reading, conversations, observations
- Purpose: Remember what you learned
- Lifespan: Permanent (if valuable)
- Process: Summarize in your own words, tag for retrieval

**Tier 3: Permanent Notes**
Developed ideas, original thinking, synthesized insights
- Purpose: Build knowledge
- Lifespan: Permanent
- Process: Connect to related notes, refine over time

**Tier 4: Project Notes**
Ideas organized around specific initiatives
- Purpose: Take action
- Lifespan: Duration of project
- Process: Active development until completed or abandoned

### The SCAMPER Ideation Method

For developing and improving ideas:

- **S**ubstitute: What can be swapped out?
- **C**ombine: What can be merged?
- **A**dapt: What can be adjusted for new context?
- **M**odify: What can be changed (bigger, smaller, different)?
- **P**ut to other uses: What else could this do?
- **E**liminate: What can be removed?
- **R**everse: What if we did the opposite?

### The 5 Why's for Idea Development

**Initial idea**: "I should build a productivity app"

- **Why?** Because I'm frustrated with current tools
- **Why?** They're too complex for simple needs
- **Why?** They try to do everything
- **Why?** They're designed for teams, not individuals
- **Why?** Market incentives favor enterprise sales

**Refined idea**: "Build a minimalist productivity tool for solopreneurs that does one thing exceptionally well"

### Idea Types & Approaches

**Project Ideas**
- What would I build/create?
- Requires: Action planning, feasibility check, resource assessment

**Questions**
- What do I wonder about?
- Requires: Research direction, exploration framework

**Insights**
- What have I realized?
- Requires: Connection to existing knowledge, application opportunities

**Observations**
- What did I notice?

## Best Practices

- **Capture immediately** - Don't trust your memory
- **Write in your own words** - Copying isn't thinking
- **One idea per note** - Atomic notes are more connectable
- **Tag generously** - Future-you will thank you
- **Review regularly** - Weekly scan of recent captures
- **Connect actively** - Link related ideas explicitly
- **Develop selectively** - Not every idea deserves elaboration
- **Archive freely** - Not every idea is forever relevant
- **Use consistent tagging** - Build a stable taxonomy over time
- **Date everything** - Context includes when you thought this
- **Include sources** - Ideas have provenance
- **Question your ideas** - "Is this actually true? Why?"
- **Combine ideas** - Novel thinking happens at intersections
- **Make it searchable** - Structure enables retrieval
- **Lower capture friction** - Easy capture = more ideas saved

## Capture Methods

### Physical Capture
- **Notebook**: Always accessible, no batteries
- **Index cards**: One idea per card, easily rearranged
- **Voice memos**: Hands-free capture while moving
- **Photos**: Capture whiteboards, sketches, inspiration

### Digital Capture
- **Note app**: Obsidian, Notion, Apple Notes, etc.
- **Voice-to-text**: Fast dictation
- **Browser extension**: Clip web content
- **Email to inbox**: Send ideas to yourself

### The Capture Moment
**Don't ask**: "Is this worth saving?"
**Do ask**: "Could I forget this?"

If yes → Capture now, judge later

## Idea Development Questions

### For Any Idea

- What problem does this solve?
- Why doesn't this exist already?
- What would make this 10x better?
- Who would care about this?
- What's the simplest version?
- What could go wrong?
- How would I test this?
- What do I need to learn first?

### For Creative Ideas

- What inspired this?
- What's the core insight?
- How could I express this?
- What medium fits best?
- Who is the audience?
- What's the emotional core?

### For Business Ideas

- Who has this problem?
- Would they pay to solve it?
- How would they discover this?
- What's the MVP?
- What's the unfair advantage?
- What metrics would define success?

### For Learning Questions

- What do I already know?
- Where should I start?
- Who are the experts?
- What's the application?
- How will I know I understand?

## Integration Points

This skill works well with:
- **Journal Prompter**: Reflective journaling surfaces ideas
- **Learning Path Creator**: Ideas about what to learn
- **Goal Setter**: Ideas become goals
- **Daily Planner**: Schedule idea development time
- **Reading List Manager**: Reading generates ideas

## Common Idea Capture Mistakes

### Capture Without Context
❌ "That thing Sarah mentioned"
✓ "Sarah's approach to async standups - record video updates instead of meetings"

### Elaborate Capture Systems That Don't Get Used
❌ Complex tagging taxonomy, perfect formatting
✓ Simple, fast capture method you'll actually use

### Capturing But Never Reviewing
❌ 1000 notes, never looked at again
✓ Weekly review process to develop or discard

### Judging Ideas During Capture
❌ "This is probably stupid..."
✓ Capture everything, judge later in review

### No Connections
❌ Isolated notes
✓ Linked ideas create compound insights

## Example Idea Capture Session

**User**: "capture idea"

**Skill Response**:
"Let's get that idea out of your head and into a safe place.

**Quick capture mode:**
Just tell me the idea in whatever form it's in—sentence, paragraph, messy brain dump, whatever. I'll help you structure it after.

What's the idea?"

**User**: "I was thinking about how hard it is to remember what I learn from books. What if there was an app that helped you review highlights over time, like spaced repetition but for book insights?"

**Skill Response**:
"Ooh, that's interesting—applying spaced repetition (proven for language learning) to book retention. There's something there.

Let me capture this properly:

**IDEA**: Spaced repetition app for book highlights/insights

**FULL CONCEPT**:
Books are hard to retain. Spaced repetition works for learning. Combine them: an app that surfaces book highlights/insights over time using spaced repetition algorithms to move insights from short-term to long-term memory.

**TYPE**: This seems like a **[ ] Project idea**

**WHY THIS MATTERS**:
People read but forget most of what they read. This could help retention and application of book knowledge.

**SIMILAR THINGS**:
- Readwise (highlight review)
- Anki (spaced repetition)
- Blinkist (book summaries)

**WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT**:
Combines highlight capture WITH spaced repetition review system.

**NEXT ACTIONS - Which resonates?**
1. **Develop now**: Let's flesh this out into a full project idea
2. **Research first**: Look at existing solutions, validate the problem
3. **Let it marinate**: Save it, come back in a week
4. **Just archive**: Interesting but not pursuing

What feels right?"

**User**: "Let's develop it now"

**Skill Response**:
"Great. Let's take this from idea to actionable concept.

**Development questions:**

**1. The problem**:
You mentioned books are hard to remember. Is this a problem YOU experience personally? Or something you've observed in others?
(Personal problems often make the best product ideas)

**2. Current workarounds**:
What do you do now to try to remember book content? Highlights? Notes? Reviews? What works and what doesn't?

**3. The user**:
Who is this for? Casual readers? Students? Professionals? Everyone?
(Narrower is often better for V1)

**4. The core value**:
If this worked perfectly, what would the user be able to do that they can't do now?

Take these one at a time—they'll sharpen the concept significantly."
