# Campaign Architecture Patterns Skill

## When to Use
- Designing new campaigns across multiple platforms.
- Reorganizing accounts bloated with overlapping audiences or learning-phase resets.
- Planning test cells to isolate variables (audience, creative, bidding).

## Framework
1. **Objective Alignment** – match campaign objective to business KPIs + conversion events.
2. **Hierarchical Testing** – campaign = goal, ad set = audience/bid, ad = creative variant.
3. **Budget Strategy** – CBO vs ABO, pacing guardrails, flighting.
4. **Signal Quality** – ensure each ad set receives enough conversions/week.
5. **Lifecycle Coverage** – separate prospecting, retargeting, and customer expansion streams.

## Templates
- Naming convention guide (Channel_CampaignGoal_Audience_TestID).
- Funnel coverage matrix (stage vs channel vs messaging).
- Test design brief (variable, hypothesis, metric, sample size, duration).

## Tips
- Limit active tests to preserve learning phase stability.
- Centralize exclusions (existing customers, employees, low-LTV segments).
- Archive underperforming structures monthly to maintain account health.
