description: Use when running, operating, or troubleshooting the BeadBoard dashboard and its macOS launchd services — `com.beadboard.dashboard` (Next.js UI on :3000), `com.beadboard.daemon`, install.sh/uninstall.sh, the dashboard HTTP API, the Dolt↔JSONL sync architecture (`export.auto`, the `.beads/issues.jsonl` file-watcher), the `verify-sync.sh` diagnostic, env vars (`BEADS_DOLT_SHARED_SERVER`, `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_PORT`, `BB_AGENT`), service file paths, and the operating/maintenance runbooks. Invoke on "dashboard won't start", "beadboard service", "launchctl beadboard", "is BeadBoard running", "verify-sync", "JSONL drift", "kickstart the dashboard", "EADDRINUSE on 3000". This is the ops/infra layer. For the agent-side coordination contract (the Iron Law, session lifecycle, mail categories, agent states, evidence flow) use `beadboard-driver`; for day-to-day `bd` conventions/troubleshooting use `beads-operations`; for the shared Dolt server internals use `working-with-dolt`.

# BeadBoard operations

The **ops / infrastructure** layer for [BeadBoard](https://github.com/jordanhindo/beadboard) — how it runs as always-on macOS launchd services on Joe's machine. This skill mirrors the docs from the [beadboard-ops](https://github.com/joeblackwaslike/beadboard-ops) repo (the operational glue: launchd units, install/uninstall scripts, and driver-skill wiring; it does not fork BeadBoard itself).

> **Two layers, two skills.** BeadBoard splits cleanly:
> - **Agent coordination contract** (the Iron Law, the 9-step session lifecycle, mail categories, agent states, evidence) → the **`beadboard-driver`** skill. *This skill does not duplicate it.*
> - **Operations / infrastructure** (services, dashboard, daemon, Dolt↔JSONL sync, diagnostics, runbooks) → **this skill.**

## What beadboard-ops manages

| Unit | What | Logs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `com.beadboard.dashboard` | Next.js 15 dashboard on `:3000` (KeepAlive, auto-restart) | `/tmp/beadboard-dashboard.{log,err}` |
| `com.beadboard.daemon` | Execution daemon (RunAtLoad one-shot, forward-compatible stub) | `/tmp/beadboard-daemon.{log,err}` |
| `com.beads.shared-dolt-server` | Shared Dolt SQL server on `:3308` (managed separately) | `~/.beads/shared-server/dolt-server.log` |

## Quick health check

```bash
launchctl list | grep beadboard                                  # 2 units, exit code 0
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://localhost:3000   # -> 200
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.beadboard.dashboard      # force-restart dashboard
tail -f /tmp/beadboard-dashboard.err                             # dashboard boot errors
./bin/verify-sync.sh                                             # audit Dolt <-> JSONL across all projects
bd config get export.auto | grep -q true || bd config set export.auto true   # per-project: ensure JSONL auto-export is ON
```

> **Stale dashboard? Check `export.auto` first.** The dashboard reads each project's
> `.beads/issues.jsonl`, which `bd` only refreshes automatically when **`export.auto=true`** (it is
> **`false` by default** in every fresh `bd init`). A project showing stale data on the board almost
> always has `export.auto` off — run `bd config set export.auto true` in that repo (then `bd export`
> to refresh now). This was the root cause of JSONL drift across all of Joe's repos. The per-`bd`-project
> setup convention lives in `beads-operations`; this is the dashboard-side symptom of getting it wrong.
