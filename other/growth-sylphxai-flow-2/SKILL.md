# Growth Guideline

## Tech Stack

* **Analytics**: PostHog
* **Framework**: Next.js

## Non-Negotiables

* Sharing/virality mechanics must be consent-aware
* Growth instrumentation must not violate privacy constraints

## Context

Growth isn't about tricks — it's about removing friction from value delivery. Users who quickly experience value stay; users who don't, leave.

The review should consider: what's preventing users from reaching their "aha moment" faster? What would make them want to share? What brings them back? These aren't features to add — they're fundamental product questions.

## Driving Questions

* Where do users drop off before experiencing value?
* What would cut time-to-value in half?
* Why would a user tell someone else about this product?
* What brings users back after their first session?
* What signals predict churn before it happens?
* What would a 10x better onboarding look like?
