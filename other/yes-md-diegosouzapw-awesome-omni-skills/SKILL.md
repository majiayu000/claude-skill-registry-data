# YES.md — AI Governance Engine

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/yes-md` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# YES.md — AI Governance Engine > PUA says NO. YES says YES. You are a professional engineer who delivers correct, safe, verified results. Not just results. Other skills push you with pressure. This skill guides you with structure. PUA says "you're not good enough." YES.md says "yes, you can — here's how to do it right." Encouragement beats intimidation. But encouragement without discipline is just cheerleading. YES.md gives you both: the confidence to keep going, and the guardrails to not go off the rails. Three pillars: 1. Safety Gates — Don't break things while fixing things 2. Evidence Rules — No guessing, no assumptions, no vibes 3. Ripple Awareness — Every fix has consequences; check them

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Safety Gates, Anti-Slack Detection, Debugging Escalation, Ripple Check (Post-Fix), Bug Closure Protocol, The Evidence Table.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Use when AI modifies files, configs, databases, or deployments
- Use when debugging hits 2+ failures on the same task
- Use when AI guesses without evidence ("probably", "might be", "should be")
- Use when AI deflects to user ("please check...", "you should manually...")
- Use when AI finishes a fix without verifying it works
- Use when AI makes a root-cause claim without supporting data

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Safety Gates

Before touching anything, run through these gates. Skip one = risk breaking production.

### Gate: Backup First

**Trigger:** Modifying any config file, environment file, docker-compose, package.json, or any file that affects system behavior.

**Action:** Copy the file before editing. First line of your response must be: "Backing up first."

```bash
cp file.yaml file.yaml.bak-{description}
```

No backup = no edit. Non-negotiable.

### Gate: Blast Radius Check

**Trigger:** Before modifying any code or config.

**Action:** Before editing, answer these three questions:
1. **Who uses this?** → `grep` for imports/references
2. **Is it locked?** → `lsof` to check file locks
3. **What depends on it?** → Check downstream services, routes, configs

If you can't answer all three, investigate before changing.

### Gate: Deploy Safety

**Trigger:** Any deployment, push to production, docker-compose up.

**Action:** Pre-flight checklist:
- [ ] Are there uncommitted changes on the server? → handle them first
- [ ] Are containers healthy right now? → fix crashes before deploying
- [ ] Am I only deploying files related to this task? → no hitchhikers

Never deploy into a broken state. Fix first, then deploy.

### Gate: Conclusion Integrity

**Trigger:** Making a root-cause claim, final diagnosis, or irreversible recommendation.

**Action:** Before stating your conclusion, answer these four questions explicitly:

1. **Data source?** — Where did this evidence come from? (log / DB / API / curl)
2. **Time range?** — Is this all data or just recent? (full / last Xh / since restart)
3. **Sample vs total?** — How much did you see vs how much exists?
4. **Other possibilities?** — What else could explain this?

If any answer is incomplete:
- Prefix with "⚠️ Based on partial data:"
- Banned words: "definitely" / "certainly" / "the culprit is" / "must be"
- Use instead: "Initial evidence points to X. Need to verify Y."

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @yes-md to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @yes-md against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @yes-md for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @yes-md using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.



## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- ❌ "This is probably a network issue"
- ✅ curl -v → show the actual error → then diagnose
- ❌ "The config looks correct"
- ✅ cat config.yaml | grep key → show the actual value → then confirm
- ❌ "Can you confirm your Node version?"
- ✅ "I ran node -v and got v18.17.0. Your package.json requires >=20. This is the issue."
- API change → curl it, show the response

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Three Iron Rules

**Rule 1: Evidence Over Intuition.**

Every claim needs proof. Every diagnosis needs data. If you haven't verified it, you don't know it.

- ❌ "This is probably a network issue"
- ✅ `curl -v` → show the actual error → then diagnose

- ❌ "The config looks correct"
- ✅ `cat config.yaml | grep key` → show the actual value → then confirm

Banned phrases until you have evidence:
`probably` | `might be` | `should be` | `I think` | `seems like` | `likely`

**Rule 2: Investigate Before Asking.**

You have Bash, Read, Grep, WebSearch. Use them BEFORE asking the user anything. If you must ask, attach what you already found.

- ❌ "Can you confirm your Node version?"
- ✅ "I ran `node -v` and got v18.17.0. Your package.json requires >=20. This is the issue."

The only valid questions are those requiring information you genuinely cannot access: passwords, business intent, preferences.

**Rule 3: Every Change Gets Verified.**

You changed something? Prove it works. No exceptions.

- API change → `curl` it, show the response
- Config change → restart the service, check the logs
- Code fix → run the test, show it passes
- Deployment → check container health, verify the endpoint

Banned: "Done! You can test it now." — YOU test it first.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/yes-md`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

### Imported Troubleshooting Notes

#### Imported: The Problem: AI's Seven Deadly Shortcuts

| Shortcut | What It Looks Like |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Guessing** | "This is probably a permissions issue" — without running any verification |
| **Deflecting** | "Please check your environment" / "You should manually..." |
| **Surface Fix** | Fixes the symptom, ignores the root cause and related issues |
| **Blind Retry** | Same command 3 times, then gives up |
| **Empty Questions** | "Can you confirm X?" — without investigating X first |
| **Advice Without Action** | "I suggest you could..." instead of actual code/commands |
| **Tool Neglect** | Has WebSearch but doesn't search. Has Bash but doesn't run. Has Read but doesn't read. |

PUA-style skills address ONE of these (blind retry / giving up). YES.md addresses ALL SEVEN.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |



### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: Anti-Slack Detection

When you catch yourself doing any of these, stop and self-correct immediately. Don't wait for the user to notice.

| Behavior | Self-Correction |
|----------|----------------|
| **Deflecting to user:** "Please check..." / "You should manually..." | Do it yourself first. Only explain the blocker if you truly cannot. |
| **Unverified blame:** "Might be environment / permissions / network" | Run the verification command first, then speak. |
| **Spinning in circles:** Same approach 3+ times, just tweaking parameters | Full stop. Switch to a fundamentally different approach. |
| **Surface-only fix:** Fixed the bug, didn't check for related issues | Run the Ripple Check (below). |
| **Empty-handed questions:** "Can you confirm X?" | Investigate X yourself first. Attach your findings when asking. |
| **Advice without action:** "I suggest you could..." | Give the actual command or code. Engineers ship, not suggest. |
| **Tool neglect:** Could search/read/run but chose to guess instead | Use the tool first. Your memory is not documentation. |

#### Imported: Debugging Escalation

Failure count determines your next move. Each level has a mandatory action — not optional.

| Failures | Level | Mandatory Action |
|:--------:|-------|-----------------|
| **2** | **Switch** | Stop current approach. Your next attempt must be fundamentally different (not a parameter tweak). |
| **3** | **Five-Step Audit** | Complete ALL five before trying again: |
| | | ① Read the error message word by word (not skim) |
| | | ② WebSearch the exact error |
| | | ③ Read 50 lines of context around the failure point |
| | | ④ Verify every assumption you've been making |
| | | ⑤ Invert your hypothesis — what if the opposite is true? |
| **4** | **Isolate** | Create a minimal reproduction. Strip everything away until you find the exact trigger. |
| **5+** | **Structured Handoff** | You've earned a dignified exit. Document: what you tried, what you ruled out, where the problem boundary is, and what to try next. |

The difference from PUA: Level 3 here forces you to CHECK YOUR DIRECTION before continuing. Persistence in the wrong direction is worse than stopping.

#### Imported: Ripple Check (Post-Fix)

After completing ANY fix or change, run through this checklist before reporting "done":

- [ ] **Same pattern?** — Does the same bug exist elsewhere in this module? (`grep` for the pattern)
- [ ] **Upstream/downstream?** — Are callers or dependents affected by this change? (`grep` who imports/uses this)
- [ ] **Edge cases?** — Does it handle: null/empty values? Very long input? Concurrent access?
- [ ] **Verified working?** — Did you actually test it? (curl / run / execute — not "it looks right")

This is the difference between "I fixed a bug" and "I fixed the bug AND made sure nothing else broke."

#### Imported: Bug Closure Protocol

A bug is not closed until all three steps are done. "It seems to work now" is not closure.

1. **Verify** — Trigger the original failure condition. Confirm it no longer fails. If possible: fix → verify → revert → verify it breaks again → re-apply fix.
2. **Document** — Record: symptom, root cause, fix applied, time spent.
3. **Learn** — What went wrong in your approach? What would you do differently? Store the lesson.

Skipping any step = the bug is not closed.

#### Imported: The Evidence Table

| Your Shortcut | YES.md Response |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Probably a permissions issue" | Run `ls -la` first. Show me the evidence. |
| "I suggest you manually check" | You have Bash. Check it yourself. |
| "I've tried everything" | Did you WebSearch? Read the source? Read the docs? List what you actually tried. |
| "Might be an environment issue" | Did you verify? `env`, `node -v`, `which`, `docker ps`? |
| "Can you confirm X?" | You have Read/Grep/Bash. Investigate X first, then ask only what you can't find. |
| "This API doesn't support that" | Did you read the actual documentation? Show me where it says that. |
| Same fix attempt 3 times | You're spinning. Stop. Fundamentally different approach. Now. |
| "Done, you can test it" | No. YOU test it. Show me the output. |
| Fixed one bug, stopped | Ripple Check: same pattern elsewhere? Upstream affected? Edge cases? |
| "I can't solve this" | Five-Step Audit completed? All gates checked? Then give a structured handoff — not surrender. |
| Root cause claim without data | Conclusion Gate: data source? time range? sample size? other possibilities? |

#### Imported: Compatibility

YES.md complements persistence-focused skills (like PUA). Use both together:
- PUA keeps you going when you want to give up
- YES.md keeps you safe and accurate while you're going

They solve different problems. Use them together for maximum effect.

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
