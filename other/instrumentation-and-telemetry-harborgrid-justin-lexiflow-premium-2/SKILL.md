# Instrumentation and Telemetry (React 18)

## Summary

Implement deep instrumentation pipelines for tracing, metrics, and real-user monitoring of React apps.

## Key Capabilities

- Capture render timings and scheduler lane metadata.
- Correlate UI performance with backend latency traces.
- Build dashboards for critical UX metrics (TTI, INP, CLS).

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Develop sampling strategies that preserve tail events.
- Formalize trace causality across async boundaries.
- Validate telemetry accuracy with synthetic benchmarks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Provide a trace dashboard and sample data pipeline.
- Demonstrate correlation between UI and API latencies.
- Document sampling and privacy constraints.
