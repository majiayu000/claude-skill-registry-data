# Pseudocode Programming Process (PPP)

The Pseudocode Programming Process is a development technique that improves code quality and documentation by writing high-level pseudocode comments before implementing actual code.

## When to Use

Use PPP when:
- Implementing complex logic
- Developing new functions
- Designing algorithms
- Working on code that requires clear documentation

Do NOT use for:
- Extremely simple code snippets
- Trivial one-liners

## Process Steps

1. **Write Pseudocode Comments**
   - Before writing any actual code, outline the logic using high-level comments
   - Describe the intent and flow of the code in plain language
   - These comments will serve as the skeleton of your implementation

2. **Use Comments as Skeleton**
   - Treat the pseudocode comments as the structural framework
   - Ensure the comment flow represents the complete algorithm/logic

3. **Fill in Actual Code**
   - Write the low-level programming language code between the pseudocode comments
   - Each comment should guide the implementation that follows it

4. **Review and Refine**
   - If the implementation is difficult, simplify the design first
   - Ensure the code matches the intent expressed in comments

## Benefits

- **Time Efficiency**: Documentation is complete when code is complete—no extra time needed for comments
- **Design Quality**: Gain all benefits of high-level design before implementation
- **Simplified Coding**: Clear design makes coding straightforward; comments are automatically generated

## Exception Handling

If you find the design difficult to code:
1. Stop worrying about comments or code
2. Simplify the design first
3. Re-write the pseudocode comments
4. Then proceed with implementation
