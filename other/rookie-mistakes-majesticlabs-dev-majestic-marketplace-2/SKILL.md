# Rookie Mistakes

Common mistakes by business type that delay revenue or kill businesses.

## Universal Fatal Mistakes

| Mistake | Why Fatal | Instead |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Building before validating | Months wasted on unwanted product | Pre-sell or LOIs first |
| Underpricing | Can't sustain business | Start high, discount later |
| No niche focus | Can't compete with anyone | Dominate one segment first |
| Perfecting before launching | Never launch | Ship MVP, iterate |
| Ignoring unit economics | Lose money on every sale | Know CAC < LTV from day 1 |

## Universal Time Wasters

| Mistake | Time Lost | Instead |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Logo/branding first | 2-4 weeks | Use Canva, good enough |
| Custom website | 3-6 weeks | Use Carrd, Webflow template |
| Fancy tools | 1-2 weeks setup | Spreadsheet + free tools |
| Social media posting | 10+ hrs/week | Direct outreach to buyers |
| Networking events | Days | Cold outreach to ICP |

## By Business Type

### Consulting/Services

**Fatal:**
- Hourly billing instead of value-based → Capped income, commodity positioning
- No scope boundaries → Scope creep destroys margins
- One big client → Vulnerable to churn

**Expensive:**
- Expensive office → Work from home/cowork
- Hiring too early → Stay solo to $200K+

**Time wasters:**
- Long proposals → One-page with call
- Unpaid strategy sessions → Paid discovery calls

### SaaS/Software

**Fatal:**
- Building for 6+ months before launch → Ship in 6 weeks or less
- Feature parity with competitors → Unique wedge feature only
- No activation metrics → Users sign up but never return

**Expensive:**
- Overbuilt infrastructure → Start on Heroku/Vercel
- Paid ads before PMF → Manual sales first

**Time wasters:**
- Perfect design → Functional first
- Supporting every browser/platform → Chrome only initially

### E-commerce

**Fatal:**
- Large inventory before validation → Dropship or small batch first
- Competing on price with Amazon → Unique products only
- No repeat purchase strategy → Consumables or loyalty

**Expensive:**
- Paid traffic before funnel optimization → Organic/influencer first
- Expensive photography → iPhone + good lighting

**Time wasters:**
- 100 SKUs at launch → Start with 5-10 heroes
- Complex fulfillment → Use 3PL from day 1

### Agency

**Fatal:**
- Taking any client → ICP focus from day 1
- Billing hourly → Productized services
- No referral system → Build in from start

**Expensive:**
- Hiring before systems → Document before delegating
- Expensive tools → Free tiers exist

**Time wasters:**
- Custom everything → Templatize deliverables
- Long sales cycles → Productize to shorten

### Local Services

**Fatal:**
- No reviews strategy → Ask every customer
- Underpricing to compete → Compete on quality/service
- No recurring revenue → Maintenance plans

**Expensive:**
- Vehicle wraps too early → Magnetic signs
- Prime location → Start home-based

**Time wasters:**
- Broad service area → Dense local focus
- All services at once → Master one first

## Recovery Patterns

If already made the mistake:

| Mistake | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| Built wrong thing | Pivot to what users actually use |
| Underpriced | Grandfather old, new price forward |
| Wrong niche | Double down on best segment |
| One big client | Immediately prospect for 2-3 more |
| Hired too fast | Cut fast, don't delay |
