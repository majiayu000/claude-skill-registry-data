# Observability for React Concurrency (React 18)

## Summary

Implement advanced observability to capture concurrent rendering behavior and scheduling anomalies.

## Key Capabilities

- Trace concurrent render events with lane metadata.
- Correlate UI traces with backend spans.
- Detect scheduling anomalies and alert on regressions.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Formalize anomaly detection for concurrent schedules.
- Optimize sampling without losing tail-event fidelity.
- Validate observability accuracy under load.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Provide a trace schema and sample dashboards.
- Demonstrate detection of a concurrency anomaly.
- Document sampling strategy and trade-offs.
