# YouTube Script Writing

Transform disorganized ideas into retention-optimized scripts through a checkpoint-based workflow.

## Core Psychology

All great scripts operate on one principle: **Reality must beat expectations.**

- Viewer expectations = what they think will happen based on title/thumbnail
- Reality = what you actually deliver in the video
- When reality > expectations → satisfaction, engagement, shares
- When reality < expectations → disappointment, drop-off, bounce

Every decision in scriptwriting serves this gap.

## The Workflow

Work through these checkpoints in order. Each builds on the previous.

### Checkpoint 1: Define the Foundation

Before writing anything:

1. **Target audience**: Who specifically is watching? What do they already know?
2. **Desired emotion**: Pick ONE primary emotion to transfer:
   - Awe/inspiration
   - Amusement/humor
   - Excitement/joy
   - Anger/outrage
   - Surprise/shock/curiosity
   - Sadness/empathy
3. **Core promise**: One sentence describing what viewer gets from watching

### Checkpoint 2: Research & Mine for Shock

Find the facts that will beat expectations. See [references/research.md](references/research.md).

**Shock Score Method**: Rate each fact 1-100 based on "How many viewers would NOT know this?"
- 80+ = Gold (most viewers surprised)
- 50-79 = Good supporting points
- Below 50 = Skip unless essential context

Collect 5-10 high-shock facts before proceeding.

### Checkpoint 3: Write the Hook

The hook confirms the click and opens a curiosity loop. See [references/hooks.md](references/hooks.md) for the 9 proven formats.

**Quick Formula** (works for any niche):
- **Target**: Who is this for?
- **Transformation**: What will they gain?
- **Stakes**: What happens if they don't watch?

**Hook Commandments** (verify all 4):
1. Alignment: Visual, spoken, and text hooks match
2. Speed: Value promised in first 3 seconds
3. Clarity: Topic is unmistakable
4. Curiosity: Opens a question they must answer

### Checkpoint 4: Choose Story Structure & Outline

Pick ONE structure that fits your content. See [references/structures.md](references/structures.md) for all 7 formats.

**Most Common Structures**:
- **Tutorial**: Step-by-step process → Hook → Steps → Outro
- **Listicle**: Ordered items → Hook → List → Outro
- **Problem-Solver**: Pain → Solution → Hook → Problem → Solution → Outro
- **Case Study**: How X achieved Y → Hook → Framework → Outro

Create a bullet outline BEFORE writing. Sequence your shock facts logically.

### Checkpoint 5: Write the Body

For each section, use the **Value Loop**:
1. **Context**: What is it? (Simple, clear)
2. **Application**: How to use it? (Examples)
3. **Framing**: Why does it matter? (Connect to bigger picture)

**Retention Techniques** (see [references/retention.md](references/retention.md)):
- **Rehooks**: Every 30-60 seconds, reagitate the promise ("But here's where it gets interesting...")
- **Setups & Payoffs**: Tease information, delay reveal, then deliver
- **Second-best first**: Put your second-best point first, best point second (creates ascending pattern)

### Checkpoint 6: Edit for Quality

Run three audits on your draft. See [references/editing.md](references/editing.md).

**1. Story Flow Audit**
- Read each line: Is this necessary or a tangent?
- Delete anything that breaks the through-line
- Test: Can viewer follow beginning to end without getting lost?

**2. Comprehension Audit**
- Target 6th grade vocabulary
- Shorter sentences (staccato, not run-on)
- Active voice ("The dog jumped" not "The jumping was done by the dog")
- Restate complex ideas twice, second time simpler

**3. Speed-to-Value Audit**
- Is value signaled in first 3 seconds?
- Rehooks every 30-60 seconds?
- Outro summarizes or extends value?

### Checkpoint 7: Outro & CTA

**Binge Loop Formula** (last 15-30 seconds):
1. Link back to video content naturally
2. Introduce a NEW problem/question
3. Promise to solve it in another video or resource

## Quick Reference: Script Template

```
HOOK (0-15 seconds)
- Confirm the click
- Open curiosity loop
- Establish credibility (optional)

BODY SECTION 1 (Rehook → Content → Payoff)
[Second-best point]

BODY SECTION 2 (Rehook → Content → Payoff)
[Best point]

BODY SECTION 3+ (Rehook → Content → Payoff)
[Remaining points in descending order]

OUTRO (Last 15-30 seconds)
- Summarize value delivered
- Binge loop to next video/resource
```

## When to Use Each Reference

- **Starting from scratch with no topic?** → [references/research.md](references/research.md)
- **Stuck on how to start the video?** → [references/hooks.md](references/hooks.md)
- **Don't know how to organize points?** → [references/structures.md](references/structures.md)
- **Retention dropping mid-video?** → [references/retention.md](references/retention.md)
- **Script feels clunky or confusing?** → [references/editing.md](references/editing.md)
