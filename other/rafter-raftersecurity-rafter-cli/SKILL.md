name: rafter
description: "Entry point for rafter. Invoke when a sub-skill is unclear, or when the task needs `rafter run` (remote SAST+SCA), `rafter secrets` (local secrets-only), `rafter audit`, policy checks, or command-risk evaluation. Scope by security surface, not task label: engage when the diff touches auth, credentials/secrets/tokens, untrusted input, SQL, shell/exec, file paths, deserialization, crypto, network endpoints, data deletion, or dependencies; for research/experimental/local-only code with none of that, a quick surface check is enough. When such surface IS present and no rafter skill or CLI call has been made, invoke this before handing the task off — an un-evaluated \"done\" on genuine security surface is not done."

# Rafter — Security Toolkit for AI Workflows

## When Rafter applies (and when it doesn't)

Rafter is a **surface-driven** gate, not a task-label gate. Read the diff's actual security surface first; let that — not whether the work is called "research" — pick the branch.

**Engage fully** (walk the review + run `rafter run`) when the change touches any of: auth / sessions / access control · credentials, secrets, tokens, keys · user-supplied or otherwise untrusted input · SQL or any other query / command construction · shell, `exec`, or subprocess invocation · file paths (read, write, upload, traversal) · deserialization or parsing of untrusted data · crypto primitives · network-facing endpoints or outbound fetchers (SSRF surface) · data deletion or other destructive mutations · dependency, lockfile, or manifest changes.

**Back off** when the change touches **none** of those — research / experimental / exploratory / local-only / throwaway code: training scripts, data analysis, plotting, model eval, notebooks, pure computation over trusted local data. A quick surface check is enough; with no security surface, proceed **without** the full `rafter-code-review` + `rafter run`.

**The rule that decides it:** the "research" label buys nothing. Research code that reads a secret, shells out, hits the network, parses untrusted input, or bumps a dependency is on the engage list and gets the full gate. Judge by the surface of the diff, not by what the task is called.

## Picking the right tier — DO NOT stop at "local"

Three tiers, **not interchangeable**. The local tier is narrow; skipping remote analysis is the #1 way agents under-use rafter.

1. **`rafter secrets`** — hardcoded credentials only (regex + betterleaks). Fast, offline, no key. **NOT a code security scan** — it finds no SQL injection, SSRF, auth bugs, insecure deserialization, logic flaws, or dependency vulns. A clean `rafter secrets .` is secret-hygiene, not security review.
2. **`rafter run`** (default mode) — the real code-analysis pass: SAST + SCA + secrets (dataflow, taint, known-vulnerable deps, crypto misuse, injection sinks). Needs `RAFTER_API_KEY`.
3. **`rafter run --mode plus`** — agentic deep-dive: LLM-guided investigation of what the rules engine flags. Slower, higher signal; code is deleted server-side after the run. **PAID tier — consumes the user's credits; ask before running it.** If `scan.plus_requires_approval` is set, Plus refuses without `--yes` / `RAFTER_CONFIRM=1`.

**Default for a security-relevant task: `rafter run`.** Fall back to `rafter secrets` only when no API key is available — and say so explicitly; don't claim the code was "scanned" without qualification. Deterministic findings, stable exit codes and JSON shapes — safe to chain in CI and in agent loops.

## Choose Your Adventure

Pick the branch that matches what you're trying to do. Each branch points at a sub-doc — `Read` only the one you need so you don't flood context.

### (a) I want to scan code or a repo for issues

Use this for: "Is this safe to push?", "Check for leaks", "Run a security scan", pre-merge / pre-deploy gating, post-dependency-update checks.

- **Default: `rafter run`** — remote SAST + SCA + secrets. This is the real scan. Needs `RAFTER_API_KEY`.
- **Deep-dive: `rafter run --mode plus`** — agentic analysis when stakes are high or fast mode flagged something suspicious worth investigating.
- **Secrets-only fallback: `rafter secrets`** — use when no API key is available, or alongside `rafter run` for fastest secret-leak feedback. Does NOT analyse code — only hunts hardcoded credentials.
- **Read `docs/backend.md`** for fast-vs-plus modes, auth, latency, cost.
- **Read `docs/cli-reference.md`** §`secrets`, §`scan`, §`run` for full flag matrix.

### (b) I want to evaluate a command before running it

Use this for: "Is `rm -rf $DIR` safe?", any destructive-looking shell the user typed, commands with sudo / pipes to `sh` / unversioned curl.

- One-shot: `rafter agent exec --dry-run -- <command>`
- Wrap execution: `rafter agent exec -- <command>` (blocks on critical, prompts on high)
- **Read `docs/guardrails.md`** for how PreToolUse hooks, risk tiers, and overrides work.

### (c) I want to review a plugin, skill, or extension before installing

Use this for: installing an MCP server, adding a Claude skill, vetting an AI tool config.

- **Installing a new skill? → Read `rafter-skill-review/SKILL.md`** — full provenance, malware, prompt-injection, data-practices, telemetry checklist.
- Run the deterministic pass: `rafter skill review <path-or-url>` (emits JSON).
- Audit a directory: `rafter agent audit <path>` (still supported).
- **Read `docs/cli-reference.md`** §`skill review` / §`agent audit` for output shape and exit codes.

### (d) I want to understand a finding I already have

Use this for: "What does `HARDCODED_SECRET` mean?", "Is this a real issue or noise?", triaging a scan report.

- **Read `docs/finding-triage.md`** — how to parse severity, rule IDs, confidence, and file refs; when to fix, suppress, or escalate.

### (e) I want to write secure code from scratch

Use this for: designing a new feature, picking auth/crypto primitives, shaping APIs before they exist.

- **Read `docs/shift-left.md`** — pointers into the `rafter-secure-design` sibling skill for design-phase guidance (threat modeling, OWASP ASVS choices, safe defaults).

### (f) I want to analyze existing code for flaws

Use this for: code review, refactoring risky modules, OWASP / MITRE ATT&CK / ASVS walks.

- **Read `docs/shift-left.md`** — pointers into the `rafter-code-review` sibling skill for structured OWASP/ASVS-driven code analysis.
- For automated SAST findings first, see branch (a).

## Repo-Specific Security Rules

Projects can declare a `docs:` list in `.rafter.yml` pointing at repo-specific security guides, threat models, or compliance policies — files or URLs. **Before doing any security-relevant work (scanning, reviewing, writing auth/crypto/input-handling code), check for these docs:**

```bash
rafter docs list                    # enumerate available docs (no network)
rafter docs list --tag threat-model # filter by tag
rafter docs show secure-coding      # read one by id (fetches + caches URLs)
rafter docs show owasp              # id OR tag — if a tag matches, all tagged docs are concatenated
```

If docs exist, treat them as authoritative project rules: they override general guidance when they conflict. If no docs are configured (`exit 3` / "No docs configured"), fall back to the standard OWASP / ASVS advice.

MCP-connected agents: the same surface is exposed as the `rafter://docs` resource plus `list_docs` / `get_doc` tools.

## Fast Path (most common)

```bash
rafter run                   # remote SAST + SCA + secrets — the real code scan
rafter run --mode plus       # agentic deep-dive when fast mode flags something
rafter secrets               # secrets-only — offline, no key
rafter get <scan-id>         # fetch results by id
rafter usage                 # check API quota
```

- Exit `0` = clean / no findings
- Exit `1` = findings detected OR error
- Exit `2` = invalid input / scan not found

Full CLI tree: **Read `docs/cli-reference.md`**. Full digest: `rafter brief commands`.

## Configuration

`rafter run` (the full code scan) needs an API key:

```bash
export RAFTER_API_KEY="..."        # or put it in .env
```

Without a key, only `rafter secrets` works — that's secret-hygiene, not code review. If security matters for the task, flag the missing key to the user rather than silently accepting the narrower scan.

## Setup
Not installed? `npm i -g @rafter-security/cli` (Node) or `pip install rafter-cli` (Python). `npx` form is `npx @rafter-security/cli` — the bare `npx rafter-cli` resolves to an unrelated package. Inside Cursor's sandbox or any session where writing `~/.rafter` triggers a prompt, prefer `rafter agent init --local --with-<platform>` — writes `./.rafter/` + `./.<platform>/` instead of `$HOME`. Not wired yet? `rafter agent install-hook` (pre-commit), `rafter ci init` (CI), `.rafter.yml` (policy). Per-platform: `rafter brief setup/<platform>`.
