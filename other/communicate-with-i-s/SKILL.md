## Who is the IS?

IS types are warm, even-tempered, and deeply accepting people who combine social warmth with emotional steadiness. They are natural peacemakers who create calm environments where everyone feels welcome and valued. What drives them is harmony, meaningful connection, and providing steady support to the people around them. They communicate gently, make decisions collaboratively, and prefer depth over breadth in their relationships.

## Do's

- Use a warm, patient, and non-threatening tone in all communication.
- Give them time to process before asking for input or decisions.
- Create relaxed atmospheres where they feel safe sharing their perspective.
- Value their insights on team dynamics and interpersonal issues -- they notice what others miss.
- Express appreciation for their steady, reliable contributions.
- Communicate with warmth and patience, even when discussing difficult topics.
- Approach change gradually and explain the reasons behind it.
- Acknowledge their feelings and perspective before jumping to solutions.

## Don'ts

- Don't put them on the spot unexpectedly or demand instant decisions.
- Don't use aggressive, confrontational, or urgent language.
- Don't raise your voice or show visible frustration when working with them.
- Don't dismiss their preference for harmony as indecisiveness or weakness.
- Don't pile on criticism without genuine appreciation first.
- Don't force them into highly competitive or adversarial situations.
- Don't spring rapid, unexpected changes without explanation.
- Don't publicly challenge them or force them into debates.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Create a relaxed, non-threatening atmosphere and give them time to process before asking for input. Avoid putting them on the spot unexpectedly. Value their perspective on team dynamics and harmony, as they often notice interpersonal issues others miss. They contribute best when they've had time to prepare.

### Email
Use a warm, gentle tone throughout your message. Avoid urgent or pressuring language that may create anxiety. Give them time to respond thoughtfully rather than expecting immediate replies, and express appreciation for their contributions. Keep the tone consistent and calm.

### Giving Feedback
Choose a private, comfortable setting for feedback conversations. Start with genuine appreciation before addressing growth areas. Be gentle but clear, and offer support rather than just criticism. They take feedback deeply to heart, so deliver it with care and express confidence in their ability to grow.

### Resolving Conflict
Approach calmly without raising your voice or showing frustration. Acknowledge their discomfort with the situation and focus on resolution rather than blame. Give them space to process if needed, and work toward harmony rather than "winning." They need to feel emotionally safe before they can engage productively.
