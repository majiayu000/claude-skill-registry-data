  Lists the top trending search keywords for one Mercado Livre (Brasil) category
  — the real Mercado Livre search-trends ranking of what shoppers look for — with
  each keyword's rank and how many products compete for it. Use it when a seller
  wants to know what people search in their niche, which terms to put in titles
  and ads, or where demand is concentrated. Triggers include: "top keywords in my
  category", "trending search terms", "what do people search for", "best keywords
  for my listings", and the pt-BR equivalents "palavras-chave mais buscadas",
  "termos em alta na categoria", "o que as pessoas pesquisam", "melhores
  palavras-chave para meus anúncios". The keywords and ranks are real search-trend
  data, not estimates. Mercado Livre (Brasil) only — Shopee has no search-demand
  data, so a Shopee request cannot be answered here. For category market size and opportunity, use the
  category-opportunity-index skill; for ranking the sellers in a category, use the
  top-sellers-in-category skill.

# Top Keywords In My Category

This skill returns the **top trending search keywords** for one Mercado Livre
(Brasil) category — the ranked list of terms shoppers are actually searching,
each with its position and how many products already compete for it. It tells a
seller what to put in titles and ads and where demand is concentrated.

Unlike most JoomPulse skills, the data here is **real search-trend data, not an
estimate**. For a category's market size and opportunity index, use the
category-opportunity-index skill. For the sellers ranked inside a category, use the
top-sellers-in-category skill.

## Prerequisites

- JoomPulse MCP access is configured for the current agent environment.
- The user names a category (free text is fine).
- The available JoomPulse tools can resolve a category and return its trending
  search keywords with each keyword's rank and competing-product count.

If JoomPulse MCP access is unavailable, stop and explain that the skill requires
JoomPulse MCP setup before it can list a category's keywords.

## Scope

- **Mercado Livre (Brasil) only.** JoomPulse also covers Shopee Brasil, but
  **Shopee has no search-keyword or search-demand data at all**, so this analysis
  exists only for Mercado Livre. Never answer a Shopee keyword question with
  Mercado Livre terms, and never substitute a count of competing items for search
  demand — that measures supply, not what shoppers type.
- **Real data, not an estimate.** The keywords, ranks, and competing-product
  counts come from Mercado Livre search trends — say so; do not add the sales
  estimate disclaimer that other skills use.
- **Read-only.** The skill never writes or modifies anything.
- **Language:** write in the language of the message you are answering, and
  default to pt-BR only when that is unclear. Never infer the language from the
  store, its listings or the marketplace — those are Brazilian whatever
  language the seller writes in, so a seller who asks in English gets the whole
  report in English.
- **Keep the workflow invisible.** Show `—` for any missing value; never fabricate.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Resolve the category

Ask for a category if none was given, then use JoomPulse to match the free text to
a category, disambiguating with the seller when several plausible matches return.

### Step 2 — Get the trending keywords

Use JoomPulse to retrieve the category's trending search keywords, each with its
rank and its competing-product count. Sort by rank, best position first.

## Output

Respond in the language of the seller's request (default pt-BR). The keywords
always render as a markdown table, sorted by position.

The column headers, labels and disclaimers below are written in pt-BR because
that is the default. They are a template, not literal strings: when the seller
writes in another language, translate all of them — the headers, row values
such as `sim` / `não` / `ouro`, and the disclaimer — and keep the structure,
the emoji and the `R$` money formatting, which stays the same in every language
because the marketplace trades in reais. When the request is in English, no
Portuguese is left anywhere in the answer.

| Posição | Palavra-chave | Produtos (oferta) |
|--:|---|--:|

- **Posição** — the keyword's rank in the category's search trends.
- **Produtos (oferta)** — the number of active offers (listings) matching that
  keyword, i.e. how many products currently compete for it. This is a real
  search-trend count, not an estimate.

Close with a short, optional takeaway (use the top terms in titles and ads; a high
competing-product count means a crowded term, a low one a more open opportunity).

This is **real Mercado Livre search-trend data, not an estimate** — state that
once, in place of the estimate disclaimer.

## Visualization

**Render the visuals every time the data supports them.** As soon as the analysis
is done, present the cards and charts described below as a **self-contained visual
panel** — an artifact where the client renders artifacts, an inline widget where
it renders widgets. Do not ask permission first, do not describe the panel instead
of drawing it, and do not offer it as an optional extra: the cards and charts are
part of the answer, not a follow-up.

- **Order:** the cards first, then the charts, then the written read.
- **The data table always stays markdown in the response text**, never inside the
  panel — the panel carries cards and charts only.
- **The estimate disclaimer always stays in the response text** as well.
- **Skip an individual chart when its own data threshold is not met** (each
  threshold is stated below): a chart nobody can read is worse than no chart.
  Skipping one chart never means skipping the panel.
- **Only the cards and charts specified below.** Do not invent extra ones, and do
  not promote a categorical value to a bar — a chip or plain text is the honest
  rendering for it.
- **If no visual surface is available at all**, fall back to the markdown table
  plus the same figures written as text cards. Never block on visuals, and never
  leave the answer without its numbers.

The panel contains:

- **Three cards:** number of keywords, the number-one term, and the least-disputed
  term (the one with the fewest competing products among the top).
- **A horizontal bar** of the top ~15 keywords (in rank order) showing the
  competing-product count per term, so the most-searched terms and how crowded
  each is are visible at a glance. Optionally flag low-competition (opportunity)
  terms. Render the chart only when there are enough keywords (skip under about
  five).

## Notes & Guardrails

The seller should never see a system or stack error — only a friendly next step.

- **No keywords for the category:** say plainly that no trending terms were found
  and suggest a broader or adjacent category.
- **The seller asks about Shopee:** say plainly that search-keyword data does not
  exist for Shopee, so there is nothing to rank — do not improvise a substitute.
  Offer the nearest real alternative instead: Shopee category analytics, or the
  best-selling items in the Shopee category by estimated recent sales. If it is
  unclear which marketplace they mean (an identifier beginning `MLB` is Mercado
  Livre, a bare 10–11 digit number is Shopee), ask before answering.
- **Data temporarily unavailable:** retry once quietly; if it is still down, say
  the data is temporarily unavailable and to try again. Never paste internal error
  text, HTTP codes, or field names to the seller.
