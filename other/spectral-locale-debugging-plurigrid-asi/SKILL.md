# spectral-locale-debugging

Debug and simulate ghostly phenomena using ordered locale theory and trifurcated interactions

## Capabilities

- Model ghosts as trifurcated agents in a locale with way-below relations
- Simulate ghostly manifestations using MCP and Narya formalizations
- Debug hauntings by verifying spectral conservation and frame laws
- Generate synthetic ghosts with deterministic seeding and trifurcated behaviors
- Integrate with Zig for compile-time ghost code elimination and runtime spectral simulations

## Implementation

Combine ordered locale theory with agent-based modeling to create a framework for debugging and simulating ghostly phenomena. Use Zig's comptime features to toggle ghost code in simulations, while leveraging MCP and Narya to model spectral interactions. Implement trifurcated decision-making for ghost behaviors (residual, liminal, active) and validate spectral conservation using GF(3) arithmetic. Integrate with ABM systems to study emergent ghostly behaviors in artificial life simulations.
