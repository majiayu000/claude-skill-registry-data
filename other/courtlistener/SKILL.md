# CourtListener for empirical legal research

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

Free Law Project's corpus. Three access routes with very different properties, and one
distinction that people get wrong before they start.

## The two corpora are not the same thing

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
**"CourtListener is federal-only" is true of RECAP and FALSE of opinions.** Getting this wrong
sends you to a paid vendor for state-court data that is sitting here free.

| corpus | source | coverage | contains |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Opinions** (case law) | scraped from court websites | federal **and state** | written decisions, full text |
| **RECAP** | PACER | **federal only** | docket entries, motions, filings |

The tell is on the court record itself: `pacer_court_id: null` + `has_opinion_scraper: true`
means a scraped state court, not a PACER one. Verified on Delaware Chancery:

```
GET /api/rest/v4/courts/delch/
  "full_name": "Court of Chancery of Delaware"
  "jurisdiction": "SA"            <- state
  "has_opinion_scraper": true
  "pacer_court_id": null          <- NOT RECAP
```
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Pick the route before writing any code

| route | auth | best for | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bulk data files** | **none** | any corpus-scale analysis | quarterly snapshot, big files |
| REST API v4 | `search`/`courts` unauth; `dockets` needs a token | targeted queries, current data | rate-limited, polite pacing on you |
| DB replication / MCP | membership or commercial | continuous sync | contact FLP |

**Default to bulk for research.** It is public domain, needs no account, and does not rate-limit
you. Reach for the API only when you need data newer than the last quarterly snapshot, or when
you want a few hundred records rather than a corpus.

## Bulk data

No authentication. Public Domain Mark. Regenerated **quarterly on the last day of March, June,
September and December**. Snapshots, not deltas — each file is the whole table.

```
https://com-courtlistener-storage.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/?list-type=2&prefix=bulk-data/
aws s3 ls s3://com-courtlistener-storage/bulk-data/ --no-sign-request
```

Measured sizes, 2026-06-30 snapshot:

| file | size | carries |
|---|---:|---|
| `opinions-YYYY-MM-DD.csv.bz2` | **54.6 GB** | opinion **full text** |
| `opinion-clusters-…` | 2.46 GB | court, `date_filed`, case name, `docket_number` |
| `dockets-…` | 5.01 GB | docket metadata |
| `courts-…` | <10 MB | the court table |
| `citation-map-…` | 0.52 GB | citation graph |

Also published: financial disclosures, judges, oral arguments, and ~2 TB of ModernBERT opinion
embeddings at `s3://com-courtlistener-storage/embeddings/opinions/`.

**Filter clusters first, then stream opinions.** `opinion-clusters` is 22× smaller and carries
the court and date. Select the cluster ids you want, then stream-decompress the 54 GB opinions
file and keep only matching rows. Never materialise the opinions CSV.

Files are `PostgreSQL COPY TO` output: CSV, UTF-8, header row. Schema dumps are published
alongside; field definitions are in the CourtListener GitHub `models.py`, or via an `OPTIONS`
request to the matching API endpoint.

## REST API v4

```
https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v4/
```

- `search` and `courts` work **unauthenticated** — 3,358 `delch` opinions were pulled in 206
  unauthenticated calls.
- `dockets` returns `{"detail":"Authentication credentials were not provided."}` without a token.
- Token lives at `/profile/api/` — **which sits behind a "Let's confirm you are human"
  interstitial**. That gate is the site's bot check and belongs to Free Law Project; the user
  clears it, not you.
- Search type params: `type=o` opinions, `type=r` RECAP dockets.

**Pace politely and back off on 429/5xx.** This is a nonprofit's free service; without a token
there is no quota to raise, so courtesy is the entire budget.

## API Facts

- **`suitNature` is not normalised.** The same NOS 160 appears as `Stockholders Suits`,
  `160 Contract: Stockholders Suits` and `160 Stockholders Suits`. Query the *text*
  (`suitNature:"Stockholders Suits"`), not the numeric code, or you silently lose most of the set.
- **Derivative suits are docketed under more than one NOS.** `"shareholder derivative"` returns
  1,670 under NOS 160 and 2,020 under 850 (Securities/Commodities). Filtering to 160 alone drops
  more than half.
- **`docketNumber` carries the C.A. number**, which joins directly to a Delaware Chancery docket
  from Lex Machina or CourtConnect — measured at **100% match** on 2,350 rows. That join is what
  lets a filing universe from one source meet a ruling from this one.
- **Opinions are written decisions only, and that is a selection, not a gap.** Measured against a
  verified Chancery filing universe: **82% of caption-derivative filings never produce a written
  opinion**, because most dispositions are bench rulings from the transcript. An outcome variable
  built from opinions describes the selected fifth. Reporting a dismissal rate without that
  denominator is an unverified claim dressed as a finding.
- **The bulk snapshot lags up to a quarter.** The 2026-06-30 file lands two weeks after a
  2026-06-15 event, so a study of anything recent gets a truncated post-period until the next
  drop. Check the snapshot date against your event date before designing the test.

## Coverage and what is coming

Delaware Chancery: **3,358 opinions since 2012** (`delch`). Texas currently covers the Supreme
Court, Court of Criminal Appeals and the 15 civil courts of appeal.

From the FLP wiki, verbatim:

> "In 2026, we are collecting content from high and appellate courts at the five most populous
> states: California, New York, Texas, Florida, and Pennsylvania."

> "In 2027 we aim to continue this with the Delaware Chancery Court and the next most populous
> states."

The 2027 item is **filings**, not opinions — Chancery opinions already exist. Docket-level state
coverage would reach the bench rulings the opinion corpus structurally cannot see.

## Red Flags — STOP if you catch yourself

| About to | Why wrong | Do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Tell the user CourtListener is federal-only | True of RECAP, false of opinions — state case law is there | Check `pacer_court_id` / `has_opinion_scraper` on the court |
| Page the REST API for a corpus-scale pull | Rate-limited, slow, and rude to a nonprofit when the same data is a free download | Bulk files |
| Clear the human-verification interstitial to get a token | It is the site's bot check, and you are a bot | Ask the user; or use the unauthenticated endpoints, which cover most needs |
| Decompress the 54 GB opinions CSV to disk | You need a few thousand rows of it | Filter `opinion-clusters` first, then stream and match |
| Filter derivative suits on NOS 160 alone | 2,020 of them are docketed 850 | `160 OR 850` plus a text filter, then hand-check |
| Report a dismissal rate from opinions without the selection denominator | 82% of filings never get a written opinion; the rate describes the selected fifth | Quantify selection against a filing universe and lead with it |
| Assume the bulk snapshot is current | Quarterly, and the boundary may fall days after your event | Read the snapshot date; use the API for the tail |
