name: Backend Queries
description: Write secure, optimized database queries using parameterized statements, eager loading, and proper indexing to prevent SQL injection and N+1 query problems. Use this skill when writing database queries, using ORM query methods, implementing data fetching logic, or optimizing database performance. When working with SQL queries, ORM query builders, repository patterns, or data access layers. When implementing joins, eager loading, query optimization, transactions, or query caching. When selecting data, filtering records, or fetching related associations in service files, repository files, or controller methods.

# Backend Queries

## When to use this skill

- When writing database queries in any backend file
- When using ORM query methods (e.g., ActiveRecord, Sequelize, Prisma, SQLAlchemy)
- When implementing eager loading or joins to prevent N+1 queries
- When writing raw SQL queries or query builders
- When optimizing query performance or adding indexes
- When implementing transactions for related database operations
- When adding query timeouts or performance monitoring
- When implementing query caching strategies
- When selecting specific columns instead of using SELECT *
- When working in service files, repository files, or data access layers that fetch data

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend queries.
