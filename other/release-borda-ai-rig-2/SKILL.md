# Release

Prepare substantial, source-grounded release communication and SemVer readiness evidence. Never tag, publish, upload, or force-push. Release documents serve users; the final workflow report serves maintainers and does not replace the release draft.

## Input Schema

```json
{
  "mode": "optional notes|prepare|audit|demo; default notes",
  "range": "optional base..head or base->head; not a target version",
  "target_version": "optional SemVer version",
  "changelog": "optional boolean; --changelog updates the existing changelog without pruning history",
  "summary": "optional boolean; --summary writes a standalone executive summary",
  "migration": "optional boolean; --migration writes standalone upgrade guidance",
  "append": "optional boolean; --append reconciles an existing draft with newly landed changes",
  "done_when": "release blockers, warnings, and required artifacts are explicit"
}
```

## Workflow

<!-- policy-sibling: skills/assess/SKILL.md, skills/code-remediate/SKILL.md, skills/code-review/SKILL.md -->

For allowed GitHub reads, run the direct reader under current effective network and filesystem grants or request runtime approval for the complete owning command when required capability is unavailable. No separate workflow consent is needed. Apply [GitHub Read Execution](../../shared/native-skill-contract.md#github-read-execution); an unexpected runtime restriction or denial stops the attempt.

When runtime permissions show network access enabled and the helper's required paths writable, omit `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` on the direct helper call; give no approval brief. Apply GitHub Read Execution even when the active profile name is omitted. A missing label or failed lookup does not mean disabled access; do not run `codex execpolicy list` to detect a profile. Preserve explicit destination restrictions and check report, `.git`, and checkout paths separately where applicable. Use the ordinary approval boundary only for unavailable required capability, and stop on denial.

### 01: Create run directory

Run `create_run.py --skill release` per `../../shared/helper-cli-contract.md`.

### 02: Determine mode, range, and target version

Select the release mode from the direct request. Local-only notes and checks remain local.

- Default `notes`: write `DRAFT.md`; optional `--changelog`, `--summary`, `--migration`, `--append` map to the boolean fields above.
- `prepare <version>`: readiness audit plus `DRAFT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `MIGRATION.md` in the established release directory (otherwise `releases/<version>/`); update the canonical changelog without replacing its history. A feature demo is optional and must be executed before inclusion.
- `audit [version]`: evidence and readiness verdict only; no product or release-document edits. Infer an omitted version only from verified project metadata.
- `demo [range]`: write and execute a release demonstration using the project environment; a plan alone is incomplete. Never required for non-feature releases.

Normalize `base->head` to `base..head`; retain both literal input and resolved commit IDs. Reject unknown flags, ambiguous ranges, symmetric `...` ranges, or incompatible mode/flag combinations before writing release docs. `--append` applies to notes only; other artifact flags apply to notes (prepare already includes them). A bare version supplies `target_version`, not a Git range. Read [release-evidence.md](release-evidence.md) for every mode; read [release-writing.md](release-writing.md) for notes, prepare, append, or demo.

Record mode, authorized output paths, target version, working-tree baseline, and acceptance in the run plan. Existing user content is input to preserve. Preparation does not independently authorize source/API/dependency edits or version stamping; change project version files only when requested or required by the user's authorized project release workflow.

### 03: Collect release evidence

Use [GitHub Reader Runtime Boundary](../../shared/native-skill-contract.md#github-reader-runtime-boundary) when the normal workflow calls `github_read.py`. Do not create or modify runtime approval rules files. Runtime denial stops the current attempt under the existing recovery policy. Remote publication, tagging, uploading, and other remote mutation remain forbidden.

Follow `release-evidence.md`: pin the release head, select a channel-appropriate baseline, inventory the release branch, and subtract changes already shipped to that release line using ancestry and patch evidence. A nearest tag, same subject, PR number, merge label, or default-branch listing alone cannot establish membership. Save the full candidate log to `<run-directory>/commits.txt` and the scope decision to `release-scope.md`. Initial releases include the root commit; empty or unavailable evidence is never a successful empty release.

When current GitHub release metadata is required, use `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/github_read.py --out <run-directory>/github-release.json -- gh release view <tag-or-url> --json <fields>` directly under current effective grants per GitHub Read Execution or with runtime approval for unavailable required capability. It prefers `gh`; public HTTPS fallback is only for public REST resources and cannot supply private evidence. Never invoke `gh` directly. An unexpected restriction or denial stops the attempt; record current release metadata as unavailable evidence.

Inspect `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/collect_diff.py --help`; collect `commit` scope for retained release range into `<run-directory>/range`. Collection failure is evidence gap, not empty release.

Write `<run-directory>/change-table.md`: every candidate SHA, PR/source evidence, disposition and reason, release section, user impact, breaking status, docs need, verification. Group related changes in prose while retaining every supporting commit/PR. Write `contributors.md` with complete human attribution and exclusions, and `changelog-audit.md` with scope, preserved history/detail, additions and unresolved discrepancies. These are required evidence even when changelog writing is not selected; audit mode records findings without editing it.

### 04: Verify release readiness

Required checks:

- SemVer classification matches observed API/user-visible changes.
- Breaking changes have migration guidance.
- Deprecations follow project policy and released before removal.
- CHANGELOG/release notes mention user-visible changes.
- Do not advertise reverted changes as live features.
- Call out security/dependency changes with source evidence.
- Verify claims against the pinned release head, including merged-in work and public examples; classification follows actual behavior, not commit prefixes or known local callers alone.
- Reconcile every candidate commit, all human contributors, and existing changelog content before declaring coverage complete. Missing contributor notes block communication completion; unresolved handles alone do not when verified names are credited.

**Structural context (optional)**: for Python package release, also probe codemap-py once for undocumented public surface and externally-uncalled modules: `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/codemap_adapter.py context --category audit --out <run-directory>/codemap-context.json`. Per `../../shared/codemap-contract.md`, absence/incompatibility is non-fatal — continue with checks above, using persisted evidence as additional readiness signal.

Write `<run-directory>/release-readiness.md` with:

- `SemVer`
- `Migration`
- `Checks`
- `Blockers`

Under `## Checks`, require a readiness table with exactly `Check | Status | Evidence | Blocker / next action`. Include rows `SemVer`, `Migration`, `Release scope`, `Contributors`, `Changelog`, `Documentation`, `Verification`, and `Artifacts`; add project-specific checks as needed. Status is `pass`, `fail`, `warning`, `not-applicable`, or `unavailable`. Every row needs concrete evidence and either `None` or the owner and closure action; not-applicable rows explain why. Missing required evidence is unavailable/blocked, never pass. Retain this table even in a failed run.

For `prepare`/`audit`, read and apply `../../shared/specialist-orchestration.md` only for public API changes, CI/release automation, security/dependency changes, docs/migration work, or broad verification risk; otherwise do not load it. Write `<run-directory>/specialist-release-plan.md` with narrow context packs for:

- `oss-shepherd`: SemVer, deprecation policy, maintainer readiness.
- `cicd-steward`: release workflow, publishing, CI status, artifact gates.
- `doc-scribe`: changelog, migration guide, README/examples.
- `qa-specialist`: verification matrix and test evidence.
- `security-auditor`: only when user expressly requests that advisory pass or selects the role for security/dependency-sensitive changes; it returns a bounded read-only evidence artifact to the Sol parent/session for release acceptance.
- `challenger`: release-blocker downgrade or no-blocker conclusion.

Single-agent for `notes` on narrow low-risk range unless SemVer/migration impact ambiguous.

### 05: Produce and review communication

Apply `release-writing.md` and [release-draft.md](release-draft.md). Preserve substantial changelog detail, historical versions, existing contributor credits, and hand-authored additions. Produce each selected artifact; revalidate the final merged contents on append, including stale summaries and examples. Write `draft-review.md` with claim traceability, contributor coverage, changelog preservation, example validation, artifact paths, and unresolved limitations. Audit records these checks without creating a draft. A failed readiness gate may leave clearly labeled reviewable drafts, never a release-ready claim.

Before selecting a demo as complete, use the explicit `shared/release_evidence.py` recorder described in `release-evidence.md` after execution authorization. Bind its actual output and before/after script digests. Syntax checks, headings, arbitrary credit labels, and nonempty secondary files cannot replace the receipt's source/content/execution checks.

### 06: Run required checks from `../../shared/quality-gates.md`

Inspect `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/run_gates.py --help`; run every project-required release gate with explicit commands/skip reasons and `--expected-head <release-head-full-sha>`. Execute from a verified clean checkout of that exact commit; when the caller's checkout differs or contains edits, use a separate clean detached worktree/snapshot without switching, resetting, or discarding caller work. Keep the absolute run directory outside the tested source or Git-ignored. Verify commands, imports and environment resolve to this snapshot rather than an installed copy or another checkout.

The runner records each executable check's expected head and observed Git head/status before and after execution. A mismatch, dirty state or failed inspection blocks the gate, even if its command exits zero. Do not remove the flag, substitute a fabricated receipt, or downgrade this failure to a warning. Skipped checks retain explicit reasons and need no execution receipt. Record source location, environment/import verification and observed receipts in `draft-review.md`; unavailable execution remains blocked where required.

### 07: Classify blockers and warnings

- `critical`: publish would ship known security/data-loss/API breakage without mitigation.
- `high`: SemVer, release-membership, attribution coverage, changelog preservation, migration, or required-check gap blocks readiness.
- `medium`: incomplete optional docs, unavailable optional profile links, uncertain compatibility requiring a named check.
- `low`: wording, formatting, or optional artifact polish.

### 08: Decide gate result, write `result.candidate.json`, validate artifacts, and publish `.reports/codex/release/<timestamp>/result.json`

Follow `../../shared/helper-cli-contract.md` and authoritative help. Write `RELEASE_METADATA` with `release_contract_version=1`, `mode`, `target_version`, resolved range, `release_head` (full lowercase 40- or 64-character commit SHA), `requested_artifacts` (names among `DRAFT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `MIGRATION.md`, `demo.py`), and the `release_evidence` receipt defined in `release-evidence.md`. Passing results require every executable gate's clean before/after receipt to match `release_head`. Save exact final copies of selected deliverables in `<run-directory>/deliverables/`; bind their actual project destinations and SHA-256 hashes in the receipt. Notes always requires the draft; prepare requires all four Markdown files (the zero-breaking-change carve-out for `MIGRATION.md` content, not the file itself, is in `release-writing.md`); demo requires the executed script and receipt. Audit has an empty artifact list but still binds scope, contributor, and changelog evidence. On fail/timeout retain the requested list and explain unfinished outputs; do not fabricate them or unavailable source receipts. Validate as `release`, promote only validated candidate. Old reports lacking the version remain readable; new runs must not omit it to bypass communication checks.

## Fail-Fast Rules

01. Missing or invalid target range for notes/prepare/demo => fail.
02. Invalid SemVer target for prepare/audit => fail.
03. Breaking change without migration decision => fail.
04. Release blocker presented as warning => fail.
05. Publish/tag/upload action attempted by this skill => fail.
06. Missing `release-readiness.md` SemVer, Migration, Checks, or Blockers evidence => fail.
07. Result artifact validator failure => fail.
08. Result artifact missing => fail.
09. Passing notes/prepare result without selected deliverables, complete human credits, claim traceability, or changelog preservation evidence => fail.
10. Prior-release subtraction inferred from subjects alone, missing release-line decision, or claims about code absent from the pinned release head => fail.
11. Append overwrites user content, drops history/detail without a verified correction, or advances its checkpoint before final validation => fail.

## Quality Gates

Release readiness requires all five shared gates + shared artifact validator unless project has no executable package; record any skipped executable check as gap.

Notes-only work may mark unrelated build/type/test gates not applicable with explicit reasons; communication review and artifact validation remain mandatory. Separate successfully drafted notes from release readiness. Hosted checks must bind to their exact commit; they do not verify later local edits. The artifact validator binds local source, artifact bytes, human credits and aggregate bot accounting; it cannot prove PR-discovery completeness, classification truth or prose accuracy. The semantic review must establish those properties using `release-evidence.md` and `release-writing.md`.

## Calibration Hooks

On SemVer, deprecation, changelog, or release-blocker policy change, update calibration:

- behavioral cases: missing migration, wrong SemVer, unreleased API removal, artifact validator bypass, networked CLI owning-command approval, diverged release branch, released patch equivalence, same-title unrelated commits, contributor omissions, human noreply/coauthor attribution, changelog detail/history pruning, first release, append revert/pivot, draft versus readiness
- benchmark patterns: `release`

## Output Contract

Before writing result candidate, follow `../../shared/final-handoff-contract.md`: render and bind `final-handoff.json`, `final.md`, and `final-handoff.validation.json`; after both validators and promotion pass, emit `final.md` verbatim.

Use `../../shared/quality-gates.md`.

### Final chat

Final chat follows shared ordered frame. `Outcome` is `release-ready`, `blocked`, or `warning-only`. `Results` has one material change or blocker per row and exactly `Change | SemVer impact | Status / blocker | Evidence`. Apply shared `Verification`, `Remaining`, `Next steps`, `Confidence`, and supplemental `Artifact` rules; include release gates and every blocker/warning with owner and closure action.

Set `outcome.title` exactly: failed/timed-out results use `blocked`; passing notes/demo or any readiness warning uses `warning-only`; only passing prepare/audit with cleared readiness uses `release-ready`. The summary explains completed draft work and remaining readiness scope. New communication-contract results require schema v2 and its validated final handoff. The shared explicit caller-contract exception still honors a user's exact requested format; never select it merely to omit the readiness table.

Add a `Readiness` table with exactly `Check | Status | Evidence | Blocker / next action`, copying the rows from `release-readiness.md` without shortening away evidence or recovery. Bind separate source IDs for change rows and readiness checks. New release handoffs therefore have the changes table plus readiness table; the shared renderer retains historical one-table compatibility. For notes-only completion, state draft completion and unassessed release readiness explicitly; do not use `release-ready` when required release checks were outside scope.

Minimum artifact payload template: `result-template.json`.
