<objective>
Enforces SOLID and DRY architecture on Astro projects: files under 100 lines (split at 90), all TypeScript types moved to `src/interfaces/` (never in component files), mandatory JSDoc on exported functions, no business logic in `src/pages/`, and mandatory grepping for existing logic/utilities in `src/lib/` and `src/components/` before writing new code.

Provides ready-to-copy templates for components, layouts, services, and interfaces that already follow these rules. This is a cross-cutting code-quality skill, not a feature skill — it doesn't teach Astro APIs themselves (see astro-7, astro-content, astro-i18n, astro-styling for that), only how to structure the code that uses them.

# SOLID Astro — Modular Architecture

## Agent Workflow (MANDATORY)

Before ANY implementation, spawn 3 agents in parallel, one `Agent` call each with a `name`:

1. **fuse-ai-pilot:explore-codebase** - Analyze project structure, naming, and existing patterns
2. **fuse-ai-pilot:research-expert** - Verify Astro 7 architecture best practices via Context7/Exa
3. **mcp__context7__query-docs** - Check Astro component API and TypeScript integration

After implementation, run **fuse-ai-pilot:sniper** for validation.

---

## Codebase Analysis (MANDATORY)

Before ANY implementation:

1. Explore `src/` directory to understand existing architecture
2. Read existing similar files to follow established naming and patterns
3. Grep for similar function/component names before creating new ones
4. Identify where interfaces, utilities, and shared logic live

---

## DRY Enforcement (MANDATORY)

Before writing ANY new code:

1. **Grep for similar logic** — function names, class patterns, component names
2. Check `src/lib/` for existing utilities
3. Check `src/components/` for existing UI components
4. If logic appears in 2+ places → extract to `src/lib/`
5. If types appear in 2+ files → move to `src/interfaces/`

---

## Absolute Rules

- Files < 100 lines — split at 90
- All types in `src/interfaces/` — never in component files
- JSDoc mandatory on all exported functions
- No business logic in `src/pages/`

See `references/architecture.md`, `references/file-limits.md`, `references/solid-principles.md`.

## Forbidden

- Files > 100 lines (split at 90)
- TypeScript interfaces in component `.astro` files
- Business logic in `src/pages/` files
- Direct CMS/API calls in components (use `src/lib/` services)
- Copy-pasting logic instead of extracting shared function
- Missing JSDoc on exported functions, components, and types
- `any` TypeScript type
