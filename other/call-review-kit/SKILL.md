# Call Review Kit Skill

## When to Use
- Weekly manager call reviews or peer coaching circles.
- Prepping enablement-led film sessions with highlight clips.
- Running virtual/asynchronous call breakdowns with shared notes.

## Framework
1. **Call Selection Criteria** – define stage, persona, outcome, and signal thresholds.
2. **Agenda Blueprint** – intro, clip playback, group discussion, scoring, commitments.
3. **Scorecard Template** – sections for core competencies, comments, and ratings.
4. **Engagement Mechanics** – polls, chat prompts, breakout instructions, facilitator notes.
5. **Action Tracker** – capture commitments, due dates, and success metrics.

## Templates
- Call review agenda + facilitation notes.
- Scorecard worksheet (per rep + group summary).
- Follow-up email template with recap + assignments.

## Tips
- Rotate presenters and keep clips <3 minutes to maintain engagement.
- Invite cross-functional observers (SE, PMM) for broader perspective.
- Pair with `reinforcement-drills` for post-session assignments.
