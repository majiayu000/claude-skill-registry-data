# Staged Hydration Systems (React 18)

## Summary

Develop staged hydration systems for prioritizing critical UI regions and progressive interactivity.

## Key Capabilities

- Schedule hydration order for user-critical components.
- Integrate streaming SSR with client hydration stages.
- Handle partial hydration failures gracefully.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Prove correctness of hydration ordering constraints.
- Optimize hydration schedules under CPU constraints.
- Analyze interactivity gains with staged hydration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Demonstrate staged hydration with measurable TTI gains.
- Provide a hydration schedule and rationale.
- Document fallback behavior when hydration fails.
