# Cirq - Quantum Computing with Python

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/cirq` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# Cirq - Quantum Computing with Python Cirq is Google Quantum AI's open-source framework for designing, simulating, and running quantum circuits on quantum computers and simulators.

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Core Capabilities, Common Patterns, Common Issues, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- You are designing, simulating, or executing quantum circuits with the Cirq ecosystem.
- You need Google Quantum AI-style primitives, parameterized circuits, or integrations like cirq-google and cirq-ionq.
- You are prototyping or teaching quantum workflows in Python and want concrete circuit examples.
- Use when the request clearly matches the imported source intent: Cirq is Google Quantum AI's open-source framework for designing, simulating, and running quantum circuits on quantum computers and simulators.
- Use when the operator should preserve upstream workflow detail instead of rewriting the process from scratch.
- Use when provenance needs to stay visible in the answer, PR, or review packet.

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. bash uv pip install cirq For hardware integration: bash # Google Quantum Engine uv pip install cirq-google # IonQ uv pip install cirq-ionq # AQT (Alpine Quantum Technologies) uv pip install cirq-aqt # Pasqal uv pip install cirq-pasqal # Azure Quantum uv pip install azure-quantum cirq
2. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
3. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
4. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
5. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
6. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
7. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @cirq-v2 to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @cirq-v2 against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @cirq-v2 for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @cirq-v2 using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Quick Start

### Basic Circuit

```python
import cirq
import numpy as np

# Create qubits
q0, q1 = cirq.LineQubit.range(2)

# Build circuit
circuit = cirq.Circuit(
    cirq.H(q0),              # Hadamard on q0
    cirq.CNOT(q0, q1),       # CNOT with q0 control, q1 target
    cirq.measure(q0, q1, key='result')
)

print(circuit)

# Simulate
simulator = cirq.Simulator()
result = simulator.run(circuit, repetitions=1000)

# Display results
print(result.histogram(key='result'))
```

### Parameterized Circuit

```python
import sympy

# Define symbolic parameter
theta = sympy.Symbol('theta')

# Create parameterized circuit
circuit = cirq.Circuit(
    cirq.ry(theta)(q0),
    cirq.measure(q0, key='m')
)

# Sweep over parameter values
sweep = cirq.Linspace('theta', start=0, stop=2*np.pi, length=20)
results = simulator.run_sweep(circuit, params=sweep, repetitions=1000)

# Process results
for params, result in zip(sweep, results):
    theta_val = params['theta']
    counts = result.histogram(key='m')
    print(f"θ={theta_val:.2f}: {counts}")
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Circuit Design
- Use appropriate qubit types for your topology
- Keep circuits modular and reusable
- Label measurements with descriptive keys
- Validate circuits against device constraints before execution
- Simulation
- Use state vector simulation for pure states (more efficient)

### Imported Operating Notes

#### Imported: Best Practices

1. **Circuit Design**
   - Use appropriate qubit types for your topology
   - Keep circuits modular and reusable
   - Label measurements with descriptive keys
   - Validate circuits against device constraints before execution

2. **Simulation**
   - Use state vector simulation for pure states (more efficient)
   - Use density matrix simulation only when needed (mixed states, noise)
   - Leverage parameter sweeps instead of individual runs
   - Monitor memory usage for large systems (2^n grows quickly)

3. **Hardware Execution**
   - Always test on simulators first
   - Select best qubits using calibration data
   - Optimize circuits for target hardware gateset
   - Implement error mitigation for production runs
   - Store expensive hardware results immediately

4. **Circuit Optimization**
   - Start with high-level built-in transformers
   - Chain multiple optimizations in sequence
   - Track depth and gate count reduction
   - Validate correctness after transformation

5. **Noise Modeling**
   - Use realistic noise models from calibration data
   - Include all error sources (gate, decoherence, readout)
   - Characterize before mitigating
   - Keep circuits shallow to minimize noise accumulation

6. **Experiments**
   - Structure experiments with clear separation (data generation, collection, analysis)
   - Use ReCirq patterns for reproducibility
   - Save intermediate results frequently
   - Parallelize independent tasks
   - Document thoroughly with metadata

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills/skills/cirq`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

#### Imported: Common Issues

**Circuit too deep for hardware:**
- Use circuit optimization transformers to reduce depth
- See `transformation.md` for optimization techniques

**Memory issues with simulation:**

- Reduce number of qubits or use stabilizer simulator for Clifford circuits

**Device validation errors:**
- Check qubit connectivity with device.metadata.nx_graph
- Decompose gates to device-native gateset
- See `hardware.md` for device-specific compilation

**Noisy simulation too slow:**
- Density matrix simulation is O(2^2n) - consider reducing qubits
- Use noise models selectively on critical operations only
- See `simulation.md` for performance optimization

#### Imported: Limitations

- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.
