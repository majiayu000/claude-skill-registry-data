  Updates tdmcp docs and roadmap for newly shipped or newly merged capabilities.
  Use when asked to update docs, update the roadmap, reconcile release
  docs, document new features, sync docs with CHANGELOG/package release, refresh
  cookbook examples after a feature wave, re-run/continue/fix a docs-roadmap pass,
  or check whether docs/ROADMAP.md is current. Runs a sub-agent workflow:
  release audit -> roadmap/docs edit + cookbook sync -> QA.

# tdmcp-docs-roadmap-update

Updates the repo's documentation surfaces after feature waves or releases:
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, high-level docs named by the audit, EN/PT prompt cookbooks,
and generated reference docs.

**Execution mode:** sub-agents. This environment does not use `TeamCreate`;
spawn the role agents defined in `.Codex/agents/` and coordinate them from the
main session.

## Phase 0: Context Check

Before spawning agents:

1. Inspect `git status --short`.
2. Check whether `_workspace/docs_release_audit.md`,
   `_workspace/roadmap_docs_update.md`, `_workspace/cookbook_sync_update.md`, or
   `_workspace/docs_roadmap_qa.md` already exist.
3. Decide execution mode:
   - no prior workspace files -> full run;
   - prior files + user says update/re-run/continue -> refresh only affected
     phases;
   - prior files + new release/tag/feature input -> refresh audit first, then
     re-run writers.

Preserve unrelated local changes. Do not reset or revert user edits.

## Phase 1: Release And Feature Audit

Spawn `docs-release-auditor`:

```text
Read .Codex/agents/docs-release-auditor.md and execute it.
Audit current local package, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, README, cookbook docs,
CLI/resource surfaces, generated docs, npm package version, GitHub releases, and
tags. Write _workspace/docs_release_audit.md.
```

The audit is mandatory whenever release wording, tool counts, or "latest"
features are involved.

## Phase 2: Docs Writing

After `_workspace/docs_release_audit.md` exists, spawn these agents in parallel
when their write sets are both needed:

**Roadmap/docs editor**

```text
Read .Codex/agents/roadmap-docs-editor.md and execute it.
Use _workspace/docs_release_audit.md. Update docs/ROADMAP.md and any high-level
docs named by the audit. Do not edit generated docs or cookbook files. Write
_workspace/roadmap_docs_update.md.
```

**Cookbook sync**

```text
Read .Codex/agents/docs-cookbook-sync.md and execute it.
Use _workspace/docs_release_audit.md and _workspace/roadmap_docs_update.md if it
exists. Update docs/guide/prompt-cookbook.md and docs/pt/guide/prompt-cookbook.md
for docs-worthy new features, keeping locales in parity. Write
_workspace/cookbook_sync_update.md.
```

If only roadmap docs or only cookbook docs are affected, run only the relevant
writer.

## Phase 3: Generated Docs And QA

Run the docs generation/build gate from the main session:

```bash
npm run docs:build
npm run validate:recipes
git diff --check
```

Then spawn `docs-roadmap-qa`:

```text
Read .Codex/agents/docs-roadmap-qa.md and execute it.
Use the release audit and writer summaries. Verify release claims, EN/PT parity,
generated docs behavior, VitePress media embeds, and command outcomes. Write
_workspace/docs_roadmap_qa.md.
```

If QA finds narrow issues, fix them in the main session or re-run only the
responsible writer.

## Data Flow

- Auditor writes `_workspace/docs_release_audit.md`.
- Roadmap editor writes `_workspace/roadmap_docs_update.md`.
- Cookbook sync writes `_workspace/cookbook_sync_update.md`.
- QA writes `_workspace/docs_roadmap_qa.md`.
- Final docs edits remain in normal repo files.

## Quality Rules

- Verify live release state before claiming a public version is current.
- Keep public release, local `HEAD`, and planned backlog distinct.
- Never hand-edit generated `docs/reference/tools.md`.
- Keep EN/PT cookbook examples in parity.
- Use `withBase('/examples/...')` for VitePress video embeds.
- Treat missing media assets as description-only or explicit follow-up, not as
  silent broken links.

## Test Scenarios

**Normal flow:** a new release lands. Audit confirms package/npm/GitHub agree,
roadmap is updated with shipped and remaining work, cookbook gets matching EN/PT
entries, `npm run docs:build`, `npm run validate:recipes`, and
`git diff --check` pass.

**Error flow:** npm or GitHub release checks fail. Auditor marks release state
unverified; writers avoid definitive public-release claims; QA records residual
risk and asks for a retry or human release confirmation.
