# Forecast Discipline Guide Skill

## When to Use
- Running weekly/monthly forecast calls.
- Coaching managers on commit/best case criteria.
- Aligning go-to-market teams on inspection processes.

## Framework
1. **Forecast Tiers** – define commit, best case, pipeline, upside with clear exit criteria.
2. **Grading Rubric** – outline inspection questions and data required for each tier.
3. **Cadence** – schedule prep steps, live inspections, and follow-up check-ins.
4. **Accountability** – log actions, approvals, and exceptions tied to each commit change.
5. **Continuous Improvement** – review accuracy vs actuals, adjust rubric/cadence quarterly.

## Templates
- Forecast call agenda + checklist.
- Commit change request form.
- Accuracy retro template with action items.
- **GTM Agents Inspection Worksheet** – standardized questions (deal health, decision process, paper process, risk plan) @puerto/README.md#244-271.
- **KPI Guardrail Sheet** – pipeline coverage, conversion %, slip rate with alert thresholds.
- **Escalation Memo Template** – summary for Chief Strategy Officer when forecast misses guardrails.

## Tips
- Keep commit changes transparent and documented.
- Incorporate MEDDIC/BANT prompts into inspection scripts.
- Pair with CRM hygiene dashboards to ensure data supports forecast claims.
- Mirror GTM Agents cadence: Monday management prep, Tuesday deal desk sync, Thursday exec forecast call.
- Require written rationale for any commit movement >5% week over week.
- If guardrail breached twice in a quarter, trigger RevOps remediation sprint (see lifecycle rip-cord procedures).

## GTM Agents Forecast Governance Overlay
1. **Call Structure**
   - Start with KPI guardrail review (coverage, wins, slip rate) vs GTM Agents thresholds.
   - Run tiered inspection (commit → best case → upside) with standard worksheet.
   - Assign owners for each risk + resolution plan.
2. **Cadence & Artifacts**
   - Weekly: manager inspections + Sales Director roll-up.
   - Bi-weekly: cross-functional sync with Marketing Director + Customer Success Manager for pipeline risks.
   - Monthly: accuracy retro + adjustments to rubric.
3. **Escalation**
   - Trigger CSO briefing when coverage <3.5x or commit accuracy slips below 85%.
   - Provide summary memo using Escalation Template.

## KPI Guardrails (GTM Agents Reference)
- Pipeline coverage ≥4x for new logo, ≥3x for expansion.
- Commit accuracy ≥90% in-quarter; warn at 85%.
- Slip rate ≤10% QoQ; immediate review if >15%.
- Stage hygiene: 95% of commit deals must have next steps + mutual action plan logged.

## Inspection Questions (Excerpt)
1. What changed since last call? (Deal, champion, procurement, competition)
2. Do we have verifiable next steps and dates? Who owns them?
3. What negative signals exist? (product gaps, budget freeze, legal hurdles)
4. How will this impact coverage if it slips—what backfill exists?

Use these prompts in every inspection to match GTM Agents Sales Director rigor.
