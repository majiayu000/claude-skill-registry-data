# Flux Controller Patch Releases

Use this skill for upstream Flux controller patch releases only. Do not use it
for `flux2`, `pkg`, or other non-controller repos.

Supported controllers:
- `helm-controller`
- `image-automation-controller`
- `image-reflector-controller`
- `kustomize-controller`
- `notification-controller`
- `source-controller`
- `source-watcher`

## Important rules

- **Go deep until you block, then switch.** Drive one controller all the way
  through every step you can do locally — branch, changelog commit, version
  bump commit, push, open PR — before switching to the next. Only move on
  when you hit something you cannot progress (CI running, PR awaiting review,
  tag workflow running). The moment something unblocks (PR merged, CI green,
  workflow finished), come back to it immediately — do not finish the current
  controller's local work first if an earlier one is ready to advance.
- **Never block the conversation on long-running operations.** CI checks,
  release workflow runs, tag-triggered workflows, and similar waits must be
  watched in the background so the user can keep steering and so you can pick
  up any other controller the moment it unblocks. When a background watch
  completes, report the result and proceed.
- **Always quote PR/issue links as full URLs** (e.g.
  `https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-controller/pull/1465`), never the
  `<owner>/<repo>#<number>` shorthand — full URLs are clickable from the
  user's terminal, the shorthand is not.
- **Start background watches on every PR immediately after opening it.** Kick
  off `gh pr checks <num> -R fluxcd/<repo> --watch` in the background as
  soon as the PR is created so CI status lands in the conversation the
  moment it finishes. Do the same for tag-triggered release workflows
  (`gh run watch <id> -R fluxcd/<repo>` in the background). Do not wait
  until "everything is pushed" to start watching — start watching the first
  PR while you prepare the second. Note that `gh pr checks --watch` can finish
  early, reporting success on a set of checks that does not yet include a run
  it just re-triggered, so restart the watch (and re-read `gh pr checks <num>`)
  after any amend or force-push.
- **Also start a background approval watch per PR.** `gh pr checks --watch`
  only covers CI; it does not fire on maintainer approval. Poll the review
  state in the background so you are notified the moment it flips to
  APPROVED + CLEAN:
  ```
  while :; do
    state=$(gh pr view <num> -R fluxcd/<repo> --json mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision --jq '.reviewDecision+" "+.mergeStateStatus')
    case "$state" in "APPROVED CLEAN") echo "$state"; break;; esac
    sleep 30
  done
  ```
  Run this in the background; when it exits, merge the PR and proceed. The
  session's git user opens these PRs, so they cannot approve them: request a
  review from a maintainer with
  `gh pr edit <num> -R fluxcd/<repo> --add-reviewer <login>`, so the approval
  watch has a reviewer to fire on.
- Every git commit must use `-s` (sign-off). Never include Co-Authored-By
  lines, your own name, or any AI attribution in commit messages, PR titles,
  or PR descriptions. This applies to all PRs, including PRs that update this
  skill file itself.
- Always wait for CI to go green before merging any PR.
- You cannot approve your own PRs. If a PR was opened by the git user driving
  the session, ask a maintainer to approve it (or confirm it is already
  approved) before merging.
- **Merge release PRs yourself** (controller release PRs, changelog cherry-pick
  PRs) as soon as CI is green **and** a maintainer has approved. No need to
  ask the user to click merge — act on it immediately so the next step (tag
  push, etc.) unblocks. This applies only to PRs opened with the user's
  account during this session.
- **Review feedback on release PRs is applied by amending**, not by adding
  new commits. A release PR must stay at exactly two commits
  (`Add changelog entry for vX.Y.Z` and `Release vX.Y.Z`). When the fix
  belongs in the changelog, amend the changelog commit; when it belongs in
  the release bump, amend that one. Use
  `git reset --soft HEAD~2` + re-commit, or an interactive rebase, then
  `git push --force-with-lease`.
- **After applying a review fix, reply `Fixed, thanks!` on the thread and
  resolve it.** Reply via
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments/<cid>/replies -f body='Fixed, thanks!'`
  and resolve via the GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation. Find thread
  IDs with
  `gh api graphql -f query='{ repository(owner:"<o>",name:"<r>") { pullRequest(number:<n>) { reviewThreads(first:50) { nodes { id isResolved comments(first:1){nodes{databaseId body}} } } } } }'`.
- Do **not** watch CI on the skill-update PR continuously — it only needs to
  merge at the very end of the procedure, so check CI right before merging
  rather than keeping a watch open throughout the session.
- Tags must be annotated and signed (`git tag -s -m ...`). Never create
  release tags through the GitHub API — that produces lightweight tags which
  break `git tag -v` verification.
- Strictly follow the git commands documented in the release flow below. Do
  not invent substitutions or skip steps — each step has a reason.
- **Do not declare a controller "done" until every step in the Release Flow
  below has been executed for it**, including the final changelog
  cherry-pick PR back to `main` (step 11) *and that PR being merged*. Merging
  the release PR and tagging is *not* the last step, and neither is opening
  the cherry-pick PR. Before reporting completion, walk through each
  controller against the numbered steps and confirm each one ran.
- **Never halt while there is work you can do.** The session is over when
  every controller has been through all eleven steps and no PR opened during
  it is still waiting to be merged. Do not stop to report progress and wait
  for a prompt when nothing is blocking you — reporting is not a step, and
  "the PRs are open" is not a finish line. The only legitimate pauses are
  external: CI still running, a PR awaiting a maintainer's approval, a release
  workflow in flight. When one of those clears, act on it immediately instead
  of asking whether to continue.
- PRs opened by this procedure use the commit subject as the PR title and an
  empty body.

## Preconditions

- Read the upstream procedure at `website/content/en/flux/releases/procedure.md`,
  section `Controllers: patch releases`.
- Treat `git` and `gh` commands as confirmation points if the user wants that.
- Use `date` to get the release date for changelog entries.
- Fetch before reasoning about release branches or merged PRs. Do not trust stale
  local `origin/*` refs.

## Determining which controllers need a patch release

Do this first, for every supported controller, before touching any of them. Compare
the tip of each controller's **latest** release series branch against the most recent
tag on that series. If the branch is ahead of its tag, it needs a patch release and
the next version is the next patch increment of that tag.

```shell
for repo in helm-controller image-automation-controller image-reflector-controller \
            kustomize-controller notification-controller source-controller source-watcher; do
  cd ~/Documents/github.com/fluxcd/$repo
  git fetch --all --tags --prune
  br=$(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:lstrip=3)' 'refs/remotes/origin/release/v*.x' | sort -V | tail -1)
  series=${br#release/}; series=${series%.x}
  tag=$(git tag -l "${series}.*" --sort=-v:refname | grep -v '\-' | head -1)
  ahead=$(git rev-list --count "${tag}..origin/${br}")
  echo "$repo  $br  latest=$tag  ahead=$ahead  next=${tag%.*}.$(( ${tag##*.} + 1 ))"
done
```

Read the output as follows:

- `ahead=0` — nothing to release for that controller; skip it.
- `ahead>0` — the controller needs a patch release at the printed `next` version.
- Only the **latest** series (highest `vN.M`) is an automatic patch candidate.
  Older supported series are patched only for critical fixes, and picking one is a
  deliberate decision — never infer it from the loop alone.
- A series can be `ahead>0` because a release PR is already open for it. Check
  `gh pr list -R fluxcd/<repo> --state open --base release/vX.Y.x` before starting a
  new one, and resume that PR instead of opening a duplicate.
- Confirm the latest tag against GitHub with
  `gh api repos/fluxcd/<repo>/git/matching-refs/tags/v --jq '.[].ref'` — local tags and
  refs go stale when a fetch fails, which silently hides or invents unreleased commits.

## Release Flow

For each controller identified above as needing a patch release:

1. Refresh local state.
   - `git fetch --all --tags --prune`
   - `git switch release/vX.Y.x`
   - `git pull origin release/vX.Y.x`

2. Create the release preparation branch exactly from the release series branch.
   - `git switch -c release-vX.Y.Z release/vX.Y.x`

3. Draft the new `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
   - Use the existing changelog structure in that repo.
   - Use the current date from `date`.
   - Build the entry from the commits merged into the release series branch since
     the previous tag.
   - Prefer PR titles over commit subjects for bullets.
   - Check the PRs that introduced the changes; do not infer titles from local
     commit messages.
   - For dependency-update PRs, inspect the PR body, any referenced upstream
     PRs, and the `go.mod` diff for notable content (see "Dependency update
     PRs" below) rather than settling for a generic bump line.
   - In the intro paragraph, summarize the concrete bug fixes shipped in the
     patch release.

4. Commit the changelog entry.
   - `git add CHANGELOG.md`
   - `git commit -s -m "Add changelog entry for vX.Y.Z"`

5. Apply the release version bump exactly as documented.
   - Update the controller self-API version in the root `go.mod`.
   - Update `config/manager/kustomization.yaml` `newTag` to `vX.Y.Z`.
   - Commit with:
     - `git add go.mod config/manager/kustomization.yaml`
     - `git commit -s -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`

6. Push the release preparation branch.
   - `git push origin release-vX.Y.Z`

7. Open and merge the release PR into the release series branch.
   - Base: `release/vX.Y.x`
   - Head: `release-vX.Y.Z`
   - Merge with a merge commit (`gh pr merge <num> -R fluxcd/<repo> --merge`),
     not a squash: the tagged commit on the release series branch must keep
     both signed commits and the DCO history.

8. Refresh the release series branch after merge.
   - `git switch release/vX.Y.x`
   - `git pull origin release/vX.Y.x`

9. Create and push signed tags from the updated release series branch.
   Push the `api/` tag first — the release tag depends on it.
   - `git tag -s -m "api/vX.Y.Z" api/vX.Y.Z`
   - `git push origin api/vX.Y.Z`
   - `git tag -s -m "vX.Y.Z" vX.Y.Z`
   - `git push origin vX.Y.Z`

10. Confirm the non-`api/` tag triggered the release workflow.
    - It runs `release.yaml` on the `vX.Y.Z` tag; wait for it with
      `gh run watch <id> -R fluxcd/<repo> --exit-status`, then confirm a
      non-draft GitHub release was published (`gh release view vX.Y.Z`).

11. Cherry-pick only the changelog commit back to `main`.
   - `git switch main`
   - `git pull origin main`
   - `git switch -c pick-changelog-vX.Y.Z main`
   - `git cherry-pick -x <Add changelog entry commit>`
   - `git push origin pick-changelog-vX.Y.Z`
   - Open PR from `pick-changelog-vX.Y.Z` to `main`
   - Do this one controller at a time — never chain several controllers'
     cherry-picks into a single shell invocation. If such a batch is
     interrupted partway, the branches it already created make a later
     `git switch -c` fail, which silently leaves you on `main`, so the next
     `git cherry-pick` lands the changelog commit on local `main` instead of
     the pick branch. Before cherry-picking, confirm you are on
     `pick-changelog-vX.Y.Z`; if the branch already exists, switch to it (or
     delete and recreate it) rather than letting `switch -c` fail.

## How To Build The Changelog Entry

For a patch release, gather:
- the latest release tag on the release line
- the merged commits on `origin/release/vX.Y.x` since that tag
- the PRs corresponding to those merges

Write the new section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`:
- `## X.Y.Z`
- `**Release date:** YYYY-MM-DD`
- short intro paragraph describing the actual bug fixes in user-facing language
- `Fixes:` when there are bug-fix items
- `Improvements:` for dependency updates, docs, feature gates, or cleanup

Rules:
- Use PR titles, not raw commit messages
- Group multiple dependency bump PRs naturally when the repo history already does that
- Verify the title against GitHub when the local merge commit is vague

### Dependency update PRs

Do not reduce a dependency bump to a generic "Update fluxcd/pkg dependencies"
line and move on — the user-facing substance is usually hidden inside the bump.
Weigh Flux's own repos and third-party dependencies differently:

- **The `fluxcd/*` modules are what matter.** These are our own libraries, so a
  bump is how a fix we made reaches the controller. Trace every module in the
  `go.mod` diff back to its commits, e.g. in a local clone of `fluxcd/pkg`:
  `git log --oneline --no-merges <mod>/<old>..<mod>/<new> -- <mod>`, filtering
  out `Prepare for release` and the shared `Upgrade k8s to ...` commits. Read
  the PR behind each remaining commit and describe the fix in the controller's
  own terms. Doing this across all the modules of one release usually leaves a
  handful of real changes, which is a short enough list to reason about
  per controller.
- **Third-party bumps are noise unless they fix something our users hit.** Do
  not recount an upstream project's release notes, and do not list upstream
  CVE/GHSA advisories that merely rode along with a bump. Mention an upstream
  change only when it resolves an issue reported by Flux users, or when the
  upgrade itself is the point (e.g. syncing the Helm version with the one
  helm-controller ships) — and then say why it matters to Flux, not what
  changed upstream.
- **State the Kubernetes bump when `k8s.io/*` actually moves**, e.g. "which
  bring Kubernetes to 1.36.4". Read the version off the `go.mod` diff for that
  specific bump instead of assuming one is there: a `fluxcd/pkg` update may
  carry a Kubernetes bump, a module fix, both, or neither, and the same release
  window can move `k8s.io/*` for one controller and not for another.
- **Check whether the changed code is reachable from the controller**, and be
  as careful about wrongly leaving it out as about wrongly putting it in. A fix
  can land in a function the controller never calls, in which case it does not
  belong in that changelog; or in one the controller already calls, in which
  case the behavior change ships without any code change in the controller and
  *must* be in the changelog. `grep` the controller for the changed symbol and
  for the type that owns it. Example: `runtime/client` rejecting file
  references in kubeconfigs reached kustomize-controller purely through
  `Impersonator`, which kustomize-controller uses and the other controllers do
  not — so it changed how `.spec.kubeConfig` Secrets are accepted with no
  kustomize-controller commit behind it.
- When several controllers pull the same bump, use matching wording across
  their changelogs so readers can correlate them.
- Only mention a dependency change if it is relevant to what that controller
  actually does. A bumped module often ships capabilities the controller never
  exercises, and listing them implies a capability it does not have. For
  example, GCP sovereign cloud *artifact registry* support (shipped via a
  `pkg/auth` bump) is worth noting for source-controller and
  image-reflector-controller, which pull from registries, but not for
  image-automation-controller, which only talks to Git.

## Critical Checks

- Always fetch before comparing `tag..origin/release/...`.
- Always pull the release series branch before creating `release-vX.Y.Z`.
- Always pull the release series branch again after merging the release PR and
  before tagging.
- Always inspect the actual root `go.mod`; do not assume the self-API path form.
  `source-watcher` uses `github.com/fluxcd/source-watcher/api/v2`, so it still
  needs the same self-API release bump pattern.
- Do not silently special-case a controller. If the documented step seems not to
  apply, inspect the file and confirm before proceeding.
- Tag from the release series branch merge commit, not from the release prep branch.
- Cherry-pick only the changelog commit back to `main`, not the release version bump.
- When amending a release PR, confirm the version bump survived. After
  `git reset --soft HEAD~2`, do not `git checkout` `go.mod` or
  `config/manager/kustomization.yaml` — that restores them from the index and
  silently reverts the bump, leaving a release PR that only touches the
  changelog. Rebuild both commits, then check with
  `git diff origin/release/vX.Y.x --stat` that `CHANGELOG.md`, `go.mod` and
  `config/manager/kustomization.yaml` are all still modified.

## Updating this skill

- Improvements to this skill should land as a single-commit PR on a dedicated
  branch. When accumulating more changes during a release session, amend and
  force-push rather than adding new commits.
- Keep the skill-update PR open during the release session and merge it
  **last**, after all controller patch releases are done. Session learnings
  tend to surface throughout the flow; amend them in as they come up.
- Do not leak session-specific state, downstream/enterprise distribution
  details, or AI attribution into the skill file.

## Useful Local Queries

- Release branches:
  - `git branch -r --list 'origin/release/v*.x' | sort -V`
- Latest tags:
  - `git tag -l 'v*' | sort -V | tail`
- Commits since previous release on the release branch:
  - `git log --oneline <prev-tag>..origin/release/vX.Y.x`
- PR metadata for changelog bullets:
  - `gh pr view <number> -R fluxcd/<repo> --json number,title,url,baseRefName`
