# Work Plan

Generate a comprehensive execution plan showing current status, phase breakdown, and next actions. **Writes output to `{feature-path}/work-plan.md`** for persistent tracking.

## User Input

FEATURE_ID = $ARGUMENT (optional, defaults to current branch feature)

Accept feature ID like "001" or "001-mcp-integration". If not provided, extract from current git branch.

## Output Behavior

- **Primary output**: Write full work plan to `{feature-path}/work-plan.md`
- **Console output**: Show condensed summary with key status and next action
- **Updates**: Subsequent runs overwrite the file with current state (timestamp included)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Feature ID

1. If ARGUMENT provided:
   - Format "NNN" (e.g., "001"): Search `backlog/plans/` and `backlog/plans/_completed/` for matching folder
   - Format "NNN-slug" (e.g., "001-mcp-integration"): Use directly
2. If no ARGUMENT:
   - Run `git branch --show-current`
   - Extract feature ID from branch name (e.g., `feature/001-mcp-integration` → `001-mcp-integration`)
   - If not on a feature branch, show error and list available features

**Note**: In-progress features are in `backlog/plans/{NNN}-{slug}/`, completed features in `backlog/plans/_completed/{NNN}-{slug}/`

### Step 2: Load Feature Context

Read the following files:
- `{feature-path}/tasks.md` (required)
- `{feature-path}/spec.md` (for feature name/description)
- `specs/tests/{feature-id}.md` (if exists, for spec test info)
- Current git branch status

### Step 3: Parse tasks.md

Extract:

**Phase Information**:
- Phase headers: `## Phase N: Name`
- For each phase: number, name, description, task range, task count, completed count
- Entry spec test task (`[SPEC]` with "→ expect ALL FAIL")
- Exit spec test task (`[SPEC]` with "→ expect ALL PASS")

**Dependency Information**:
- Find dependency diagram (after "## Dependencies" header)
- Parse dependency arrows (──►, ──┬──►, etc.)
- Build dependency graph

**Overall Metrics**:
- Total task count, completed count, percentage

### Step 4: Determine Status

For each phase:
- **Complete**: All tasks checked (`- [x]`)
- **In Progress**: Some tasks checked
- **Not Started**: No tasks checked
- **Blocked**: Depends on incomplete phases

Identify current phase and next action.

### Step 5: Generate Work Plan

Build the work plan with these sections (see `references/output-format.md` for detailed templates):

1. **Current Status** - Feature name, branch, progress, current phase
2. **Phase Overview** - Table with status, progress, blocks
3. **Recommended Execution Plan** - Per-phase commands and goals
4. **Parallel Execution Strategy** - Wave structure for independent phases
5. **Quick Commands Reference** - Command table
6. **Success Criteria** - Completion checklist
7. **Manual Testing Strategy** - What needs manual testing and when
8. **Next Action** - Specific recommended command

### Step 6: Write to File

Write the complete work plan to `{feature-path}/work-plan.md`:

```markdown
<!-- Auto-generated by /work-plan - Updated: {ISO timestamp} -->

# Work Plan: Feature {NNN} - {Feature Name}

{All sections from Step 5}
```

**File behavior**:
- Creates new file if doesn't exist
- Overwrites existing file with fresh state on each run
- Includes timestamp header for tracking when last updated

### Step 7: Display Summary to Console

Show a condensed summary to the user (NOT the full file contents):

```
✅ Work plan written to: {feature-path}/work-plan.md

## Quick Status
- **Progress**: {completed}/{total} tasks ({percentage}%)
- **Current Phase**: {phase-name} ({status})

## Next Action
{next action recommendation with command}
```

This keeps console output minimal while the full details live in the file.

### Next Action Logic

| State | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Wrong branch / no tasks | Prime and start Phase 1 |
| Phase in progress | Continue current phase |
| Phase blocked | Complete blocking phase first |
| Ready for next | Start next phase |
| Multiple independent ready | Run phases in parallel |
| All complete | Final verification, create PR |

## Error Handling

**Feature not found**:
```
❌ Error: Feature '{feature-id}' not found

Available features:
{list folders in backlog/plans/ and backlog/plans/_completed/}

Usage: /work-plan {feature-number}
```

**tasks.md not found**:
```
❌ Error: tasks.md not found at {feature-path}/tasks.md

This feature may not follow the methodology structure.
```

## Output Guidelines

- Keep output concise but actionable
- Use emojis for visual clarity (✓, ⚠️, ✅, 🔄, ⏸️, 🔒)
- Provide specific commands, not just guidance
- Always include "Next Action" - never leave user wondering what to do
