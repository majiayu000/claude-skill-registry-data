# API Design Reviewer

## When to Use

- When reviewing an OpenAPI/Swagger specification before implementation
- When auditing existing API endpoints for consistency
- When designing a new API from scratch
- When preparing APIs for external/partner consumption

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Naming & Convention Check

| Check | Rule | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Resource naming | Plural nouns, kebab-case | ✅ `/api/v1/order-items` ❌ `/api/v1/getOrderItem` |
| HTTP methods | GET=read, POST=create, PUT=replace, PATCH=partial, DELETE=remove | ✅ `POST /orders` ❌ `POST /create-order` |
| Query params | camelCase for filters/sorting | ✅ `?sortBy=createdAt` ❌ `?sort_by=created_at` |
| Status codes | Use standard codes correctly | ✅ 201 Created, 204 No Content ❌ 200 for everything |
| Consistency | Same pattern across all endpoints | Check all resources follow same naming |

### Step 2 — Versioning Strategy

| Strategy | When to Use | Pattern |
|----------|------------|---------|
| URL path | Simple, widely adopted | `/api/v1/orders` |
| Header | Cleaner URLs, harder to test | `Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=1` |
| Query param | Easy to test, but less RESTful | `/api/orders?version=1` |

Verify:
- [ ] Version is present in all endpoints
- [ ] Deprecation policy documented
- [ ] Migration guide for version bumps

### Step 3 — Error Format

Errors should follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Human-readable description",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "issue": "Invalid format",
        "expected": "Valid email address"
      }
    ],
    "request_id": "req_abc123",
    "docs_url": "https://docs.api.com/errors/VALIDATION_ERROR"
  }
}
```

Check:
- [ ] Error format consistent across all endpoints
- [ ] Machine-readable error codes (not just messages)
- [ ] Request ID for traceability
- [ ] No sensitive data in error responses

### Step 4 — Pagination

| Pattern | Best For | Implementation |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| Cursor-based | Large datasets, real-time data | `?cursor=abc&limit=20` |
| Offset-based | Simple lists, admin UIs | `?page=2&per_page=20` |
| Keyset | Time-series data | `?after=2024-03-15T00:00:00Z&limit=20` |

Check:
- [ ] Default page size set (and documented)
- [ ] Maximum page size enforced
- [ ] Total count available (or explicitly omitted for performance)
- [ ] Links to next/prev pages in response

### Step 5 — Security Patterns

| Check | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Authentication | Bearer token, API key, OAuth2 — documented per endpoint |
| Authorization | Role-based access noted per endpoint |
| Rate limiting | Headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `Retry-After` |
| Input validation | Max lengths, allowed characters, type checking |
| CORS | Appropriate origins, methods, headers |

### Step 6 — Breaking Change Detection

Identify potential breaking changes:
- ❌ Removing a field from response
- ❌ Changing a field type (string → integer)
- ❌ Making an optional field required
- ❌ Changing endpoint URL
- ✅ Adding a new optional field
- ✅ Adding a new endpoint
- ✅ Adding a new optional query parameter

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Format |
|-------|----------|--------|
| API specification | Yes | OpenAPI/Swagger YAML/JSON or endpoint list |
| Business context | Recommended | Who consumes this API |
| Existing API | Recommended | For breaking change detection |

## Output

```markdown
## API Review — [API Name]

### Summary
**Endpoints reviewed:** 24 | **Issues found:** 8 | **Breaking changes:** 0

### Issues

| # | Severity | Category | Endpoint | Issue | Fix |
|---|----------|----------|----------|-------|-----|
| 1 | High | Naming | POST /createUser | Verb in URL | POST /users |
| 2 | Medium | Errors | All | No request_id | Add tracing ID |
| 3 | Low | Pagination | GET /logs | No max page size | Enforce limit ≤ 100 |

### Recommendations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Naming conventions checked across all endpoints
- [ ] Versioning strategy reviewed
- [ ] Error format consistency verified
- [ ] Pagination patterns assessed
- [ ] Security patterns checked
- [ ] Breaking changes flagged

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Feedback is specific and references exact locations in the reviewed material
- [ ] Each critique includes a concrete improvement suggestion
- [ ] Severity is categorized (critical / important / nice-to-have)
- [ ] Positive aspects are acknowledged alongside areas for improvement

## Verification (4C)

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Is the feedback technically accurate and properly contextualized? |
| **Completeness** | Were all major sections of the reviewed material addressed? |
| **Context-fit** | Is the review granularity appropriate for the material's maturity level? |
| **Consequence** | If the author implemented all feedback literally, what could go wrong? |

## Edge Cases

- **Material is too early-stage for detailed review** — Provide structural feedback only. Note that content review is deferred until it matures.
- **Reviewer lacks domain expertise** — Focus on structure, clarity, and consistency. Flag domain-specific claims as 'Needs SME verification'.
- **Author is defensive or resistant to feedback** — Lead with what works well. Frame changes as questions rather than mandates.
