## Quality Checks

- Cross-foot all financial statements; reconcile to MD&A and notes.

- Confirm units and rounding consistency across the filing.
- Confirm legal proceedings align with contingencies footnote.
- Confirm risk factor updates reflect only material changes since last filing.
- Confirm certification text matches required SEC form language.
- Validate EDGAR formatting and XBRL tagging.

## Guidelines

- Use company-specific, quantified explanations; avoid boilerplate.
- Mark uncertain regulatory citations with `[VERIFY]`.
- If an item has no material update, state explicitly or omit per form instructions.
- Do not incorporate SOX 906 exhibits into Securities Act registration statements [VERIFY].
- Apply plain English standards per Rule 421(d) of Regulation C [VERIFY].
- Coordinate with finance and legal to align disclosures with GAAP and SEC rules.
