# Commit Skill

Create commits that follow the repository's guidelines with proper versioning and changelog updates.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Changes

Run `git status` and `git diff` to understand:
- Which files have been modified
- Which plugins are affected
- Whether version files need updating
- Whether CHANGELOG needs updating

### Step 1.5: Build Verification

**When to run:** If any changed files are under `plugin/core/system/` or `plugin/fullstack-typescript/system/` (TypeScript source).

Run `npm run typecheck:plugin` and verify it passes. If there are type errors, fix them before proceeding — never commit code that doesn't compile.

**Skip conditions:**
- No changes under `plugin/core/system/` or `plugin/fullstack-typescript/system/`
- Changes are only to `.md` files, `.tasks/`, or non-TypeScript files

### Step 2: Version Check

For each affected plugin, check if version bump is needed:

**Files That REQUIRE Version Bump:**

| Directory/File | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `plugin/core/commands/` | All command `.md` files |
| `plugin/core/skills/` | All core skill `.md` files |
| `plugin/core/system/` | Core CLI system source files |
| `plugin/core/permissions/` | Permission configuration |
| `plugin/fullstack-typescript/agents/` | All agent `.md` files |
| `plugin/fullstack-typescript/skills/` | All tech pack skill `.md` files |
| `plugin/fullstack-typescript/system/` | Tech pack CLI system source files |
| `plugin/fullstack-typescript/templates/` | All template files |
| `plugin/.claude-plugin/` | Plugin manifest |

**Files That Do NOT Require Version Bump (Marketplace-Level):**

- Root `README.md`
- Root `CLAUDE.md`
- Root `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `changelog/` directory (changelog entries go in version-specific files)
- `.claude/skills/` (marketplace-level skills)
- `.gitignore`
- `.claudeignore`
- `plugin/tests/` (test files)

If version bump is needed, prompt for type:
- **PATCH** (x.x.Z): Bug fixes, small improvements
- **MINOR** (x.Y.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes

Update BOTH files:
- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

### Step 2.5: Manifest Validation

**When to run:** After updating version files, before proceeding to changelog.

If changes affect `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` or `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

1. Use the `manifest-validation` skill to validate both manifests
2. Fix any errors before proceeding

**Quick validation:**
```bash
# Verify versions match
jq -r '.version' plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
jq -r '.plugins[0].version' .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

**Skip conditions:**
- No changes to manifest files
- Version-only changes (version match is checked above)

### Step 3: Changelog Check

**Changelog structure:**
- `changelog/v{N}.md` - Per-major-version files (v1.md, v2.md, v3.md, v4.md, v5.md)

**Plugin changes**: Format `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` (versioned releases)
**Infrastructure changes**: Format `## Infrastructure - YYYY-MM-DD` (date-based)

**Update the version-specific file** (`changelog/v{major}.md`): Add entry at the top (after the header)

Entry format:

```markdown
## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### [Category]

- **[component]**: Description of change
  - Detail 1
  - Detail 2

### Rationale

Why this change was made (for significant changes).
```

**Categories:**
- `Added` - New features
- `Changed` - Changes to existing functionality
- `Enhanced` - Improvements to existing features
- `Fixed` - Bug fixes
- `Removed` - Removed features

**Determining the version file:**
- Extract major version from new version (e.g., `5.0.2` → `v5.md`)
- File path: `changelog/v{major}.md`

### Step 4: Documentation Check

**When to run:** If changes affect plugin functionality (commands, agents, skills, directory structure, workflows).

**What to check:**
1. Invoke the `docs-standards` agent to audit documentation against current plugin state
2. Review any inconsistencies found
3. Fix documentation issues before proceeding to commit

**Documentation files to verify:**
- `README.md` - Quick start, project structure, permissions
- `docs/getting-started.md` - Tutorial and structure diagrams
- `docs/commands.md` - Command references and examples
- `docs/workflows.md` - Workflow examples
- `docs/agents.md` - Agent descriptions
- `docs/components.md` - Component types

**Skip conditions:**
- Changes only affect test files
- Changes only affect marketplace-level skills (`.claude/skills/`)
- Changes only affect task management (`.tasks/`)
- Trivial changes (typos, formatting)

### Step 5: Task Status Check

**If changes involve `.tasks/` or are related to a tracked task:**

Use the `tasks` skill to ensure proper task status management. The tasks skill is authoritative for:
- Task lifecycle (inbox → speccing → planning → plan-review → implementing → reviewing → complete)
- Plan creation and approval workflows
- Automatic status transitions based on user actions

**Common scenarios:**

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Plan created and approved | Use `/tasks plan-review N` to move task to plan-review |
| Starting implementation | Use `/tasks implement N` to move task to implementing |
| Implementation complete | Use `/tasks review N` to move task to reviewing |
| Work fully done | Use `/tasks complete N` to mark task complete |

**Skip conditions:**
- Trivial changes (typos, formatting) don't need task tracking
- Changes already have correct task status

### Step 6: Generate Commit Message

**Task-context detection:** Before generating the message, check if the current branch is a feature branch for a task (e.g., `feature/task-19-*`). If so, and the task is in `4-implementing/` or `5-reviewing/`, prefix the commit message with the task reference:

```
Task #19: [Action] [Component]: [Description]
```

**Version bumps on feature branches:**
- **During implementation:** The final commit before moving to review must include the version bump and changelog entry (run Steps 2–3). Earlier implementation commits skip Steps 2–3.
- **During reviewing:** If the previous commit has NOT been pushed, amend it and update the changelog entry. If it HAS been pushed, create a new commit but amend the existing changelog entry in-place (update the version entry, do not create a new one). Never create a second version bump — only update the one created during implementation.

**Default format** (when not on a task feature branch):
```
[Action] [Component]: [Description], bump to [version]

```

**Actions:**
- **Add**: New feature or file
- **Fix**: Bug fix
- **Update**: Enhancement to existing feature
- **Remove**: Deletion
- **Refactor**: Code restructuring without behavior change
- **Docs**: Documentation only
- **Tasks**: Task management changes (adding, completing, updating tasks in `.tasks/`)

### Step 7: Review and Confirm

**Task-only commits (all changed files are under `.tasks/`):** Skip confirmation — proceed directly to Step 8.

**All other commits:** Present to the user:
- Summary of files to be committed
- Proposed commit message
- Version changes (if any)
- Changelog additions (if any)

**Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.**

### Step 8: Execute Commit

After confirmation (or immediately for task-only commits):
1. Stage all related files (code + version files + CHANGELOG)
2. Create the commit with the generated message
3. Display commit result

## Example

```
User: /commit

Agent: Analyzing changes...

Found changes in:
- plugin/fullstack-typescript/agents/backend-dev.md

Detected plugin: plugin (current version: 1.10.19)

Version files need updating:
- plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
- .claude-plugin/marketplace.json

What type of version bump?
1. PATCH (1.10.19 → 1.10.20) - Bug fixes, small improvements
2. MINOR (1.10.19 → 1.11.0) - New features
3. MAJOR (1.10.19 → 2.0.0) - Breaking changes

User: 1

Agent: Updating versions to 1.10.20...
✓ Updated plugin.json
✓ Updated marketplace.json

changelog/v1.md needs an entry for 1.10.20.

Proposed entry:

## [1.10.20] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed

- Updated backend-dev agent with improved error handling

Should I add this entry? (yes/edit/no)

## Quick Reference

```
Plugin TS changed? → Typecheck → Bump version → CHANGELOG → Check docs → Stage all → Commit
Plugin non-TS changed? → Bump version → CHANGELOG → Check docs → Stage all → Commit
Infrastructure file changed? → CHANGELOG → Stage all → Commit
Task-only changes? → Stage all → Commit (no confirmation needed)
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting version bump** - Always bump version for plugin file changes
2. **Mismatched versions** - plugin.json and marketplace.json must match
3. **Missing CHANGELOG** - Every change needs a CHANGELOG entry (versioned or Infrastructure)
4. **Wrong entry format** - Plugin changes use `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, infrastructure uses `## Infrastructure - YYYY-MM-DD`
5. **Wrong commit format** - Must include Co-Authored-By
6. **Staging incomplete** - Must include all version files in same commit
7. **Wrong date in CHANGELOG** - Use today's date
8. **Wrong changelog file** - Update only `changelog/v{N}.md` (no root CHANGELOG.md)
9. **Amending pushed commits** - NEVER amend commits that have been pushed to remote
10. **Multiple changelog entries per commit** - Each commit = one changelog entry. Split if needed
11. **Incorrect task status** - Use the `tasks` skill for all task status changes; don't manually edit task files
12. **Outdated documentation** - Plugin changes may require docs updates; run docs-standards agent to check

## One Commit = One Changelog Entry

**CRITICAL:** If your changes would result in multiple changelog entries, split them into separate commits.

**Example - Wrong:**
```
git add file1.md file2.md file3.md
git commit -m "Add feature A, fix bug B, refactor C"
# Results in 3 changelog entries in one commit - BAD
```

**Example - Correct:**
```
git add file1.md && git commit -m "Add feature A"
git add file2.md && git commit -m "Fix bug B"
git add file3.md && git commit -m "Refactor C"
# Each commit has one changelog entry - GOOD
```

**Why:** Clean git history, easier rollbacks, clearer blame, simpler code review.

## Amending vs New Commit

**CRITICAL:** Before amending, check if the commit has been pushed:

```bash
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
```

- **If the commit appears in this list** → Safe to amend (not pushed yet)
- **If the commit does NOT appear** → It's been pushed, create a NEW commit instead

**When a pushed commit needs fixing:**
1. Do NOT use `git commit --amend`
2. Create a new commit with a clear message explaining it fixes the previous commit
3. Example: `Fix: Correct typo in previous commit (a3614c1)`

## Verification Commands

Run these before committing:

```bash
# Check versions match
echo "Plugin version:"
cat plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json | grep version

echo "Marketplace version:"
cat .claude-plugin/marketplace.json | grep version

# Check changelog has entry for new version
head -20 changelog/v5.md  # Adjust version number as needed

# Check staged files
git status
```

## Changelog File Structure

The changelog is split by major version to stay within Claude's file size limits:

```
changelog/
├── README.md          # Compelling summary of all major versions (for evaluators)
├── v1.md              # All 1.x releases
├── v2.md              # All 2.x releases
├── v3.md              # All 3.x releases
├── v4.md              # All 4.x releases
├── v5.md              # All 5.x releases
└── v6.md              # All 6.x releases (current)
```

When adding a new entry:
1. Identify the major version (e.g., `5.1.0` → major version `5`)
2. Add entry to `changelog/v5.md` after the header section

When creating a **new major version**:
1. Create `changelog/v{N}.md`
2. Add a summary paragraph and table row to `changelog/README.md`
