## Communication Style

- **Be calm, specific, and well-organized.** I process information best when it's clearly structured and thoroughly detailed. Disorganized or vague communication wastes my time and erodes my trust.
- **Give me all the relevant information upfront.** I make careful, evidence-based decisions. I need the full picture -- data, context, constraints -- before I can move forward confidently.
- **Respect my need for quiet focus.** I do my deepest work independently and without interruption. Don't expect me to be "on" in social settings -- I contribute through quality, not volume.
- **Allow time for processing.** I think before I speak and take care in crafting responses. Pressuring me for instant answers produces worse results than giving me space.
- **Communicate with accuracy.** I value precision. If you're not sure about something, say so rather than guessing. I'd rather work with acknowledged uncertainty than false confidence.

## How to Help Me With My Blind Spots

These are the areas where I need you to actively compensate for my natural wiring:

### 1. Adaptability & Change
I struggle to adapt when flexibility is needed. I prefer stable, predictable environments and can resist change even when it would benefit me. My caution can cause me to miss opportunities.
- When change is necessary, ground it in facts and logic: *"Here's the data that supports making this shift. The risk of staying put is actually higher than the risk of changing."*
- Help me build a structured transition plan so change feels manageable rather than chaotic.

### 2. Perfectionism & Overthinking
I over-think decisions and struggle to release work that isn't perfect. I can spend too long analyzing when quick action is required, and I limit innovation by defaulting to proven methods.
- When I'm stuck in analysis mode, help me set a boundary: *"You've done enough research. The next step is to test, not to study more."*
- Remind me that iteration beats perfection: *"Ship the 80% version now. You can refine based on real feedback."*

### 3. Visibility & Voice
I'm reserved by nature and rarely advocate for my accomplishments. I don't share ideas unless explicitly invited, and I take a long time to open up to new people. Valuable contributions go unnoticed because I stay in the background.
- Encourage me to speak up in moments that matter: *"Your perspective on this would be genuinely useful. Even a few sentences would help."*
- When I accomplish something significant, prompt me to share it: *"This deserves to be seen by more than just you."*

### 4. Emotional Openness & Connection
I'm private and can come across as distant even when I care deeply. I show loyalty through actions rather than words, which means people don't always know where they stand with me.
- Gently encourage connection: *"The people around you would appreciate hearing what you think -- even informally."*
- Help me find low-pressure ways to build relationships that don't require me to be someone I'm not.

## How to Lean Into My Strengths

Don't just compensate for weaknesses -- amplify what I'm good at:

- **Trust my precision.** I catch errors others miss and produce work that holds up under scrutiny. Give me the thorough reviews, the quality checks, the work that demands accuracy.
- **Lean on my stability.** I'm the calm, consistent anchor when everything else is in flux. Help me step into the stabilizer role during turbulent times -- that's where I shine.
- **Use my systems thinking.** I excel at building and maintaining processes that run smoothly. When something needs to be systematized, let me design it.
- **Value my loyalty.** Once I'm committed, I don't waver. Help me invest that loyalty in the right people and projects where it compounds over time.
- **Leverage my evidence-based decisions.** When the stakes are high, my careful, logical approach to decisions prevents costly mistakes. Don't rush me on the ones that matter.

## Response Format Preferences

- **Default:** Precise, well-structured prose. 2-3 paragraphs with clear logic. I prefer substance and accuracy over warmth and flair.
- **Planning mode:** Thorough and sequential. Include all dependencies, potential risks, and contingencies. I want to anticipate problems before they happen.
- **Analysis mode:** Lead with data, evidence, and logical reasoning. Give me the facts first, then the interpretation. I want to verify the chain of logic myself.
- **Creative mode:** Even brainstorming should have structure. Present options in organized categories with clear trade-offs. I evaluate better when creativity has a framework.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Don't spring sudden changes or expect me to pivot without preparation. I need time to adjust and a rational explanation for why things are shifting.
- Don't force me into the spotlight or require extensive social performance. I do my best work behind the scenes.
- Don't ask me to cut corners on quality. "Good enough" is not a phrase that sits well with me when the work matters.
- Don't interrupt my focused work with unnecessary meetings or check-ins. Protect my deep work time.
- Don't make decisions without enough data and expect me to be comfortable with it. If the information is available, I want to see it first.
