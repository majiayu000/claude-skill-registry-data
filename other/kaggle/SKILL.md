# Kaggle

Build public-readable Kaggle notebook with evidence-backed problem profile, visual EDA, stage-level sanity checks, reproducible training, inference, and submission validation. Write notebook scripts only; use `implement` for packages or production modules and `research` for literature surveys.

## Input Schema

```json
{
  "competition": "required output slug",
  "context": "competition URL, pasted description, local dataset metadata, or existing notebook path",
  "problem_type": "optional classification|regression|segmentation|detection|tabular|time-series|point-cloud|mixed",
  "mode": "full|eda-only|inference-only",
  "offline_setup": "optional boolean",
  "resume": "optional existing Jupytext .py path",
  "keep": "optional user-specified content that must survive regeneration",
  "done_when": "the grounded notebook is written, structurally verified, and recorded in a validated result artifact"
}
```

Default `mode` to `full`. Resolve mode behavior and output paths only through `references/composition.md`.

## Workflow

### 01: Create the run and normalize input

Create `.reports/codex/kaggle/<timestamp>/` and keep active plan current. Record normalized inputs in `profile.md`.

- Require filesystem-safe lowercase slug containing only letters, digits, and hyphens.
- Reject conflicting or unsupported mode inputs.
- Require `resume` to exist, be readable, and use Jupytext cell markers.
- Treat unknown options as blocking until user confirms whether to ignore them.
- Create `.experiments/kaggle/` only after inputs pass validation.

### 02: Gather evidence before choosing an approach

Prefer authenticated `kaggle` CLI over competition page for anything CLI can read. Competition pages are login-walled and often return partial content; CLI reads real file names, sizes, and actual sample submission.

Apply full networked CLI approval and denial contract in `../../shared/native-skill-contract.md` to complete owning command for every `kaggle` invocation, including probes, help, listings, and downloads. The operation-specific brief is: `Action and purpose`: read competition metadata or download selected Kaggle data; `External capability`: Kaggle network read or download; `Credential behavior`: use configured Kaggle CLI credentials without reading, creating, or authenticating them; `Filesystem and worktree effects`: write evidence profile and, after validation, selected data under `.experiments/kaggle/`; `Retry policy and safe denial outcome`: stop turn on denial and use page or user-supplied evidence only when requested mode permits degraded grounding. The task authorizes requesting runtime permission, not bypassing it. Kaggle CLI installation and authentication remain user-owned; never install or authenticate from this workflow.

**CLI probe.** `command -v kaggle`, then `kaggle competitions list -p 1` — succeeds only with valid credentials, and needs no rules acceptance, so it separates auth failure from rules failure. Record resulting state in `profile.md` as `ready`, `unauthorized`, or `absent`. Absence is never fatal: fall back to page and user-supplied facts, and record degraded grounding as residual limit.

- `absent` — do not install it. Ask the user to install and authenticate the Kaggle CLI, then rerun the workflow; use page or user-supplied evidence only when the requested mode can tolerate degraded grounding.
- `unauthorized` — instruct user to create token at `https://www.kaggle.com/settings` (API → Create New Token), place it at `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` with `chmod 600`, or export `KAGGLE_USERNAME`/`KAGGLE_KEY`. Never fabricate or request pasted token.

**Credential secrecy — hard constraint.** The token value never enters this run's context, any artifact, or any delegated agent's prompt. Forbidden regardless of who asks: reading `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` by any tool, `cat`/`head`/`grep`/`jq` on it, `kaggle config view`, `env | grep KAGGLE`, echoing `$KAGGLE_KEY`/`$KAGGLE_API_TOKEN`, quoting pasted token back, or writing any of it into notebook cell, `profile.md`, gate log, or result artifact. The `kaggle` binary reads credentials from environment on its own — workflow needs CLI to work, never secret's value. Verify auth by exit code alone (`kaggle competitions list -p 1 >/dev/null 2>&1`), never by inspecting file. A token pasted into chat is compromised: do not repeat it, and tell user to rotate it.

**CLI queries.** Competition slug is positional; `-v` means CSV output, not verbose. Read `kaggle competitions --help` or `kaggle datasets --help` for anything beyond these — flag surface shifts between CLI releases, so never invent one.

- `kaggle competitions files <slug> -v --page-size 200` — file names and sizes.
- `kaggle competitions leaderboard <slug> -s -v` — achievable score range for metric.
- `kaggle competitions download <slug> -f sample_submission.csv -p .experiments/kaggle/data/<slug>/ -q` — real submission header. Single-file downloads may arrive zipped; unzip before reading.
- `kaggle datasets list -s "<term>" -v` / `kaggle datasets files <owner>/<name> -v` / `kaggle datasets download <owner>/<name> --unzip` — only when competition permits external data.

File listing works without joining competition; rules acceptance gates downloads. On a `403` or any "accept the rules" error, direct user to `https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/<slug>/rules` — CLI cannot accept them — and treat affected facts as ungrounded until confirmed. A `404` instead means malformed slug: `kaggle competitions list -v` returns full URLs in `ref`, so pass only last path segment, and verify with `kaggle competitions list -s "<term>" -v`.

Never download full competition or dataset archive unprompted — list files with sizes first and ask. Local downloads do not change notebook path constants; `PATH_DATASET` stays Kaggle-runtime path unless user states notebook runs locally.

Inspect in parallel where available:

- `.temp/kaggle-style-distill.md` for local notebook style.
- The requested competition page for problem narrative and metric definition — parts CLI does not expose. Browse exact page when URL is supplied; quote only short supporting text and record access failures.
- The resume file and `.experiments/kaggle/*.py` for established local structure.
- `resources/competitors/**/*.{ipynb,py}` for comparable preprocessing, model, augmentation, and submission patterns.
- Local data dictionaries, sample submission files, schemas, and directory listings supplied by user.

Write source-backed table in `profile.md`:

| Fact | Value | Source |
| -- | -- | -- |
| problem type | — | user, fetched URL, local file, or explicit inference from another row |
| input modality | — | — |
| target/output format | — | — |
| evaluation metric and direction | — | — |
| data schema and paths | — | — |
| submission schema | — | — |

Cite `kaggle competitions files`, `kaggle competitions download`, or `kaggle datasets files` by name as source when CLI supplied row. CLI evidence outranks fetched page for file names, data schema, and submission format; page stays authoritative for problem narrative and metric definition.

Never invent competition-specific columns, paths, labels, metrics, or submission formats. Ask for missing input modality, metric, and submission format before generation. If user elects to continue without them, use conspicuous placeholders and list every placeholder as unresolved limit.

### 03: Select the problem profile

Choose simplest justified model family:

| Profile | Preferred starting point |
| -- | -- |
| image classification/regression | `timm` backbone; PyTorch Lightning for neural training |
| 2D segmentation | `segmentation_models_pytorch`; MONAI for 3D |
| detection | `torchvision.models.detection` or verified installed detector API |
| tabular | scikit-learn pipeline or XGBoost; Lightning only for neural models |
| time series | feature baseline plus XGBoost, or Lightning sequence model |
| point cloud | verified MONAI/PyTorch3D-compatible path with Lightning |

Use PyTorch Lightning whenever neural training loop is needed. Pure scikit-learn or XGBoost pipelines do not need Lightning. Record selected model, alternatives rejected, metric direction, and package/API evidence in `profile.md`. Verify current third-party APIs from installed package metadata or current primary documentation; do not rely on reference snippets when versions differ.

### 04: Resolve the composition

Read `references/composition.md` completely and execute selected row.

Keep ownership strict: composition owns mode routing; section contracts own notebook behavior; style rules own presentation.

### 05: Generate or resume the notebook

Write notebook directly; do not delegate generation to external runner or assume Foundry agent exists.

- Preserve all requested `keep` content and unrelated resume-file content.
- Use `# %%` and `# %% [markdown]` cell boundaries.

Do not distill helpers into package during notebook run. Offer package extraction only as separate `implement` task after baseline notebook passes.

### 06: Verify the generated artifact

Record verification in `profile.md` and gate logs.

1. Confirm output exists, is non-empty, starts with `# %% [markdown]`, and contains only recognized cell markers.
2. Confirm all sections required by selected mode are present and prohibited sections are absent.
3. Scan for unresolved angle-bracket placeholders, `TODO`, guessed schema, stale external-runner vocabulary, bare shell lines, deprecated `torch.cuda.amp`, and duplicate global helper blocks.
4. Confirm every grounded field used in code matches `profile.md` and sample submission/schema evidence.
5. If `jupytext` is installed, convert to temporary notebook and fail on conversion errors. Otherwise record missing optional conversion check as residual limit.
6. Run executable smoke checks that do not require unavailable Kaggle data. Never claim model training, inference, or submission execution unless it actually ran.
7. Review focused diff and run `git diff --check` without modifying unrelated changes.
8. Mechanically scan every `# %% [markdown]` cell for bare `#`/`##`/... heading-spacer line (`../../shared/notebook-style.md` §Markdown blank lines) — prose compliance alone proved insufficient in practice; clear each hit to true blank line before recording verification.

### 07: Run gates and publish the result artifact

Follow `../../shared/helper-cli-contract.md` and inspect helper `--help` before invocation.

- `tests`: structural/content checks plus Jupytext conversion when available.
- `review`: request conformance, evidence/profile consistency, focused diff, and `git diff --check`.
- `lint`, `format`, and `types`: use applicable project/notebook commands; otherwise provide precise not-applicable reasons because Jupytext magics are not ordinary Python syntax.
- Set `KAGGLE_METADATA` with mode, output path, grounded sources, unresolved placeholders, confidence recovery, and confidence gap closures.
- Write candidate from `result-template.json`, validate it with shared validator as `kaggle`, and promote only validated candidate to `result.json`.

## Fail-Fast Rules

01. Missing or unsafe competition slug => fail before writing.
02. Conflicting modes or missing resume path => fail before writing.
03. Unknown input modality, metric, or submission format without explicit placeholder approval => stop and ask.
04. Competition-specific claim without cited user, local, fetched, or `kaggle` CLI source => fail grounding gate.
05. Referenced composition, section contract, or style file missing or unreadable => fail before generation.
06. Generated output missing required sections, containing forbidden sections, or failing cell-marker checks => fail.
07. Claimed runtime success without executed evidence => fail review.
08. Missing `profile.md`, gate evidence, or validated result artifact => fail.
09. Full competition or dataset archive downloaded without listing file sizes and asking first => fail.
10. A required main-path notebook action (data load, sample display, chart, lens, training, inference, or submission validation) guarded by `try`/`except`, `if`/`else`, or silent skip => fail. Assert its preconditions immediately before action and let unexpected errors stop notebook.

## Quality Gates

Required:

- `tests`: composition integrity, notebook structure, mode sections, placeholder disclosure, and optional Jupytext conversion.
- `review`: grounding table, output/schema consistency, request constraints, focused diff, and clean `git diff --check`.
- `artifact`: `profile.md`, gate logs, and result JSON pass shared `kaggle` validator.

Conditional:

- `lint`, `format`, and `types`: run when compatible notebook-aware commands exist; otherwise record explicit not-applicable reasons.
- Runtime data/model checks: required only when requested data and dependencies are locally available.

Pass only when all applicable gates pass, no grounded fields are silently guessed, and confidence is at least `0.85` with objective evidence and residual limits recorded.

## Calibration Hooks

Review calibration when this workflow changes grounding, mode routing, model selection, network approval, or notebook acceptance. Relevant cases cover invented competition schema, missing submission validation, full-mode sections leaking into EDA-only mode, inference notebooks retraining, unsupported runtime-success claims, and networked CLI owning-command approval. If calibration files are intentionally unchanged, explain why in manage/review artifact.

## Output Contract

Before writing result candidate, follow `../../shared/final-handoff-contract.md`: render and bind `final-handoff.json`, `final.md`, and `final-handoff.validation.json`; after both validators and promotion pass, emit `final.md` verbatim.

Write notebook under `.experiments/kaggle/` and canonical run result under `.reports/codex/kaggle/<timestamp>/result.json`. Use common fields and confidence metadata from `../../shared/quality-gates.md`; `result-template.json` is minimum payload shape.

Final chat follows shared ordered frame. `Outcome` is `pass`, `fail`, `partial`, or `blocked` and states whether notebook was produced and grounded. `Results` has one produced or resumed notebook per row and exactly `Artifact | Mode | Verification | Runtime limit`. Apply shared `Verification`, `Remaining`, `Next steps`, `Confidence`, and supplemental `Artifact` rules; include grounding, structural, conversion, smoke, and review checks plus every placeholder, grounding gap, and runtime limit.
