# Time Blocker

The Time Blocker skill helps you protect and optimize your calendar using time blocking strategies—the practice of scheduling every hour of your day to ensure important work gets done. Rather than letting your calendar fill reactively with meetings and interruptions, this skill helps you proactively design your ideal week.

This skill applies principles from Cal Newport's "Deep Work," Peter Drucker's effectiveness teachings, and modern async work practices to help you create a calendar that reflects your priorities. It distinguishes between maker time (long uninterrupted blocks) and manager time (scheduled meetings), and helps you protect the former while optimizing the latter.

The tool generates time block templates, helps you schedule recurring focus blocks, and provides strategies for defending your calendar against the tyranny of the urgent.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Weekly Time Block Design
1. **Commitment Mapping**: Identifies all fixed obligations (meetings, appointments)
2. **Priority Identification**: Determines 1-3 most important focus areas
3. **Block Allocation**: Creates time blocks for deep work, admin, meetings
4. **Energy Alignment**: Matches block types to your energy patterns
5. **Buffer Building**: Adds transition time and flex blocks
6. **Calendar Creation**: Generates specific calendar entries
7. **Protection Strategy**: Defines rules for defending blocked time

### Workflow 2: Daily Time Block Planning
Creates detailed day-level blocks:
1. Reviews existing commitments
2. Allocates remaining time to priorities
3. Creates themed blocks (email, deep work, meetings)
4. Builds in breaks and transitions
5. Sets clear start/stop times

### Workflow 3: Focus Block Protection
Strategies to defend deep work time:
1. **Proactive Scheduling**: Block time before others can claim it
2. **Meeting Batching**: Cluster meetings to preserve uninterrupted blocks
3. **Communication Guidelines**: Set expectations for response times
4. **Decline Scripts**: Templates for protecting blocked time
5. **Emergency Protocols**: Define what justifies interruption

### Workflow 4: Block Review & Optimization
Weekly analysis to improve blocking strategy:
1. **Adherence Check**: How often did you use blocks as planned?
2. **Interruption Analysis**: What broke the blocks?
3. **Output Assessment**: Did blocks produce expected results?
4. **Adjustment Planning**: Refine duration, timing, or protection strategies

## Time Blocking Frameworks

### The Ideal Week Template
Design recurring weekly structure:
```
MONDAY: Deep Work Day
09:00-12:00 | Deep Work Block - [Primary Project]
12:00-13:00 | Lunch & Movement
13:00-15:00 | Deep Work Block - [Secondary Project]
15:00-16:00 | Admin & Email
16:00-17:00 | Planning & Review

TUESDAY: Collaboration Day
09:00-10:00 | Pre-meeting Prep
10:00-12:00 | Team Meetings
12:00-13:00 | Lunch
13:00-15:00 | Partner/Client Meetings
15:00-17:00 | Follow-up & Documentation

WEDNESDAY: Deep Work Day
[Similar to Monday]

THURSDAY: Mixed Day
09:00-11:00 | Deep Work Block
11:00-12:00 | 1:1 Meetings
12:00-13:00 | Lunch

15:00-17:00 | Learning & Development
```

### Block Types

**Deep Work Blocks** (2-4 hours)
- No meetings, no interruptions
- Phone on Do Not Disturb
- Email/Slack closed
- Single-task focus
- Cognitively demanding work

**Shallow Work Blocks** (1-2 hours)
- Email processing
- Admin tasks
- Scheduling
- Expense reports
- Routine communications

**Meeting Blocks** (varies)
- Batch meetings together
- Leave buffer between
- Theme by type if possible
- Always have agenda

**Buffer Blocks** (30-60 min)
- Flex time for overflow
- Catch-up on small tasks
- Transition between block types
- Handle unexpected urgent items

**Break Blocks** (15-30 min)
- True rest, not "quick tasks"
- Movement or meditation
- Not optional—schedule them

**Creative Blocks** (1-2 hours)
- Exploration, not execution
- Experimentation
- Learning new skills
- Strategic thinking

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command/Trigger |
|--------|-----------------|

| Daily blocking | "block today's time" |
| Protect focus time | "help me protect my calendar" |
| Meeting batching | "batch my meetings" |
| Review blocks | "review my time blocks" |
| Create focus block | "schedule deep work" |
| Add buffer time | "add buffer blocks" |
| Template generation | "create blocking template" |

## Blocking Strategies

### Time Block Categories by Work Type

**Knowledge Workers**
- 40% Deep Work (writing, analysis, strategy)
- 30% Collaboration (meetings, reviews)
- 20% Shallow Work (email, admin)
- 10% Buffer/Flex

**Managers**
- 30% Deep Work (planning, decision-making)
- 50% Collaboration (meetings, coaching)
- 10% Shallow Work
- 10% Buffer/Flex

**Creatives**
- 60% Deep Work (creation, ideation)
- 20% Collaboration (feedback, iteration)
- 10% Shallow Work
- 10% Buffer/Flex

### Maker vs. Manager Schedule

**Maker Schedule**
- Long uninterrupted blocks (minimum 3 hours)
- Meetings only on designated days
- Protects morning peak energy
- Batches all interruptions

**Manager Schedule**
- Blocks in 1-hour increments
- Meetings throughout the week
- Preserves some maker blocks
- More flexible, more reactive

**Hybrid Approach**
- Maker mornings, manager afternoons
- Maker days (Mon/Wed/Fri) + Manager days (Tue/Thu)
- Quarterly flip between modes

## Best Practices

- **Block time before it gets claimed** - Schedule your priorities first, meetings second
- **Batch similar tasks** - Context switching kills productivity
- **Protect morning hours** - Your best thinking happens early
- **Theme your days** - Monday for deep work, Tuesday for meetings, etc.
- **Schedule buffer time** - Plans without buffers always fail
- **Make blocks visible** - Put them on your shared calendar
- **Defend ruthlessly** - "I have a commitment at that time" (to yourself)
- **Include breaks** - Humans aren't machines
- **Plan the night before** - Don't decide what to do during your block
- **Start and stop on time** - Parkinson's Law is real
- **Review weekly** - Adjust based on what worked
- **Communicate your system** - Help others understand your availability patterns
- **Use calendar descriptions** - Note what you'll work on in each block
- **Color code blocks** - Visual distinction between block types
- **Be realistic** - Don't block 12 hours of deep work per day

## Defense Strategies

### Protecting Deep Work Blocks

**When someone wants to meet during your blocked time:**
- "I have a commitment then. I have availability [other time]."
- "I'm blocking that time for [project]. Could we do [alternative]?"
- "I protect mornings for deep work. Afternoons work better for me."

**Setting expectations:**
- Email auto-responder: "I check email twice daily at 12pm and 4pm"
- Slack status: "Deep work until 12pm, will respond after"
- Team agreement: "No meetings before 11am on Mondays"

**Emergency protocols:**
- Define what constitutes an emergency
- Provide alternative contact for urgent issues
- Allow specific people to interrupt (with high bar)

### Declining Meeting Requests

**The Deflection:**
"Does this require my participation? [Colleague] might be better suited."

**The Async Alternative:**
"Could we handle this via email/doc instead? I'm trying to preserve focused work time."

**The Counter-Offer:**
"I'm booked then. I have time [specific alternative times]."

**The Hard No:**
"I need to decline—I'm protecting that time for [priority]. Thanks for understanding."

## Integration Points

This skill works well with:
- **Daily Planner**: Implement daily plans through time blocking
- **Goal Setter**: Allocate blocks to goal-related work
- **Focus Timer**: Use Pomodoro within deep work blocks
- **Habit Tracker**: Schedule habit practice in dedicated blocks
- **Decision Helper**: Decide where to allocate discretionary time

## Example Time Blocking Session

**User**: "block my time"

**Skill Response**:
"Let's design your ideal week with intentional time blocks. This will help you protect what matters and say no to what doesn't.

**Step 1: Fixed Commitments**
First, what's already non-negotiable in your week?
- Regular meetings you can't move?
- Standing appointments?
- Commute times?
- Non-work commitments?

List your fixed time commitments so we can block around them."

**User**: "Team standup Monday/Wednesday 9-9:30am, 1:1s Thursday 2-4pm, family dinner 6pm daily"

**Skill Response**:
"Got it. So you have:
- Mon/Wed mornings partially blocked
- Thursday afternoons blocked
- Hard stop at 6pm daily

**Step 2: Your Best Thinking Time**
When are you most mentally sharp? When does deep work feel easiest?
- Morning person (peak 8am-noon)?
- Afternoon person (peak 1-5pm)?
- Night owl (peak after 6pm)?

This matters—we'll protect your peak hours for your most important work."
