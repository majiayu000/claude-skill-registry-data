## Scopes and duplicate invariant

Skill discovery is consumer-specific. Codex uses `$HOME/.agents/skills` for user skills,
scans `.agents/skills` from CWD to repo root, and follows symlinks. Other agents use the
paths in `scripts/agents.py`; plugins add a separately managed namespaced layer.

Maintain one active implementation of a frontmatter `name` per consumer topology. Aliases
to one real directory are not independent copies; identical agent-specific replicas may be
necessary, but divergent global/repo/plugin copies require a canonical-source decision.
Read [skill-deduplication.md](references/skill-deduplication.md) before installing,
deduplicating, migrating, or resolving plugin-vs-standalone conflicts.

## Operations

### List Skills

```bash
python3 scripts/list_skills.py              # All skills
python3 scripts/list_skills.py -s user      # User scope only
python3 scripts/list_skills.py -f json      # JSON output
```

### Show Skill Details

```bash
python3 scripts/show_skill.py <name>           # Basic info
python3 scripts/show_skill.py <name> --files   # Include file listing
python3 scripts/show_skill.py <name> -f json   # JSON output
```

### Review Skill

Audits a skill against best practices and suggests improvements:

```bash
python3 scripts/review_skill.py <name>         # Review with text output
python3 scripts/review_skill.py <name> -f json # JSON output for programmatic use
```

**Checks performed:**
- Name format (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars, gerund form)
- Name matches directory name
- Description quality (triggers, negative triggers, third person, specificity)
- XML angle brackets in frontmatter (security)
- Forbidden docs files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- Body length (warns if >500 lines)
- **Token footprint** (300-2000 tokens target per SkillOpt; warns at 2000, penalises at 4000)
- **Procedurality** (instance-specific markers — filenames, literal numbers, task references — should be rare)
- **Patch-friendliness** (anchor density: `##`/`###` headings + `**Label:**` markers needed for reliable `insert_after` edits)
- **Slow-update section integrity** (`<!-- SLOW_UPDATE_START -->` / `<!-- SLOW_UPDATE_END -->` markers must be balanced and unnested)
- Time-sensitive content
- Path format (no Windows backslashes)
- Reference depth (should be one level)
- Table of contents for long files

**After reviewing:** Read the skill's SKILL.md and apply the suggested fixes directly.

### Delete Skill

**CRITICAL**: Always use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm before deleting: "Are you sure you want to delete the skill '[name]'? This cannot be undone."

```bash
python3 scripts/delete_skill.py <name>              # Claude Code only, with confirmation
python3 scripts/delete_skill.py <name> --force      # Skip confirmation prompt
python3 scripts/delete_skill.py <name> -s project   # Target specific scope
python3 scripts/delete_skill.py <name> -a cursor    # Delete from specific agent
python3 scripts/delete_skill.py <name> --all-agents --force  # Delete from all agents
```

**Multi-agent deletion:** Skills installed via `npx skills add` may exist in multiple agent directories. The default mode (no flags) deletes from Claude Code only and warns if copies remain in other agents. Use `--all-agents` to delete from every detected agent at once.

For ecosystem-installed skills, prefer `npx skills remove <name> -g -y` first. Use `delete_skill.py --all-agents` as fallback for manual cleanup.

### Move Skill

```bash
python3 scripts/move_skill.py <name> user      # Project → User (personal)
python3 scripts/move_skill.py <name> project   # User → Project (share with team)
python3 scripts/move_skill.py <name> user -f   # Overwrite if exists
```

### Modify Skill

1. Run `python3 scripts/show_skill.py <name>` to locate it
2. Edit SKILL.md directly at the returned path

### Create New Skill

Use the `/skill-creator` skill for guided creation with proper structure.

## Optimize a Skill (SkillOpt-style)

Treat a skill as a **trainable text artefact**: bounded edits + held-out validation gate + rejected-edit buffer + epoch-wise slow update. See [references/skill-optimization.md](references/skill-optimization.md) for the full method (Microsoft, arXiv 2605.23904, May 2026).

**When to use this loop:**
- Skill already exists and underperforms on a measurable task set
- You have (or can write) a verifier — exact-match, scored output, or LLM judge
- You can produce 20-100 representative tasks with reference answers

**When NOT to use:**
- Task has no measurable success signal — bounded text optimisation needs a gate
- Creating a skill from scratch — write a v0 with `/skill-creator` first
- Only 1-5 tasks available — the loop needs evidence batches

### Run the loop

```bash
# 1. Dry-run to see the plan (splits, schedule, prompt previews)
python3 scripts/optimize_skill.py <name> \
    --tasks tasks.jsonl --epochs 4 --edit-budget 4 \
    --output-dir runs/r1 --dry-run

# 2. Real run
python3 scripts/optimize_skill.py <name> \
    --tasks tasks.jsonl --output-dir runs/r1 \
    --optimizer-cmd "claude -p --model claude-opus-4-7" \
    --target-cmd  "claude -p --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"

# 3. Inspect
cat runs/r1/optimization_report.md
python3 scripts/diff_skill_versions.py <name> --files \
    runs/r1/initial_skill.md runs/r1/best_skill.md --format stats
```

The loop produces `best_skill.md`, `optimization_report.md`, `edit_apply_report.json`, `rejected_buffer.json`, and `meta_skill.json` (optimiser-side only — not shipped).

### Manual-edit audit trail

For edits made outside the loop (hand-tweaks, bug-fix follow-ups), keep a lightweight log:

```bash
# After saving an edit
python3 scripts/log_skill_edit.py <name> \
    --reason "tightened insert_after target" \
    --source from-bug --ref "issue #42" --snapshot

python3 scripts/log_skill_edit.py <name> --list --since 30d
python3 scripts/diff_skill_versions.py <name> --log
```

`--snapshot` saves a copy under `<skill>/.skill_snapshots/SKILL.<sha8>.md` so the diff helper can show actual content, not just hashes.

### Protected slow-update section

A skill that gets optimised iteratively should include a markup-fenced region for longitudinal guidance:

```markdown
<!-- SLOW_UPDATE_START -->
<!-- This block is managed by the epoch-boundary slow-update process.
     Step-level edits never modify it. -->
<!-- SLOW_UPDATE_END -->
```

`scripts/review_skill.py` flags unbalanced or nested markers. `scripts/optimize_skill.py` refuses to apply step-level edits that target content inside this region.

### Trigger and transfer tests

```bash
# Auto-generate candidate trigger cases from the skill's description
python3 scripts/trigger_test.py <name> --generate > cases.yaml
# Curate, then run
python3 scripts/trigger_test.py <name> --cases cases.yaml --threshold 0.8

# Verify skill lands and parses in other agents
python3 scripts/transfer_test.py <name> --all --scope global
```

### Rich grading: assertions verifier

Pass `--verifier assertions` to grade each rollout against declarative `assertions[]` from `tasks.jsonl`. The grader returns per-assertion pass/fail with evidence, extracted claims, AND a **critique of the assertions themselves** (`eval_feedback`) — a meta layer that flags weak or non-discriminating checks. `optimization_report.md` aggregates these into an "Assertion critique" section.

```json
// tasks.jsonl entry for --verifier assertions
{"id":"t1","prompt":"...","assertions":["The output is a valid JSON array","Each item has a name field"]}
```

### Variance: multi-run per task

Pass `--runs-per-task 3` to run each task N times. `rollouts.jsonl` records `score_mean` and `score_stddev`; validation gate uses the mean. Use this when the verifier is noisy or the agent's behaviour is non-deterministic.

### Blind A/B comparison

Independent verdict on whether `best_skill.md` is actually better than `initial_skill.md` — important because the SkillOpt gate uses the same verifier that proposed the edits, which can be self-confirming.

```bash
python3 scripts/blind_comparator.py \
    --skill-a runs/r1/initial_skill.md \
    --skill-b runs/r1/best_skill.md \
    --tasks tasks.jsonl \
    --output-dir cmp/r1
```

Per task: both skills run on the same prompt, outputs presented as X/Y to an independent judge with randomised labels. Aggregated to `comparison_report.{json,md}`.

### HTML viewer for a run

```bash
python3 scripts/eval_viewer.py runs/r1                    # opens in browser
python3 scripts/eval_viewer.py runs/r1 runs/r2 --compare  # side-by-side
```

Single-page static HTML: per-epoch chart, accepted/rejected edit timelines, slow-update history, per-task rollouts with grading, initial→best diff. No JS / CSS deps.

## Discover & Install Skills

Search and install skills from the open agent skills ecosystem via the [Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/add-skill) (`npx skills`). Browse at [skills.sh](https://skills.sh).

### Find Skills

```bash
npx skills find [query]              # Interactive search
npx skills find react performance    # Keyword search
npx skills find pr review            # Search by task
```

### Install from Ecosystem

**Mandatory preflight:** determine the candidate frontmatter `name` and run the duplicate
auditor before installation. If the name exists, update/reuse the canonical copy instead.
For intentional cross-agent replicas, document the need and use
`install_skill.py --allow-duplicate-name` only after review.

For a locally maintained canonical source, prefer `install_skill.py --link`: every agent
sees the same real directory and future edits cannot make copied installs drift. Use a copy
only when the consumer cannot follow symlinks or deliberately needs an isolated snapshot.

```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo@skill> -g -y    # Install globally, skip prompts
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills@vercel-react-best-practices -g -y
```

### List Ecosystem Skills

```bash
npx skills list                      # List all installed ecosystem skills
npx skills ls                        # Alias
npx skills list -g                   # Global skills only
npx skills list -a cursor            # Skills for a specific agent
```

### Remove Ecosystem Skills

Uninstalls skills installed via `npx skills add`. For locally-created skills, use `python3 scripts/delete_skill.py` instead.

**CRITICAL**: Always confirm with the user before removing.

```bash
npx skills remove <name> -g -y       # Remove a global skill, skip prompt
npx skills rm <name>                 # Alias, with confirmation prompt
npx skills remove <name> -a cursor   # Remove from specific agent
npx skills remove --all -g -y        # Remove all global ecosystem skills
```

### Check & Update

```bash
npx skills check                     # Check for available updates
npx skills update                    # Update all installed skills
```

Treat `npx skills check` as potentially mutating: some CLI versions update during `check`,
and `check --help` may enter the same workflow. Do not run it for read-only inspection unless
the user already authorized updates. Prefer repository HEAD, manager lock metadata, and
installed hashes for a read-only freshness comparison. After any managed update, rerun the
duplicate audit because stale lock entries can recreate removed copies.

### When to Search

Use `npx skills find` when the user:
- Asks "how do I do X" where X is a common task
- Says "find a skill for X" or "is there a skill for X"
- Wants specialized capabilities (design, testing, deployment, etc.)

### Common Search Categories

| Category | Example queries |
|----------|----------------|
| Web Dev | react, nextjs, typescript, tailwind |
| Testing | testing, jest, playwright, e2e |
| DevOps | deploy, docker, kubernetes, ci-cd |
| Docs | docs, readme, changelog, api-docs |
| Quality | review, lint, refactor, best-practices |
| Design | ui, ux, design-system, accessibility |
| Productivity | workflow, automation, git |

### Review & Compare Results

**Always suggest reviewing found skills after a search.** After presenting search results, ask the user if they'd like you to review and compare the top candidates before installing.

When there are 2+ results, proactively offer to fetch and assess the top candidates. This is agent-driven — use WebFetch on `https://skills.sh/<owner>/<repo>/<skill>` pages and apply judgment.

**Always offer review when:**
- Any search returns results (ask: "Want me to review these skills before you install?")
- 3+ results returned — review is especially valuable
- Multiple results with similar names or overlapping descriptions
- User asks to compare, review, evaluate, or pick the best
- A result has suspicious metrics (niche topic with very high installs)

**Process:**
1. Present the search results summary first
2. Ask the user if they want you to review/compare the top candidates
3. If yes: fetch skills.sh pages for top 3-6 candidates
4. Evaluate quality signals: install count, agent distribution, age, description, relevance, overlap with installed skills
5. Assign verdict: Recommended / Consider / Skip
6. Present ranked summary with 1-2 sentence assessments

See [references/remote-skill-assessment.md](references/remote-skill-assessment.md) for the full assessment framework including red flags and scoring signals.

### No Results

If no skills found: offer to help directly, then suggest `npx skills init <name>` to create a custom skill.

## Multi-Agent Operations

Manage skills across 40 supported AI coding agents. Full registry at [skills.sh](https://skills.sh).

### Supported agents

The authoritative registry of supported agents and discovery paths is
`scripts/agents.py`. Use `detect_agents.py --all` to print it instead of copying the table
into instructions where paths become stale.

### Detect Installed Agents

```bash
python3 scripts/detect_agents.py              # List detected agents
python3 scripts/detect_agents.py --all        # Show all supported agents
python3 scripts/detect_agents.py -f json      # JSON output
```

### List Skills for Any Agent

```bash
python3 scripts/list_agent_skills.py --agent cursor           # Single agent
python3 scripts/list_agent_skills.py --agent goose -s global  # Specific scope
python3 scripts/list_agent_skills.py --all                    # All detected agents
python3 scripts/list_agent_skills.py --agent amp -f json      # JSON output
```

### Install Skill to Agents

```bash
python3 scripts/install_skill.py /path/to/skill --agent cursor              # Single agent
python3 scripts/install_skill.py /path/to/skill --agent cursor --agent amp  # Multiple agents
python3 scripts/install_skill.py /path/to/skill --all                       # All detected
python3 scripts/install_skill.py /path/to/skill --agent goose -s global     # Global scope
python3 scripts/install_skill.py /path/to/skill --agent cursor --force      # Overwrite
python3 scripts/install_skill.py /path/to/skill --agent cursor --link --allow-duplicate-name  # Canonical alias
```

### Copy Skill Between Agents

```bash
python3 scripts/copy_skill.py my-skill --from claude-code --to cursor
python3 scripts/copy_skill.py my-skill --from claude-code --to cursor --to-scope global
python3 scripts/copy_skill.py my-skill --from claude-code --from-scope project --to amp
python3 scripts/copy_skill.py my-skill --from claude-code --to cursor --force
```

### Move Skill Between Agents

```bash
python3 scripts/move_skill_agent.py my-skill --from claude-code --to cursor
python3 scripts/move_skill_agent.py my-skill --from claude-code --to goose --force
```

## Important Notes

- **Restart required for new top-level dirs**: Creating a top-level `skills/` directory that did not exist when the session started requires restarting Claude Code so the directory can be watched
- **Live change detection (Claude Code, 2026)**: Adding, editing, or removing a skill under `~/.claude/skills/`, project `.claude/skills/`, or `.claude/skills/` inside an `--add-dir` directory takes effect within the current Claude Code session — no restart needed
- **Edits are immediate**: Changes to existing skill content work without restart
- **Agent detection**: Uses config directory presence to detect installed agents
- **Install once per discovery topology**: prefer one shared canonical root or symlink. Create agent-specific replicas only for consumers that cannot read that root, and audit after replication.
- **Custom commands have merged into skills (Claude Code, 2026)**: A file at `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` both create `/deploy`. Existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working; skills add a directory for supporting files, frontmatter, and auto-invocation.
- **Plugin skills are namespaced** as `plugin-name:skill-name` and cannot conflict with user/project skills

## OpenCode-specific notes

OpenCode (anomalyco/opencode v1.14.x) reads skills from **multiple compatible locations** in addition to its native paths:

- Project: `.opencode/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/` — all loaded
- Global: `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/` — all loaded
- Walks up from CWD to the git worktree root, collecting skills along the way

This means a single Anthropic-format `SKILL.md` skill works across Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode unchanged. Optional polish for OpenCode users:
- Add `compatibility: opencode,claude-code,codex` to the frontmatter
- Use lowercase tool names if your skill body invokes tools (`bash`, `edit`, `read` — not `Bash`/`Edit`/`Read`)

Skill access can be gated per-name with the `permission.skill` block in `opencode.json`:

```json
{ "permission": { "skill": { "*": "allow", "internal-*": "deny" } } }
```

See [references/opencode-skills.md](references/opencode-skills.md) for the full OpenCode skills reference.
