## How to Find YOUR 80/20

### Step 1: List Everything

Write down ALL activities in the area you're analyzing:
- What do you spend time on?
- What generates results?
- What costs money/energy?

### Step 2: Measure Impact

For each activity, estimate:
- **Input:** Time, money, or energy spent (% of total)
- **Output:** Results generated (% of total)
- **Ratio:** Output ÷ Input

Example:
| Activity | Input (%) | Output (%) | Ratio |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Cold email | 30% | 5% | 0.17 |
| Referrals | 10% | 45% | 4.5 |
| Content | 25% | 30% | 1.2 |
| Paid ads | 35% | 20% | 0.57 |

### Step 3: Rank and Cut

1. **Double down:** Top 20% by ratio (Referrals in example)
2. **Optimize:** Middle 40% (Content, Paid ads)
3. **Eliminate:** Bottom 40% (Cold email)

### Step 4: Validate with Data

Don't trust gut alone:
- Pull actual revenue by customer
- Track actual time by activity
- Measure actual results by channel

| [Activity 1] | X% | Y% | Y/X | DOUBLE DOWN |
| [Activity 2] | X% | Y% | Y/X | OPTIMIZE |
| [Activity 3] | X% | Y% | Y/X | ELIMINATE |

## Vital 20%

### 1. [Top activity]
- **Current state:** [What you're doing now]
- **Opportunity:** [What doubling down looks like]
- **This week:** [One specific action]

### 2. [Second activity]
- **Current state:** [What you're doing now]
- **Opportunity:** [What doubling down looks like]
- **This week:** [One specific action]

## Eliminate

- [Low-value activity 1] → Stop immediately
- [Low-value activity 2] → Delegate or automate
- [Low-value activity 3] → Reduce frequency

## Expected Impact

- **Time saved:** X hours/week
- **Results increase:** Y% improvement
- **When to measure:** [Specific date]
