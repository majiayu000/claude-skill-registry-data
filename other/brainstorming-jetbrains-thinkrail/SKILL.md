# Brainstorming

## Brainstorm before you build

- Run this workflow only when implementation depends on an unresolved product or design choice.
- The aim is a validated design, recorded as a spec-graph `task-spec`, not a speculative
  implementation.
- Do not implement until the design is accepted. Acceptance criteria or an explicit design already
  supplied by the user count as approval; do not ask them to approve the same decision again.

## The workflow

1. **Orient.** Use the spec-graph skill to find relevant recorded boundaries, contracts, invariants,
   and decisions; read code second to confirm implementation details. Do not read unrelated specs.
2. **Scope check.** If the request bundles independent product decisions or subsystems, separate them
   rather than blending unrelated decisions into one task-spec.
3. **Open a task-spec.** Once the decision to make is understood, `spec_create` a `task-spec` at
   **`.thinkrail/context/TASK-<slug>.md`** (id, title, status: draft, parent: the nearest relevant
   module). This gitignored file is the one temporary design artifact; update it as decisions land.
4. **Interview the open decisions.** Ask via `ask_user_question` about every decision whose answer
   changes observable behavior or scope and that the request or specs have not already settled; look
   facts up instead of asking them. Interview in rounds per the **asking-user-questions** concept skill
   until no such decision is left assumed. Skipped questions or a host with no UI are not blockers:
   record the best assumption as unconfirmed and continue.
5. **Draft the design.** Record the request, recommended design, trade-offs that matter, and explicit
   deferrals. Compare alternatives only when more than one viable approach remains; do not invent
   options after the constraints already select one.
6. **Self-review.** Remove placeholders, contradictions, accidental scope expansion, and ambiguous
   requirements before presenting the design.
7. **Review once.** Present one cohesive design scaled to the decision. Ask for one approval only when
   the user has not already approved the same design through their request or acceptance criteria.
   Revise the task-spec if they adjust it.
8. **Promote.** Read the **writing-specs** concept skill, then move any settled boundary, contract, or
   decision into the relevant durable `SPEC.md`; use `spec_create` for a new module, `spec_update` for
   frontmatter, and `edit` for prose. Run `spec_validate` after structural changes.
9. **Build.** Implement directly against the accepted design. Before handoff, self-review the task
   diff: no silent lint/type suppressions, duplicated nontrivial derivations, rationale left as code
   comments, or remnants of a replaced pattern. Keep durable specs honest and retire the task-spec
   once the work itself is done.

## What a good task-spec looks like

- Scoped to one decision-bearing piece of work.
- States the request, chosen design and why, real alternatives considered, assumptions, and explicit
  deferrals.
- Promotes settled decisions instead of copying them: durable rationale lives once in the owning
  spec.

## Ending

Once the accepted design is implemented, verified, reflected in durable specs, and its task-spec is
retired, this workflow ends with no successor. PR lifecycle work, if requested, then enters
**shipping-a-pr** separately.
