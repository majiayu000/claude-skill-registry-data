# A database for a cloud install

A cloud install keeps everything in a Postgres it reaches by address, read
from the fork's `WEFT_DATABASE_URL` secret. Any Postgres works; if its
address goes through a pooler, the install also needs a direct address of the
same database in `WEFT_DATABASE_LISTEN_URL`.
When the user has none, offer Neon: a hosted Postgres that sleeps while
nothing uses it, with a free plan. Before they sign up, tell them what the
free plan's limits mean for weft (What it costs, below). If they would rather use one they already
pay for, take its address instead and skip the rest of this.

## What the user does

Two things, in their browser:

1. Sign up at `https://console.neon.tech/signup`. They need no project
   there: you make it.
2. Make an API key for their organization: in the Neon console, the
   organization's **Settings**, **API keys**, **Create new API key**, and
   paste it to you once. A key made there names the organization by itself,
   which creating a project needs.

The key is a secret. Put it straight into `NEON_API_KEY` in the same command
that uses it, never into a file, and never repeat it in the chat. Say both
steps plainly, and wait until they are done.

## What you do

Make the project through Neon's API. Pick the Neon region closest to the
install's GCP region, by its id (Neon lists them at
`https://neon.com/docs/introduction/regions`). Run all of this as one Bash call:
each call starts a fresh shell, so the key and the file name would not
survive into a second one. The `trap` deletes the file holding Neon's answer,
which contains the database's password, when that shell ends:

```bash
NEON_API_KEY='<the key>'
neon_json=$(mktemp)
trap 'rm -f "$neon_json"' EXIT
curl -sS https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project": {"name": "weft", "region_id": "<a region id>"}}' > "$neon_json"
jq -e '.connection_uris[0]' "$neon_json" >/dev/null || { cat "$neon_json"; exit 1; }
direct=$(jq -r '.connection_uris[0].connection_uri' "$neon_json")
pooler_host=$(jq -r '.connection_uris[0].connection_parameters.pooler_host' "$neon_json")
printf '%s' "$direct" | sed "s/@[^/:]*/@$pooler_host/" | gh secret set WEFT_DATABASE_URL --repo <fork> &&
  printf '%s' "$direct" | gh secret set WEFT_DATABASE_LISTEN_URL --repo <fork>
```

If it printed Neon's answer and stopped, that is Neon refusing, and the answer
says why (a wrong region id, a limit of the plan). `WEFT_DATABASE_URL` gets the
pooled address (the direct one with its host swapped for `pooler_host`), which
weft does its work on. `WEFT_DATABASE_LISTEN_URL` gets the direct one, because
a pooler cannot hold a `LISTEN`. If `gh` printed an error, the project exists
but one or both secrets are missing (when `WEFT_DATABASE_URL` failed, the
second was never tried): do not run the block again, which would make a second
project. Check which are set with `gh secret list --repo <fork>`, have the user
open the project's **Connect** dialog in the Neon console (the pooled address,
or the direct one with pooling off), and set each missing one with
`gh secret set <NAME> --repo <fork>`, piping in its address. If neither printed anything, both secrets are set: tell the user the
database is ready and go back to weft-cloud-install.

## What it costs

Neon's free plan sleeps the database after five minutes with nothing
connected, and gives a project 100 CU-hours a month (about 400 hours at the smallest size). An idle install
lets it sleep, apart from a check every few hours: once weft's Cloud Run
services have scaled to zero they hold no connection to it. Two things keep it
awake around the clock: a trigger that keeps a connection open, because its
holder checks in through weft every 10 seconds, and a program's
infrastructure while it is up, because the supervisor checks its health every
30. Either one uses up the free hours within the month. When they run out, the
database stops until the next month or a paid plan, and the install stops
with it.
