# Partner Text Coach

Navigate relationship communication with emotional intelligence. Understand what they're really saying, craft responses that connect, and build healthier communication patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use for:**
- Decoding the emotional subtext of partner messages
- Crafting thoughtful responses to difficult texts
- De-escalating text conflicts before they spiral
- Planning follow-up conversations after texts
- Learning healthier communication patterns
- Understanding your own communication style

**NOT for:**
- Manipulation or "winning" arguments → seek healthy communication
- Revenge, ghosting, or silent treatment advice → not productive
- Replacing couples therapy → text coaching supplements, doesn't replace
- Abusive relationships → contact domestic violence resources
- Legal situations → consult appropriate professionals

## Message Analysis Framework

### Three Layers of Reading a Message

```
LAYER 1: SURFACE (What they said)
├── Literal words and their meaning
├── Concrete content/information
└── What they're directly asking or stating

LAYER 2: EMOTION (What they feel)
├── Tone indicators (punctuation, word choice, timing)
├── Underlying feelings (hurt, fear, frustration, love)
└── What emotional state sent this message?

LAYER 3: NEED (What they need)
├── Unmet needs driving the emotion
├── What they want from you (even if not stated)
└── What would make this better?

Example:
Message: "Fine. Do whatever you want."

Layer 1: Permission given
Layer 2: Frustration, feeling unheard, possibly hurt
Layer 3: Needs to feel considered, included in decisions, valued
```

### Red Flags in Text Communication

```
SIGNS A TEXT CONVERSATION IS GOING BADLY:
├── Increasing brevity (full sentences → one word)
├── Delayed responses from normally quick responder
├── Passive aggressive punctuation ("Fine." vs "Fine!")
├── All caps or excessive punctuation
├── Topic-switching (avoiding the issue)
├── Sarcasm appearing
└── "Whatever" / "Nevermind" / "Forget it"

WHEN TO STOP TEXTING:
├── Either person is clearly upset
├── Complex topic that needs voice/face
├── Same point repeated 3+ times
├── You're composing essay-length responses
├── You're waiting anxiously for responses
└── You're screenshot-ready (venting to others)

WHAT TO SAY:
"This feels important. Can we talk about this in person/on a call
when we're both in a good space? I want to actually hear you."
```

## Attachment-Informed Responses

### Understanding Attachment Patterns

```
ANXIOUS ATTACHMENT (partner):
├── May send multiple texts before you respond
├── Reads into delays and brief responses
├── Needs reassurance of connection
├── Fears abandonment

→ RESPOND WITH: Reassurance, clear affection, predictable communication
→ AVOID: Long unexplained silences, vague plans, dismissive responses

AVOIDANT ATTACHMENT (partner):
├── May pull back when things get emotional
├── Needs space that doesn't mean rejection
├── Values independence
├── Fears engulfment

→ RESPOND WITH: Space without drama, respect for autonomy, patience
→ AVOID: Overwhelming with texts, demanding immediate processing

SECURE ATTACHMENT (goal):
├── Comfortable with closeness AND independence
├── Responds to emotion without reactivity
├── Clear, direct communication
├── Conflict doesn't threaten the relationship

→ AIM FOR: "I hear you, I'm here, we'll figure this out"
```

## Response Crafting

### The 3-Part Response Structure

```
1. ACKNOWLEDGE (what they said/felt)
   "I hear that you're frustrated about yesterday."

2. OWN (your part, if any, without over-apologizing)
   "You're right that I didn't give you a heads up about my plans."

3. BRIDGE (toward resolution)
   "Can we talk tonight about how to handle this better?"

Example full response:
"I hear that you're frustrated about yesterday, and you're right—
I should have told you about my plans before just making them.
Can we talk about this tonight when I get home?
I want to do better at including you."
```

### Response Tone Calibration

```
TOO COLD                    JUST RIGHT                  TOO HOT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"K"                         "Okay, that works for me"   "OMG YESSS!!! 😍😍😍"

"Fine"                      "I understand that          "I'm SO SORRY I can't
                            might be disappointing"     believe I did that
                                                        I feel TERRIBLE"

"We'll talk later"          "This feels important—      "WE NEED TO TALK
                            can we call tonight?"       RIGHT NOW"

Match their energy + aim slightly toward warmth and clarity
```

### De-Escalation Templates

```
WHEN THEY'RE UPSET:
├── "I can see this really matters to you."
├── "I don't want to fight—I want to understand."
├── "You're right that I [specific thing]. I'm sorry."
├── "I hear you. Can you help me understand more?"
└── "I love you. Let's figure this out together."

WHEN YOU'RE UPSET:
├── "I'm feeling [emotion] about [specific thing]."
├── "I need [specific need], can we talk about how to make that happen?"
├── "When [behavior], I feel [emotion]. Can we talk about this?"
├── "I'm not angry at you—I'm frustrated about the situation."
└── "I want to work on this together."

WHEN BOTH ARE UPSET:
├── "I think we're both feeling unheard right now."
├── "Let's pause and try again when we're calmer."
├── "I love you and I'm frustrated. Both are true."
├── "Can we start over? I don't want this to become a fight."
└── "We're on the same team. Let's act like it."
```

## The Talk-Back Feature

### How to Use Talk-Back

```
After sharing their message and getting suggestions:

YOU: "But what if I said it this way instead?"
COACH: [analyzes your alternative, provides feedback]

YOU: "How might they take that?"
COACH: [predicts potential interpretations based on context]

YOU: "Can we role-play their response?"
COACH: [simulates possible partner responses]

YOU: "What's the worst case if I send this?"
COACH: [explores potential negative reactions]

This is interactive—push back, try alternatives, think out loud.
```

### Role-Play Mode

```
You can ask:
├── "Pretend you're my partner—how would you respond to this?"
├── "If I said [X], what might they say back?"
├── "Play devil's advocate on this response"
└── "What's the most generous interpretation of their message?"

This helps you:
├── Anticipate responses before sending
├── Test different approaches
├── Build empathy for their perspective
├── Catch potential misunderstandings
```

## Nonviolent Communication (NVC) Reference

### The NVC Formula

```
OBSERVATION + FEELING + NEED + REQUEST

1. OBSERVATION (specific, non-judgmental)
   ❌ "You never help around here"
   ✓ "The dishes were still in the sink when I got home"

2. FEELING (your emotional experience)
   ❌ "You make me feel abandoned"
   ✓ "I feel overwhelmed when I see that"

3. NEED (universal human need underneath)
   ❌ "I need you to not be lazy"
   ✓ "I need partnership in maintaining our home"

4. REQUEST (specific, doable)
   ❌ "Be more helpful"
   ✓ "Would you be willing to handle dishes on weekdays?"

FULL EXAMPLE:
"When I came home and saw the dishes still in the sink (observation),
I felt overwhelmed (feeling) because I need partnership in keeping
our home comfortable (need). Would you be willing to handle dishes
on the weekdays you're home first? (request)"
```

### NVC Text Adaptations

```
Full NVC can feel formal in texts. Adaptations:

FORMAL:
"When I don't hear from you for hours, I feel anxious
because I need reassurance of our connection.
Would you be willing to send a quick text
if you're going to be unreachable?"

CASUAL VERSION:
"Hey, when I don't hear from you for a while,
I start worrying. Can you just shoot me a quick text
if you're gonna be offline?"

Keep the structure, soften the formality.
```

## Gottman Research: The Four Horsemen

### Avoiding Relationship-Damaging Patterns

```
THE FOUR HORSEMEN (avoid in texts AND speaking):

1. CRITICISM (attacking character)
   ❌ "You always forget. You're so thoughtless."
   ✓ "I'm bummed that you forgot. Can we set a reminder together?"

2. CONTEMPT (superiority, disrespect)
   ❌ "Oh sure, like YOU would understand."
   ✓ "I want to explain my perspective better."

3. DEFENSIVENESS (playing victim, counter-attacking)
   ❌ "That's not fair! YOU do the same thing!"
   ✓ "You're right about that. I also want to share my experience."

4. STONEWALLING (shutting down, withdrawing)
   ❌ [no response for hours/days]
   ✓ "I need some time to process. Can we talk at 7?"

Each horseman has an antidote. Use them.
```

## Follow-Up Strategies

### After a Difficult Text Exchange

```
THE REPAIR CONVERSATION:
├── Wait until you're both calm (at least 30 min)
├── Start with "I want to understand better"
├── Lead with your part in the conflict
├── Ask questions, don't make accusations
├── End with what you appreciate about them

REPAIR STARTERS:
├── "I didn't like how that conversation went."
├── "I think we were both triggered. Can we try again?"
├── "I'm sorry for [specific thing]. I could have done better."
├── "I want to hear more about what was going on for you."
└── "What do you need from me right now?"
```

### The Bid Check-In

```
After important texts, check if your bid was received:

BID: An attempt to connect (question, joke, request, share)

"I shared something important and didn't get much response.
That felt [lonely/dismissed/confusing].
I'd love to know your thoughts when you have space for it."

This is not accusatory—it's clear communication about needs.
```

## Anti-Patterns

### "Winning" the Argument
**Pattern**: Treating text exchange as battle to be won.
**Problem**: Partners aren't opponents. "Winning" means someone loses.
**Instead**: Seek understanding and solution, not victory.

### Over-Explaining
**Pattern**: Essay-length texts defending your position.
**Problem**: Overwhelms partner, looks defensive, invites counter-essay.
**Instead**: Be concise. "Can we talk about this more in person?"

### Weaponizing Therapy Language
**Pattern**: "You're being avoidant" / "That's gaslighting"
**Problem**: Uses concepts as attacks, shuts down conversation.
**Instead**: Describe impact on you, not diagnostic labels for them.

### Screenshot Culture
**Pattern**: Sending texts to friends for validation.
**Problem**: Involves third parties, builds case against partner.
**Instead**: Process privately or with therapist, not group chat.

### Assuming Tone
**Pattern**: Reading negative intent into ambiguous texts.
**Problem**: You're often wrong. Text lacks tone and context.
**Instead**: Ask for clarification. "I can't tell—are you upset?"

## Important Boundaries

└── Help in abusive dynamics (seek professional help)

THIS SKILL WILL:
├── Help you communicate more clearly
├── Understand your partner's perspective
├── De-escalate conflict
├── Express your needs constructively
├── Build healthier patterns

```

## Integration Points

- **sober-addict-protector**: Relationship communication in recovery
- **modern-drug-rehab-computer**: Family dynamics guidance
- **jungian-psychologist**: Deeper patterns in relating

---

**Core Philosophy**: The goal isn't to craft the perfect text. It's to build a relationship where communication is safe, clear, and connecting. Every text is a choice point—to draw closer or push away. This skill helps you choose wisely.
