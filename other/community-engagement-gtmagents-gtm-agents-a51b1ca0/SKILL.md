# Community Engagement Patterns Skill

## When to Use
- Launching or refreshing Slack/Discord/Facebook/LinkedIn communities.
- Designing ambassador, influencer, or creator enablement programs.
- Handling sentiment spikes (positive or negative) tied to social content.

## Framework

### Engagement Building Blocks
1. **Rituals** – recurring AMAs, demo days, office hours, wins threads.
2. **Spotlights** – member highlights, case study showcases, creator takeovers.
3. **Challenges** – thematic prompts with templates, prizes, referral boosts.
4. **Feedback Loops** – polls, surveys, beta access, roadmap Q&As.

### Program Playbook
- Define success metrics (active members, participation %, referral pipeline).
- Assign moderation tiers and escalation paths.
- Create template library (welcome flows, DM scripts, escalation responses).
- Sync weekly with product/support to triage insights.

### Response Framework
- **Listen** – capture sentiment, metadata, severity.
- **Acknowledge** – respond publicly if appropriate, move to DMs when sensitive.
- **Resolve** – collaborate with support/product/legal.
- **Document** – log issue + resolution to inform future programming.

## Templates
- Community health dashboard template.
- Ambassador enablement kit.
- Crisis response matrix (severity ladder + owner by stage).
- Welcome/onboarding message pack with DM + channel scripts.

## Tips
- Publish a weekly wins digest to reinforce positive behavior and keep leadership informed.
- Maintain an escalation log so repeat issues inform new rituals or automations.
- Rotate moderators quarterly to prevent burnout and keep tone aligned with evolving brand voice.
- Pair community programming with GTM launches (betas, AMAs) to reinforce ROI.
