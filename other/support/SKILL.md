# Support Guideline

## Tech Stack

* **Framework**: Next.js (with Turbopack)
* **Email**: Resend

## Non-Negotiables

* Self-service must be prioritized over contact forms
* Support context must include user state (plan, usage, recent actions)
* Response time expectations must be set and met

## Context

Support is where trust is won or lost. Users who need help are often frustrated — the support experience either deepens their trust or confirms their fears.

Great support isn't just fast responses — it's making users not need support in the first place. Every support ticket is a signal that something in the product could be clearer.

## Driving Questions

* What are the most common support requests and can they be self-served?
* What context does support need that they don't have?
* Where does the product create confusion that leads to support tickets?
* How would we handle a surge in support volume?
* What would make users feel supported before they ask for help?
