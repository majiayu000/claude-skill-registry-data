# Large-Scale Hook Composition (React 18)

## Summary

Engineer hook ecosystems with composable, scalable abstractions that preserve correctness under concurrency.

## Key Capabilities

- Create layered hooks with strict dependency contracts.
- Prevent hook-induced render cascades.
- Ensure stable hook identities under refactoring.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Prove compositional correctness of hook stacks.
- Model dependency blow-up and mitigate it.
- Analyze reusability vs coupling trade-offs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Provide a hook composition map and contracts.
- Demonstrate stability under refactors.
- Document performance impacts of hook layers.
