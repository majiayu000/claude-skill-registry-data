  This skill should be used when the user asks to "plan my LinkedIn content",
  "create a content calendar", "what should I post about this week", "plan my
  posting schedule", or when Genesis proactively suggests a weekly content plan
  during surplus compute. Also triggered by "I need post ideas" or "I don't
  know what to write about".

# LinkedIn Content Calendar

## Purpose

Plan a cadence of LinkedIn posts that maintains consistent presence without
burning the user out. Produce concrete post ideas with angles — not vague
topics. Balance content types to avoid monotony. Adapt to the user's actual
capacity for posting.

## Voice Loading

Even though this skill plans rather than drafts, the generated post ideas
(angles, hook suggestions) should be grounded in the user's voice and topic
domains. Load voice context via voice-master's overlay resolution:

1. Read `../voice-master/SKILL.md` and follow its **User Calibration
   Overlay** section to load the user's voice-dimensions and exemplars
   from the out-of-repo overlay (or the template fallback with warning
   if no overlay exists).
2. This skill's medium is `social`. Use the user's topic domains and
   voice-dimensions to inform angle selection, not to draft post prose.
3. Read `../voice-master/references/anti-slop.md` — apply the
   **Universal** and **Professional / LinkedIn** sections when sanity-
   checking hook suggestions.

If no overlay is present, voice-master falls back to the template and
warns — the calendar can still be generated but the angles will be
generic. Surface this clearly in your output.

## Calendar Design Principles

**Consistency over volume.** 2 posts/week every week beats 5 posts one week
and silence for three. Start conservative, increase only if sustainable.

**Variety in type.** Rotate through post types (experience, insight, technical,
commentary, question) to avoid becoming predictable. No more than 2 of the
same type in a row.

**Timeliness.** Connect at least one post per cycle to something currently
happening in the user's industry. Evergreen content is fine but a mix with
timely content performs better.

**Effort-awareness.** Some posts require deep thought (experience, insight).
Some are lighter (commentary, question). Alternate high-effort and low-effort
to prevent burnout. Flag effort level on each idea.

## Planning Process

1. **Establish cadence** — Ask the user how often they want to post. Default
   recommendation: 2-3x per week. Minimum viable: 1x per week. Adjust based
   on what the user can actually sustain.

2. **Inventory topics** — Pull from:
   - User's expertise areas (from voice profile)
   - Recent projects or work activity
   - Industry news and trends
   - Previous posts that performed well
   - Topics the user has expressed opinions on
   - Knowledge gaps where writing would force useful thinking
   - Items from the user's inbox or reading list

3. **Generate ideas with angles** — Each idea is a specific angle, not a topic.
   Bad: "Write about Kubernetes." Good: "The hidden cost of K8s that nobody
   talks about — your team's cognitive load." Include the post type and
   estimated effort level.

4. **Schedule** — Assign ideas to specific days/weeks. Consider:
   - Best posting times for the user's audience (typically Tue-Thu mornings)
   - Spacing between similar topics
   - High-effort posts early in the week (more energy)
   - Light posts (commentary, questions) for low-energy days

5. **Buffer** — Always plan 1-2 extra ideas beyond the calendar period. Ideas
   that aren't used roll to the next cycle, not lost.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Content Calendar: [Date Range]

**Cadence:** [N] posts/week
**Post types this cycle:** [breakdown]

## Week of [Date]

### [Day] — [Post Type]
**Angle:** [Specific angle, not just a topic]
**Hook idea:** [One strong opening line option]
**Effort:** Low | Medium | High
**Timely?:** Yes (reason) | No (evergreen)
**Notes:** [Any context — what prompted this idea, related reading]

### [Day] — [Post Type]
...

## Buffer Ideas (Unused — Roll Forward)
- [Angle 1] ([type], [effort])
- [Angle 2] ([type], [effort])
```

## Proactive Calendar Generation

When Genesis generates a content calendar during surplus compute:
- Review what the user has been working on this week (from conversation
  history, inbox items, cognitive state)
- Check what's happening in the user's industry
- Draft a 1-week plan with 2-3 post ideas
- Stage as surplus output for user review
- Include reasoning for why each topic was selected now
