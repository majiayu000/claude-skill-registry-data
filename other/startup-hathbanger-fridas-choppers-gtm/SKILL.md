# Startup Skill

The startup journey from idea to scale, informed by Paul Graham + Garry Tan wisdom.

---

## Philosophy

**Vision is emergent.** You don't know what you're building at first. The skill adapts to where you are.

**Do things that don't scale.** Early stage is about learning, not efficiency.

**Talk to users.** Every week. The answers are in conversations, not spreadsheets.

## THE STAGES

### Stage 0: Idea

**Goal:** Validate that real people have this problem and will pay to solve it.

**Key questions:**
- Who has this problem? (Be specific—names, not personas)
- How are they solving it now?
- Why will they switch to you?
- What's the insight that makes this work?

**PG frameworks:**
- "How to Get Startup Ideas" - Live in the future, build what's missing
- "Schlep Blindness" - The best ideas look like work
- "Organic Startup Ideas" - Build what you need yourself
- "Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas" - Think bigger

**Actions:**
1. Talk to 10 potential users this week
2. Document their exact words (not your interpretation)
3. Find the hair-on-fire problem

**Anti-patterns:**
- Building before talking
- Asking "would you use this?" (ask about their current behavior)
- Targeting everyone (niche down)

---

### Stage 1: MVP

**Goal:** Build the smallest thing that delivers value to one person.

**Key questions:**
- What's the one thing it needs to do?
- Can you build it in 2 weeks?
- Can you describe it in one sentence?

**PG frameworks:**
- "Do Things That Don't Scale" - Manual before automated
- "The Airbnbs" - Professional photos changed everything
- "Ramen Profitable" - Survive while you figure it out
- "Default Alive or Default Dead" - Know which you are

**Actions:**
1. Cut scope until it hurts
2. Ship something this week
3. Get it in front of one real user

**Anti-patterns:**
- Building for 6 months before launching
- Adding features before anyone uses it
- Waiting until it's "ready"

---

### Stage 2: First Customers

**Goal:** Get 5-10 paying customers manually.

**Key questions:**
- Who are the first 10 people who will pay?
- Can you name them?
- How will you reach them?

**PG frameworks:**
- "Do Things That Don't Scale" - Recruit users manually
- "Relentlessly Resourceful" - Find a way or make one
- "Be Good" - Make something people want
- "Mean People Fail" - Nice founders win

**Garry frameworks:**
- "Default alive matters" - Grow profitably if you can't raise
- "Six skills for startup success" - What to develop early

**Actions:**
1. Make a list of 20 potential customers (names, not categories)
2. Reach out to 5 today
3. Offer to do it for them manually

**Anti-patterns:**
- Waiting for inbound
- Mass marketing before product-market fit
- Discounting instead of learning

---

### Stage 3: Launch

**Goal:** Create a moment that gets attention and establishes your position.

**Key questions:**
- What's the story?
- Who will amplify it?
- What's the one thing people should remember?

**PG frameworks:**
- "Startup = Growth" - Launch is just the beginning of the curve
- "How to Convince Investors" - Same principles apply to users
- "The Submarine" - PR is a game

**Actions:**
1. Line up 5 people who will share on launch day
2. Have a specific, concrete demo
3. Ship, don't wait for perfect

**Anti-patterns:**
- Launch as a one-time event (it's a process)
- Waiting for the "right moment"
- Announcing without showing

---

### Stage 4: Growth

**Goal:** Find repeatable acquisition and scale what works.

**Key questions:**
- What's your growth rate?
- What's the one channel that's working?
- Are you default alive?

**PG frameworks:**
- "Startup = Growth" - If you're not growing, you're dying
- "The Fatal Pinch" - When growth and runway cross
- "How to Raise Money" - Raise when you don't need it
- "Founder Mode" - Stay hands-on longer than feels right

**Garry frameworks:**
- "Why startups are growing 5x faster" - AI enables smaller teams
- "Micromanagement is toxic" - Delegate as you scale

**Actions:**
1. Measure weekly growth rate
2. Double down on what's working
3. Kill what isn't

**Anti-patterns:**
- Premature scaling
- Hiring before product-market fit
- Multiple channels before one works

## DIAGNOSIS FRAMEWORK

When something's wrong, find the root cause:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Prescription |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| No users signing up | Distribution problem or wrong audience | Talk to 10 more people, find where they are |
| Users sign up but don't use | Onboarding or value prop problem | Watch 5 users try it, fix the friction |
| Users use but don't pay | Pricing or value problem | Ask them what they'd pay for |
| Users churn | Not solving real problem | Talk to churned users, find why |
| Can't raise money | Traction or story problem | Focus on customers, not investors |
| Growing but unprofitable | Unit economics problem | Fix before you scale |

---

## INTEGRATION WITH DOCS

The skill reads your docs to understand where you are:

```
knowledge/VISION.md     → EMERGENT = still figuring it out
                       → DECLARED = you know what you're building

knowledge/CRM.md        → Who you're talking to, what's resonating

content/articles/       → How you explain it to the world

drafts/                 → Active outreach, what's working
```
