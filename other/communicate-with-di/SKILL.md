## Who is the Di?

Di types are assertive, bold, and resistant to influence from others. They combine the drive and decisiveness of the D style with the people-oriented energy of the I style, making them natural leaders who can both take charge and inspire others. They are skilled negotiators who pursue large goals with speed and intensity, and they are vocal about their opinions and ideas. Their confidence is infectious, and they thrive when they can set the pace for others.

## Do's

- Be direct, confident, and assertive in your communication. They respect people who hold their own.
- Lead with your key point or request -- they retain the most important information and skim the rest.
- Match their pace and energy. Quick responses and decisive action earn their respect.
- Allow them to take charge of projects and decisions when appropriate.
- Keep conversations spontaneous and to the point rather than rigidly structured.
- Present ideas you can defend with logic. They enjoy healthy debate.
- Give them freedom to work independently and pursue new opportunities.
- Focus on results and action, not process and procedure.

## Don'ts

- Don't be overly cautious, hesitant, or wishy-washy. They'll disengage quickly.
- Don't overwhelm them with detailed analyses, lengthy reports, or extensive background.
- Don't require them to follow rigid schedules and routines.
- Don't expect them to build consensus on every decision -- they prefer to decide and move.
- Don't take their directness personally. Their bluntness is efficiency, not hostility.
- Don't force them into purely supporting roles where they can't influence outcomes.
- Don't require lengthy emotional processing before getting to solutions.
- Don't ignore their ideas or dismiss them without a well-reasoned counter-argument.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Keep meetings spontaneous, to the point, and brief. Di types dislike overly structured meetings that drag on. Focus on decisions and action items rather than extensive discussion. If possible, handle simple matters through quick conversations instead of formal meetings.

### Email
Keep emails short, to the point, and containing minimal detail. Lead with your request or key information. Use bullet points for multiple items and be clear about what action you need. Skip the pleasantries and get straight to business.

### Giving Feedback
Deliver feedback directly, focusing on actionable points. Di types appreciate honesty and can handle straightforward criticism. Focus on the most important points rather than comprehensive lists, and frame feedback in terms of impact and results rather than feelings.

### Resolving Conflict
Address conflicts openly with a problem-solving mindset. Di types prefer to tackle issues head-on rather than letting them fester. Focus on solutions and outcomes rather than dwelling on the problem or assigning blame.
