## YouTube Algorithm Deep Dive

### Primary Algorithm Signals

| Click-through rate (CTR) | Very High | Clicks / Impressions |
| Session time | High | Time viewer spends on YouTube after |
| Engagement | Medium | Likes, comments, shares, saves |

### How the Algorithm Works

### Algorithm Optimization Strategies

**Maximize Watch Time:**
- Front-load value (but tease more)
- Eliminate dead time and filler

- Add chapters for navigation

**Optimize CTR:**
- A/B test thumbnails (Test & Compare feature)
- Use emotional faces (20-30% CTR boost)

## The 5-10 Second Hook (Long-Form)

### Long-Form Hook Differences

Unlike short-form's 1.3-second rule, long-form allows 5-10 seconds for hooks, but the principles remain:

**Hook Components:**
1. **Pattern Interrupt** (0-2 seconds): Stop the scroll
2. **Promise** (2-5 seconds): What viewer will get
3. **Proof/Preview** (5-10 seconds): Why to trust you

### Long-Form Hook Templates

**Preview Hook:**
"In this video, I'm going to show you [result]. By the end, you'll know [specific outcome]."

**Curiosity Hook:**
"What I'm about to share changed everything I thought I knew about [topic]..."

**Result Hook:**
[Show the end result] "This is what we're building today, and I'll show you exactly how."

**Story Hook:**
"Three months ago, I made a mistake that cost me [consequence]. Here's what I learned..."

**Problem Hook:**
"If you've ever struggled with [problem], you're not alone. Here's what actually works."

### Hook Mistakes to Avoid

- "Hey guys, welcome back to my channel..."
- Long intro animations
- Asking for likes/subscribes before value
- Generic greetings
- Explaining what you won't cover
