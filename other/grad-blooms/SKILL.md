# Bloom's Revised Taxonomy

## Overview

Bloom's revised taxonomy (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001) classifies cognitive processes into six hierarchical levels: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. Combined with the knowledge dimension (factual, conceptual, procedural, metacognitive), it provides a two-dimensional framework for designing and assessing learning.

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- Writing learning objectives at specific cognitive levels
- Aligning assessment methods with intended learning outcomes
- Auditing curriculum for cognitive complexity balance

**When NOT to use:**
- When designing scaffolded learning experiences (use constructivism / ZPD)
- When managing cognitive load in instructional design (use cognitive load theory)
- When integrating technology into teaching (use TPACK framework)

## Assumptions

```
IRON LAW: Higher-Order Thinking REQUIRES a Foundation of Lower-Order Knowledge

You cannot analyze what you don't understand. You cannot evaluate
what you haven't analyzed. You cannot create without evaluation criteria.
The hierarchy is:
  Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze → Evaluate → Create
Skipping levels produces superficial "higher-order" work built on
a weak knowledge foundation.
```

## Methodology

### Step 1: Identify Knowledge Type
Classify the target knowledge: factual (terminology, details), conceptual (categories, principles), procedural (how-to, techniques), or metacognitive (self-awareness, strategies).

### Step 2: Select Cognitive Level
Choose the appropriate cognitive process level. Use action verbs that are observable and measurable for each level.

### Step 3: Write Objectives
Combine: "Students will be able to [action verb] [knowledge content] [context/condition]." Ensure the verb matches the intended cognitive level.

### Step 4: Align Assessment
Match assessment methods to the cognitive level. Remember/Understand → objective tests. Apply/Analyze → case studies, problem sets. Evaluate/Create → projects, portfolios, essays.

## Output Format

# Learning Objectives Analysis: {Course/Module}

## Taxonomy Mapping
| Objective | Cognitive Level | Knowledge Type | Action Verb | Assessment Method |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| ... | Remember/Understand/Apply/Analyze/Evaluate/Create | Factual/Conceptual/Procedural/Metacognitive | ... | ... |

## Cognitive Level Distribution
- Lower-order (Remember, Understand, Apply): {count, %}
- Higher-order (Analyze, Evaluate, Create): {count, %}
- Balance assessment: {adequate or needs adjustment}

## Alignment Check
- Objectives ↔ Instruction: {aligned / gaps}
- Objectives ↔ Assessment: {aligned / gaps}

## Recommendations
{Specific suggestions for improving cognitive level balance and alignment}

## Gotchas

- **Verbs are ambiguous**: "Understand" is not directly observable. Use specific verbs: "explain," "classify," "summarize." Multiple taxonomies map verbs to levels — they don't always agree.
- **Hierarchy is not rigid**: The revised taxonomy acknowledges that the order between Evaluate and Create can vary. Some creative tasks don't require prior evaluation, and some evaluation doesn't require creation.
- **Higher ≠ better**: Not all objectives should be at the Create level. Foundational courses legitimately emphasize Remember and Understand. The goal is APPROPRIATE level, not maximum level.
- **Culture of verb-matching**: Swapping in a "higher" verb without changing the actual cognitive demand is cosmetic. "Analyze the definition" is still Remember if students just recite a memorized analysis.
- **Affective and psychomotor domains**: Bloom's cognitive taxonomy is one of THREE domains. It doesn't address attitudes/values (affective) or physical skills (psychomotor).
