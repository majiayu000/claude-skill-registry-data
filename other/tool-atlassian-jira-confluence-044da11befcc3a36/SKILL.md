# Atlassian Jira & Confluence Skill

## Startup Checklist

1. **Load config** — Read `references/config.json` for `cloudId`, `jiraProjectKey`, `confluenceSpaceId`. Never call `getAccessibleAtlassianResources`.
2. **First-time setup?** — If config values are missing/placeholder, read `references/setup.md` and guide the user through setup before proceeding.
3. **Identify the task** — Match the request to a Feature below and load its reference.

---

## Confirmation Protocol

**Before any write/create/update/delete MCP call:**
- Show a preview of what will be sent
- Ask: *"Does this look correct? Reply yes to proceed, or tell me what to change."*
- Wait for explicit approval before calling the tool

**Read-only operations** (search, fetch, list transitions) — execute immediately, no confirmation needed.

> For the full preview format per action type, see `references/confirmation-protocol.md`.

| **Jira Operations** | create/search/update tickets, add comments, transition status | `references/jira-operations.md` |
| **Confluence Operations** | create/update/search pages, read wiki content | `references/confluence-operations.md` |

Load only the reference relevant to the current task.
