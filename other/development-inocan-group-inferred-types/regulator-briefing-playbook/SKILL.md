# Regulator Briefing Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing FINRA/SEC/CFPB/FTC briefing packages or responses.
- Documenting campaign decisions in anticipation of audits.
- Coordinating cross-functional responses to regulator inquiries.

## Framework
1. **Briefing Outline** – context, product/campaign details, risk mitigations, approvals.
2. **Evidence Binder** – assets, disclosures, policy references, decision logs, metrics.
3. **Q&A Matrix** – anticipated regulator questions with approved responses + owners.
4. **Escalation Charter** – roles, SLAs, and communications plan for regulator interactions.
5. **Follow-up Tracker** – commitments, remediation steps, and deadlines.

## Templates
- Regulator memo template (executive summary, evidence, appendices).
- Q&A log with question, owner, response, status.
- Commitment tracker linked to Jira/Asana or compliance tools.

## Tips
- Keep version history and timestamps to prove timely responses.
- Align narrative with risk/compliance frameworks used internally.
- Pair with `review-financial-campaign` and `manage-trust-communications` outputs.
