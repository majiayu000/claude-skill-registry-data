description: Approach for planning and implementing code changes. Use when starting new features, starting bug fixes, beginning any implementation work, or when unsure how to approach a coding task. Covers learning the codebase first, verifying approaches, and writing simple maintainable code.

# Planning and Building

## Before You Build

1. **Learn first** - Study the codebase before implementing. Search for similar functionality to understand how problems are typically solved in this project.
2. **Verify approach** - Search for relevant code to confirm your approach matches existing patterns. Don't assume—verify with existing code.
3. **Consider improvements** - Consider if there's a better solution than what was described.

## Correctness
- It is very important that changes are correct.
- Double check requirements as needed.
- Double check language or framework documentation to verify the accuracy of your solution.

## Code Principles

- **Simplicity above all** - Write simple, readable, maintainable code. When in doubt, choose the more obvious approach.
- **Single responsibility** - One purpose per method and class
- **No premature abstractions** - Wait until patterns emerge
- **Clear intent over clever code** - Be boring and obvious
