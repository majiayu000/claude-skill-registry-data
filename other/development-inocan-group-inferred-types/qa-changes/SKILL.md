This skill provides the ability to analyze code changes and suggest relevant QA test cases to ensure software quality. Specially to be used with the `qa-use` toolkit (MCP, other skills, subagents, etc).

## Instructions

You should:

1. Analyze the provided code changes (diffs, pull requests, commits, etc).
2. Identify areas that may require QA testing based on the changes.
3. Check previously generated QA test cases to see if they cover the new changes.
4. Suggest new QA test cases or modifications to existing ones to cover the changes effectively.
