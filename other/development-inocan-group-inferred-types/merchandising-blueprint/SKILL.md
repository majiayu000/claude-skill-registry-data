# Merchandising Blueprint Skill

## When to Use
- Building seasonal or always-on merchandising strategies.
- Coordinating cross-channel launches (onsite, email, paid, affiliates).
- Auditing current site experience for gaps or inconsistencies.

## Framework
1. **Calendar & Objectives** – map themes, KPIs, and inventory constraints.
2. **Offer Architecture** – hero promos, bundles, cross-sell ladders, loyalty tie-ins.
3. **Experience System** – PDP optimizations, navigation, content modules, personalization rules.
4. **Channel Alignment** – asset requirements, copy variations, QA checklists.
5. **Measurement Loop** – KPI dashboards, readout cadence, learning archive.

## Templates
- Promo calendar spreadsheet with dependencies + owner columns.
- Merchandising layout guide (homepage, PLP, PDP modules).
- QA + launch checklist across CMS, analytics, and marketing tools.

## Tips
- Always link offers to inventory + margin guardrails to avoid over-discounting.
- Coordinate creative refreshes with experiment timelines to isolate impact.
- Pair with `plan-merchandising-campaign` for automation and tracking.
