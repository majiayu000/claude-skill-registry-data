# 🚨 CRITICAL: TDD STATE MACHINE GOVERNANCE 🚨

**EVERY SINGLE MESSAGE MUST START WITH YOUR CURRENT TDD STATE**

Format:
```
🔴 TDD: RED
🟢 TDD: GREEN
🔵 TDD: REFACTOR
⚪ TDD: PLANNING
🟡 TDD: VERIFY
⚠️ TDD: BLOCKED
```

**NOT JUST THE FIRST MESSAGE. EVERY. SINGLE. MESSAGE.**

When you read a file → prefix with TDD state
When you run tests → prefix with TDD state
When you explain results → prefix with TDD state
When you ask a question → prefix with TDD state

Example:
```
⚪ TDD: PLANNING
Writing test for negative price validation...

⚪ TDD: PLANNING
Running npm test to see it fail...

⚪ TDD: PLANNING
Test output shows: Expected CannotHaveNegativePrice error but received -50
Test fails correctly. Transitioning to RED.

🔴 TDD: RED
Test IS failing. Implementing minimum code to make it pass...
```

**🚨 FAILURE TO ANNOUNCE TDD STATE = SEVERE VIOLATION 🚨**

    THIS SKILL OPERATES UNDER STRICT STATE MACHINE GOVERNANCE.

    You CANNOT skip states.
    You CANNOT assume phase completion without evidence.
    You CANNOT proceed without satisfying post-conditions.
    You MUST announce state on EVERY message.
    You MUST validate transitions before executing them.

    VIOLATION OF STATE MACHINE = IMMEDIATE STOP + VIOLATION REPORT
  </critical_override>

  <state_consistency_protocol>
    🚨 ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINT #1: MANDATORY STATE CONSISTENCY CHECK 🚨

    BEFORE writing ANY response to user (this runs AUTOMATICALLY like a compiler):

    1. STATE RE-VALIDATION CHECKPOINT
       Ask yourself: "What TDD state am I claiming to be in?"

    2. EVIDENCE CHECK - Verify evidence exists in your recent tool calls:
       - If claiming PLANNING: Am I writing and running a test to see it fail?
       - If claiming RED: Did I see test FAILURE in PLANNING, test IS currently failing, am I implementing code?
       - If claiming GREEN: Did I implement code in RED and see test PASS, code COMPILE, code LINT, all IS currently passing?
       - If claiming REFACTOR: Test IS passing, code compiles, code lints, am I improving code quality?
       - If claiming VERIFY: Test IS passing, am I running full suite/lint/build?

    3. MANDATORY RECOVERY IF MISMATCH
       If you claim state X but lack evidence in your tool call history:

       🔥 STATE VIOLATION DETECTED
       "I claimed [STATE] but I have not satisfied its pre-conditions.
       Evidence missing: [what specific evidence is missing]
       Correct state is: [actual state based on evidence in tool history]
       Recovering to correct state now..."

    4. ONLY AFTER VALIDATION PASSES: Write response

    This check is ARCHITECTURAL, not optional. You cannot bypass it.
    Think of it like a compiler checking types before allowing compilation.
  </state_consistency_protocol>

  <state_announcement_enforcement>
    BEFORE writing ANY message to user:
    1. Check current state
    2. Write state prefix: `🔴 TDD: RED` (or current state)
    3. Then write your message
    4. NEVER skip step 2

    If you realize you forgot state prefix:
    - IMMEDIATELY announce: "⚠️ STATE VIOLATION DETECTED - Missing state announcement"
    - Announce correct current state
    - Continue

        7. Run quick compilation check (e.g., tsc --noEmit, or project-specific compile command)
        8. Run lint on changed code
        9. If compile/lint fails: Fix issues and return to step 4 (re-run test)

        12. ONLY AFTER completing steps 4-11: Announce post-condition validation
        13. ONLY AFTER validation passes: Transition to GREEN

      <post_conditions>
        ✓ Minimum code implemented

      </post_conditions>

      <pre_flight_check>
        🚨 BEFORE announcing validation, execute these commands:
        1. Run test command → Must see PASS output
        2. Run compile command → Must see "Successfully" or equivalent
        3. Run lint command → Must see success/no errors

        NO "presumably". NO "should work". NO "looks like".
        If you haven't executed it, you haven't validated it.
        Only proceed to validation after all three commands show success.
      </pre_flight_check>

      <validation_before_transition>
        🚨 ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINT #4: POST-CONDITION EVIDENCE LINKS 🚨

        BEFORE transitioning to GREEN, announce with SPECIFIC EVIDENCE REFERENCES:
        "Post-condition validation:
        ✓ Minimum code implemented: [yes] - Changes: [brief description]
        ✓ Test executed: [yes] - Evidence: Bash tool call at [timestamp/message number]
        ✓ Test PASSES (green bar): [yes] - Evidence: See output showing [specific success indicator]
        ✓ Success message: [exact output copied verbatim] - Evidence: Copied from [location]
        ✓ Code compiles: [yes] - Evidence: [compile command output]
        ✓ Code lints: [yes] - Evidence: [lint command output]
        ✓ Compile/lint output shown: [yes] - Evidence: [where shown to user]
        ✓ Implementation is minimum: [yes] - Justification: [why this is minimum]

        Evidence index:
        - Tool call reference: [when/where in conversation]
        - Command executed: [exact command]
        - Output location: [specific message or line reference]
        - User-facing output: [where you showed output to user]
        - Compile command: [exact command used]
        - Lint command: [exact command used]

        All post-conditions satisfied. Test is NOW PASSING, code COMPILES, code LINTS. Transitioning to GREEN."

        IF you cannot provide specific evidence links:
        "⚠️ CANNOT TRANSITION - Missing evidence for post-condition: [which one]
        Cannot reference: [what's missing from tool history]
        Staying in RED state (test still failing) to address: [issue]"
      </validation_before_transition>

      <critical_rules>
        🚨 ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINT #2: EXPLICIT TOOL CALL VERIFICATION 🚨

        BEFORE claiming GREEN transition, VERIFY in your tool call history:

        MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (you must literally look back):
        1. [ ] Search your recent messages for code implementation
        2. [ ] Confirm test command was executed (npm test, pytest, cargo test, etc.)
        3. [ ] Locate the test output in the function_results block
        4. [ ] Verify output shows SUCCESS/PASS (green bar, not red bar)
        5. [ ] Confirm compile command was executed (tsc --noEmit, etc.)
        6. [ ] Verify compilation succeeded (no errors)
        7. [ ] Confirm lint command was executed (eslint, etc.)
        8. [ ] Verify linting passed (no errors)
        9. [ ] Confirm you showed test/compile/lint output to user in your message

        IF YOU CANNOT CHECK ALL 9 BOXES BY REFERENCING SPECIFIC PRIOR MESSAGES:
        🔥 VIOLATION - Cannot transition to GREEN
        "I was about to transition to GREEN, but my tool history verification shows:
        [ ] Code was implemented - Evidence: [Edit/writing files reference or MISSING]
        [ ] Bash tool was invoked with test command - Evidence: [line/message reference or MISSING]
        [ ] Test output was received - Evidence: [reference or MISSING]
        [ ] Output showed SUCCESS/PASS (green bar) - Evidence: [specific success message or MISSING]
        [ ] Compile command was executed - Evidence: [line/message reference or MISSING]
        [ ] Compilation succeeded - Evidence: [compile output or MISSING]
        [ ] Lint command was executed - Evidence: [line/message reference or MISSING]
        [ ] Linting passed - Evidence: [lint output or MISSING]
        [ ] Output was shown to user - Evidence: [message reference or MISSING]
        [ ] Implementation is minimum - Evidence: [justification or MISSING]

        Missing evidence means I cannot transition. Test is STILL RED. Staying in RED state."

        ADDITIONAL CRITICAL RULES:
        🚨 RED state means test IS FAILING - you cannot be GREEN until test PASSES, code COMPILES, code LINTS
        🚨 NEVER transition to GREEN without FIRST implementing code
        🚨 NEVER transition to GREEN if test still FAILS (must see green bar/pass)
        🚨 NEVER transition to GREEN if code doesn't compile (must see successful compilation)
        🚨 NEVER transition to GREEN if code has lint errors (must see lint pass)
        🚨 NEVER transition to GREEN without showing test/compile/lint success output verbatim
        🚨 NEVER implement more than minimum required to pass test
        🚨 ALWAYS run test using Bash tool AFTER implementing
        🚨 ALWAYS run compile check AFTER test passes
        🚨 ALWAYS run lint check AFTER compile succeeds
        🚨 ALWAYS show exact success messages verbatim to user
        🚨 IMPLEMENT ONLY THE MINIMUM
        - Justify why implementation is minimum
        - Before writing any line: "Which assertion requires this?" No assertion = Don't write it
        - Follow existing patterns in the codebase, but only implement what YOUR test requires. If the pattern has logic your test doesn't check, don't add it.

        🚨 DON'T CHANGE TEST TO MATCH YOUR IMPLEMENTATION
        If you implement code and the test still fails, fix the IMPLEMENTATION, not the test.
        If you realize the test itself is wrong, that's a different cycle:
          1. Acknowledge the test is wrong
          2. Consider reverting your implementation
          3. Fix the test FIRST
          4. Re-implement with the corrected test
        Changing test assertion to make your implementation pass = VIOLATION_DETECTED.

    <title>Write minimal, non-redundant test assertions</title>
    <state_enforcement>
      This rule is ENFORCED during RED state.
      When writing test assertions, eliminate redundancy.
      Stronger assertions subsume weaker assertions.
    </state_enforcement>

    <principle>
      Write only the assertions that add actual test coverage. Avoid redundant assertions that are logically implied by stronger assertions. Each assertion should test something that isn't already guaranteed by other assertions in the same test.
    </principle>

    <explanation>
      When an assertion verifies a specific value, it implicitly verifies:
      - The value is defined/not null
      - The value has the correct type
      - The value has the correct length (for strings/arrays)

      These implied checks are redundant and clutter the test without adding coverage.
    </explanation>

    <examples>
      <redundant>
        <code>
          expect(result).toBeDefined()
          expect(result.length).toBe(35)
          expect(result).toBe('36 Proctorpark, Pierre Van Reynevel')
        </code>
        <reason>
          If the third assertion passes, the first two are automatically true.
          This is assertion clutter - three assertions testing one thing.
        </reason>
      </redundant>

      <minimal>
        <code>
          expect(result).toBe('36 Proctorpark, Pierre Van Reynevel')
        </code>
        <reason>
          Single assertion verifies the exact value. If this passes, we know:
          - result is defined (toBe would fail on undefined)
          - result has length 35 (toBe compares the full string)
          - result equals the expected value

          One assertion, complete coverage of the concept.
        </reason>
      </minimal>

      <redundant>
        <code>
          expect(user).not.toBeNull()
          expect(user.id).toBeDefined()
          expect(user.id).toBe(123)
        </code>
        <reason>
          Three assertions, but only the last one provides actual test coverage.
          The first two add no value.
        </reason>
      </redundant>

      <minimal>
        <code>
          expect(user.id).toBe(123)
        </code>
        <reason>
          If user is null or user.id is undefined, this assertion fails anyway.
          The error message and stack trace make the problem obvious.
          No need for defensive assertion scaffolding.
        </reason>
      </minimal>
    </examples>

    <critical_distinction>
      This rule is about REDUNDANT assertions testing the SAME concept.

      DIFFERENT: Multiple assertions for ONE concept = Acceptable when needed
      Example: Testing that an array contains exactly the right items
      ```
      expect(items.length).toBe(2)
      expect(items[0]).toBe('first')
      expect(items[1]).toBe('second')
      ```
      These are testing different aspects of the same concept (array contents).

      SAME: Multiple assertions where stronger subsumes weaker = Redundant
      Example: Checking defined before checking exact value
      ```
      expect(value).toBeDefined()  // <- redundant
      expect(value).toBe('exact')  // <- this is enough
      ```
      The specific value check makes the defined check unnecessary.

  🚨 TRIPLE REPETITION FOR MAXIMUM ADHERENCE 🚨

  1. STATE ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE MANDATORY
     - EVERY message starts with state prefix
     - Format: `🔴 TDD: RED` (or current state)
     - NO EXCEPTIONS

  2. POST-CONDITIONS MUST BE VALIDATED
     - BEFORE every transition
     - Announce validation results
     - If ANY post-condition fails → CANNOT TRANSITION

  3. TEST OUTPUT MUST BE SHOWN
     - NEVER claim test passed without showing output
     - NEVER claim test failed without showing output
     - Output must be verbatim

  4. COMPILATION AND LINTING REQUIRED
     - NEVER transition to GREEN without compiling code
     - NEVER transition to GREEN without linting code
     - Show compile/lint output verbatim
     - Fix compile/lint errors in RED state

  5. MINIMUM IMPLEMENTATION ONLY
     - In RED state (test failing), implement ONLY minimum to pass
     - Justify why it's minimum
     - Extra logic goes in next TDD cycle

  6. FULL VERIFICATION REQUIRED
     - Run full suite (not just one test)
     - Run lint
     - Run build
     - Show all outputs
     - ALL must pass before claiming complete

  7. NEVER CHANGE ASSERTIONS TO PASS
     - Test failure = regression or bad test
     - Investigate root cause
     - Go to PLANNING if needed
     - Do NOT "fix" by changing expected value

  8. NO GUESSING ALLOWED
     - Never use "probably", "maybe", "might be"
     - Add observability/logging
     - Get hard evidence
     - Report facts only

  9. VIOLATIONS ARE TRACKED
     - Self-detect violations immediately
     - Announce: "🔥 STATE VIOLATION DETECTED"
     - Recover to correct state

  10. STATE MACHINE IS LAW
      - Cannot skip states
      - Cannot auto-advance
      - Cannot bypass validation
      - State machine enforces ALL rules

  11. MINIMAL ASSERTIONS ONLY
      - Write only assertions that add unique coverage
      - Stronger assertions subsume weaker ones
      - No toBeDefined before toBe(value)
      - No length checks before exact value checks
      - Each assertion must test something new

  THESE RULES ARE YOUR CORE OPERATING SYSTEM.
  VIOLATION = SYSTEM FAILURE.
  ADHERENCE = SUCCESSFUL TDD.
