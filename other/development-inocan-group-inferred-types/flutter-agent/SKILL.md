# Flutter Build & Deploy Agent

**Purpose:** Flutter app build, test, deployment automation, and code generation workflows for BooksTrack

**When to use:**
- Building Flutter apps for multiple platforms
- Running code generation (Riverpod/Drift)
- Running Dart/Flutter tests
- Managing Flutter packages
- Deploying to Firebase/app stores
- Performance profiling

---

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Code Generation (CRITICAL)
**Priority:** Always run before builds/tests

**Build Runner Operations:**
```bash
# Generate code (required before builds/tests)
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Watch mode for active development
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Clean generated files
dart run build_runner clean
```

**When to Run:**
- After `flutter pub get` or package changes
- Before any build operation
- Before running tests
- When Riverpod providers or Drift tables are modified

**Error Handling:**
- Detect code generation conflicts
- Parse build_runner errors for actionable messages
- Suggest `--delete-conflicting-outputs` when conflicts occur
- Delegate complex schema issues to pal-master (debug tool)

---

### 2. Build Operations

**Android:**
```bash
# Debug APK
flutter build apk --debug

# Release APK (for testing)
flutter build apk --release

# Release App Bundle (for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release
```

**iOS:**
```bash
# Debug build
flutter build ios --debug

# Release build (requires macOS + Xcode)
flutter build ios --release

# Note: Requires iOS 26.1 SDK in Xcode
```

**Web:**
```bash
# Debug build
flutter build web

# Release build
flutter build web --release

# With Firebase hosting deployment
flutter build web --release && firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**macOS (Known Issue):**
```bash
# Attempt build (currently fails due to gRPC incompatibility)
flutter build macos --release

# Error handling:
# - Detect "clang: error: unsupported option '-G'" error
# - Report as known gRPC issue with macOS 26.1 Sequoia
# - Continue with other platform builds
# - Reference: CLAUDE.md lines 302-307
```

**Build Workflows:**
```bash
# Complete build workflow
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build <platform> --release
```

---

### 3. Testing

**Unit Tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/features/library/library_screen_test.dart

# Generate coverage report
flutter test --coverage

# Watch mode for TDD
flutter test --watch
```

**Integration Tests:**
```bash
# Run integration tests
flutter test integration_test/

# Run on specific device
flutter test integration_test/ -d <device-id>
```

**Test Coverage:**
```bash
# Generate and view coverage
flutter test --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
open coverage/html/index.html  # macOS
```

---

### 4. Firebase Integration

**Web Hosting Deployment:**
```bash
# Complete web deployment workflow
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflating-outputs
flutter build web --release
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Firebase Emulators (Testing):**
```bash
# Start emulators for local testing
firebase emulators:start

# Run tests against emulators
firebase emulators:exec "flutter test integration_test/"
```

**Complex Firebase Operations:**
- Delegate Firestore security rules to pal-master (secaudit tool)
- Delegate Firebase Auth configuration to pal-master
- Handle autonomous: Simple hosting deploys, emulator management

---

### 5. Package Management

**Dependency Operations:**
```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Update packages
flutter pub upgrade

# Check for outdated packages
flutter pub outdated

# Show dependency tree
flutter pub deps --style=compact

# Resolve conflicts
flutter pub deps --json | grep conflict
```

**After Package Updates:**
1. Run `flutter pub get`
2. Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
3. Run `flutter analyze`
4. Run tests to verify compatibility

---

### 6. Code Quality

**Analysis:**
```bash
# Analyze entire project
flutter analyze

# Analyze with verbose output
flutter analyze --verbose

# Check for specific files
flutter analyze lib/features/library/
```

**Formatting:**
```bash
# Format all Dart files
dart format .

# Format specific directory
dart format lib/features/

# Check formatting without changes
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .
```

**Dart Analyzer:**
```bash
# Detailed analysis
dart analyze

# With machine-readable output
dart analyze --format=machine
```

---

### 7. Development Tools

**Hot Reload/Restart:**
```bash
# Run with hot reload enabled
flutter run -d <device-id> --hot

# Profile mode for performance testing
flutter run --profile

# Release mode
flutter run --release
```

**Device Management:**
```bash
# List available devices
flutter devices

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d macos
flutter run -d chrome
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

**Performance Profiling:**
```bash
# Run in profile mode
flutter run --profile

# Enable Skia tracing for detailed frame analysis
flutter run --trace-skia --profile

# Generate performance timeline
flutter run --profile --trace-startup
```

**Dependency Conflict Resolution:**
```bash
# Show dependency tree
flutter pub deps

# Identify conflicts
flutter pub deps --style=compact | grep '✗'

# Delegate complex conflicts to pal-master
# (Use analyze or debug tool for resolution strategies)
```

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### iOS Requirements
- macOS required for builds
- Xcode with iOS 26.1 SDK
- Valid signing certificates for release builds
- **Escalate to human:** App Store submissions, signing issues

### Android Requirements
- No platform restrictions
- APK for testing, App Bundle for Play Store
- Configure signing keys for release builds
- **Escalate to human:** Play Store submissions

### Web Requirements
- Firebase CLI installed for hosting deployment
- Firebase project configured (`firebase init`)
- Build outputs to `build/web/`

### macOS (Currently Limited)
- Known Issue: gRPC incompatibility with macOS 26.1 Sequoia
- Error: `clang: error: unsupported option '-G' for target 'arm64-apple-macos10.12'`
- Workaround: Test on iOS/Android/Web instead
- Track: Firebase/Flutter upstream issue

## Common Workflows

### New Feature Development
```bash
# 1. Start watch mode for code generation
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs

# 2. Run app with hot reload
flutter run -d <device> --hot

# 3. Make changes, hot reload automatically applies
# Press 'r' for manual hot reload
# Press 'R' for hot restart
```

### Pre-Commit Workflow
```bash
# 1. Generate code
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# 2. Format code
dart format .

# 3. Analyze
flutter analyze

# 4. Run tests
flutter test

# 5. Delegate to pal-master for code review
# (Use precommit tool for comprehensive validation)
```

### Release Build Workflow
```bash
# 1. Update dependencies
flutter pub get

# 2. Generate code
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# 3. Run full test suite
flutter test

# 4. Build for all platforms
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release
flutter build ios --release
flutter build web --release
# flutter build macos --release  # Skip due to gRPC issue

# 5. Deploy web (if applicable)
firebase deploy --only hosting

# 6. Escalate to human for app store submissions
```

### Debugging Workflow
```bash
# 1. Reproduce issue in debug mode
flutter run -d <device>

# 2. If build fails, check code generation
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# 3. If complex, delegate to pal-master
# (Use debug tool for systematic investigation)

# 4. After fix, validate with tests
flutter test
```

## Integration with Other Agents

### Delegates to pal-master for:
- **Code Review:** `codereview` tool for Dart/Flutter best practices
- **Security Review:** `codereview` tool (review_type: security) for Firebase rules, API keys
- **Complex Debugging:** `debug` tool for mysterious Flutter/Dart issues
- **Dependency Analysis:** `thinkdeep` tool for complex dependency graphs
- **Pre-Commit Validation:** `precommit` tool for comprehensive change review
- **Architecture Analysis:** `thinkdeep` tool for widget rebuild optimization

### Receives delegation from project-manager for:
- Build/test/deploy requests
- Flutter-specific operations
- Multi-platform builds
- Code generation workflows
- Firebase deployment
- Development tool operations (hot reload, profiling)

### Escalates to human for:
- App Store/Play Store submissions
- Signing certificate issues
- Firebase project configuration
- Breaking changes in dependencies
- macOS build issues (until gRPC fixed)

## Error Handling Strategies

### Code Generation Errors
```
Error: Existing outputs found...
→ Solution: Run with --delete-conflicting-outputs
→ If persists: Clean and rebuild
```

### Build Errors
```
Error: No Material widget found...
→ Solution: Check widget tree, wrap with MaterialApp
→ Delegate: pal-master (debug tool)
```

### macOS Build Failure
```
Error: clang: error: unsupported option '-G'...
→ Solution: Skip macOS builds (known gRPC issue)
→ Report: Known issue, test on other platforms
→ Track: Upstream Firebase/Flutter resolution
```

### Dependency Conflicts
```
Error: Version solving failed...
→ Solution: Run `flutter pub deps` to identify conflicts
→ Delegate: pal-master (analyze tool) for complex conflicts
```

### Test Failures
```
Error: Test failed...
→ Solution: Run specific test in isolation
→ Delegate: pal-master (debug tool) for complex failures
```

## Best Practices for BooksTrack Project

### Always Run Code Generation First
- Riverpod providers use `@riverpod` annotation (requires generation)
- Drift database uses table classes (requires generation)
- **Never build/test without running build_runner**

### Multi-Platform Testing Strategy
1. Primary testing: iOS + Android
2. Secondary: Web
3. Skip: macOS (until gRPC fixed)
4. Use `flutter devices` to verify available platforms

### Firebase Deployment
- Web builds deploy to Firebase Hosting
- Always test locally with `firebase emulators` first
- Delegate security rules review to pal-master

### Performance Monitoring
- Use `--profile` mode for performance testing
- Monitor image caching (CachedNetworkImage with memCache sizes)
- Profile database queries (Drift watch streams)

### Development Velocity
- Keep `build_runner watch` running during active development
- Use hot reload for UI changes
- Use hot restart for state management changes
- Escalate to full rebuild only when necessary

**Autonomy Level:** High - Can build, test, generate code, and deploy autonomously
**Human Escalation:** Required for app store submissions, signing certificates, Firebase project config
**CRITICAL:** Always run `dart run build_runner build` before builds/tests for BooksTrack
**Known Limitation:** macOS builds currently fail due to gRPC incompatibility with macOS 26.1 Sequoia
