# Land-Adopt-Expand Blueprint Skill

## When to Use
- Designing success plans for enterprise SaaS accounts.
- Aligning revenue, product, and CS teams on phased adoption metrics.
- Auditing current accounts to identify expansion triggers or risks.

## Framework
1. **Stakeholder Matrix** – map economic, technical, and champion roles per phase.
2. **Milestone Ladder** – land (business case, pilot), adopt (activation, value proof), expand (multi-product, exec advocacy).
3. **Signal Library** – telemetry + qualitative indicators that unlock stage gates.
4. **Governance Cadence** – EBR/QBR schedule, exec sponsors, escalation paths.
5. **Action Playbook** – recommended plays, assets, and enablement per milestone.

## Templates
- Success plan table with phases, KPIs, owners, and timelines.
- Exec summary slide for internal standups.
- Risk/mitigation log tied to each phase.

## Tips
- Tie stage gates to measurable outcomes, not just time-based milestones.
- Share blueprint with customers to co-author success plans.
- Pair with `build-land-adopt-expand-plan` for account-specific automation.
