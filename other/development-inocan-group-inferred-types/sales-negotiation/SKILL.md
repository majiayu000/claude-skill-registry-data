    competitive_bid:
      tactic: "We're evaluating multiple vendors"
      response: "What criteria matter most to you?"
      counter: "Focus on unique value, not just price"

```

## Concession Strategy

```yaml
concession_principles:
  never_free:
    rule: "Every concession requires something in return"
    examples:
      - "Happy to reduce price by 10% for 3-year term"
      - "We can waive setup fee if you sign this week"
      - "I can include premium support for annual payment"

  diminishing_size:
    pattern: "Each concession smaller than the last"
    example:
      first: "5% discount"
      second: "3% additional"
      third: "1% final"
    message: "Signals you're reaching limit"

  trade_unequal_value:
    concept: "Give what's cheap to you, valuable to them"
    examples:
      - "Training (low cost, high value)"
      - "Extended payment terms"
      - "Additional user licenses"
      - "Implementation support"

concession_trades:
  if_you_give:
    - "Lower price"
    - "Extended payment terms"
    - "Free add-ons"
    - "Waived fees"
    - "Extra support"

  ask_for:
    - "Longer contract term"
    - "Upfront payment"
    - "Case study/reference"
    - "Expanded scope"
    - "Faster decision"
    - "Executive sponsor"
    - "Referral commitment"
```

## Closing Techniques

```yaml
closing_approaches:
  assumptive_close:
    technique: "Assume the sale, discuss implementation"
    example: "So for onboarding, would you prefer to start
              with the sales team or marketing team first?"
    when: "Strong buying signals present"

  alternative_close:
    technique: "Offer two positive options"
    example: "Would you prefer the annual plan with 20% savings,
              or the quarterly plan for flexibility?"
    when: "Decision is about 'which', not 'if'"

  summary_close:
    technique: "Recap value and ask for commitment"
    example: "So we've agreed this solves [problem], will save
              [amount], and integrates with [system].
              Shall we move forward?"
    when: "After thorough discovery and demo"

  urgency_close:
    technique: "Create legitimate time pressure"
    example: "We have capacity for implementation this month.
              Next available slot would be Q2.
              Does this timeline work?"
    when: "Real deadline or constraint exists"

  trial_close:
    technique: "Test readiness before asking"
    example: "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you
              this solves your problem?"
    when: "Uncertain about objections"

  puppy_dog_close:
    technique: "Let them experience before deciding"
    example: "Why don't you try it for 30 days and see
              how the team likes it?"
    when: "Product sells itself through use"

  sharp_angle_close:
    technique: "Turn their request into commitment"
    example: "If I can get you that feature by Q2,
              can we sign today?"
    when: "They make a specific request"

buying_signals:
  verbal:
    - "What are the next steps?"
    - "How soon can we start?"
    - "Can you send the contract?"
    - "What's the implementation timeline?"
    - "Who do we need to involve?"

  behavioral:
    - "Asking detailed questions"
    - "Involving additional stakeholders"
    - "Discussing internal processes"
    - "Comparing options openly"
    - "Leaning in, engaged"
```

## Competitive Displacement

```yaml

    flanking:
      when: "Strength in specific area"
      approach: "Reframe evaluation criteria"

    niche:
      when: "Specialized capability"
      approach: "Focus on unique use case"

  competitive_questions:
    discovery:
      - "What solutions have you looked at?"
      - "What do you like about your current provider?"
      - "What would you change if you could?"
      - "When is your contract up?"

    positioning:
      - "What would make you consider alternatives?"
      - "What's missing from current solution?"
      - "How do they compare on [your strength]?"

  handling_competitive_situations:
    when_behind:
      - "Understand their evaluation criteria"
      - "Find unique differentiator"
      - "Offer proof of concept"
      - "Go higher/wider in organization"
      - "Focus on long-term partnership"

    when_ahead:
      - "Don't get complacent"
      - "Accelerate timeline"
      - "Lock in champion"
      - "Address all concerns"
      - "Make switching cost clear"

  competitive_landmines:
    concept: "Questions that expose competitor weakness"
    examples:
      - "Ask about [feature they lack]"
      - "Ask about [support issue they have]"
      - "Ask about [scalability problem]"
      - "Ask about [security concern]"
```
