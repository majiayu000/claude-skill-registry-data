# Success Planning Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Kicking off strategic accounts, renewals, or large expansions.
- Preparing QBR/EBR sessions that require clear impact narratives.
- Aligning internal and customer stakeholders on joint execution plans.

## Framework
1. **Objective Definition** – document customer outcomes, KPIs, and time horizons.
2. **Milestone Architecture** – break objectives into measurable milestones with owners.
3. **Governance Layer** – set review cadence, communication channels, and escalation triggers.
4. **Proof & Assets** – link data, case studies, product roadmap elements required per milestone.
5. **Measurement & Feedback** – capture progress, blockers, and new opportunities each cycle.

## Templates
- **Success Plan Canvas**: See `assets/success_plan_canvas.md` for objectives and milestones.
- **Success plan table** (objective, milestone, KPI, owner, due date).
- **Governance charter outline** (cadence, audience, agenda, inputs).
- Risk/action log with status + accountability.

## Tips
- Keep milestones customer-value focused before internal metrics.
- Co-create live with stakeholders to drive commitment.
- Pair with `account-health-framework` outputs to keep signals current.
