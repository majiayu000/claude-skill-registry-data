# Writing Taste

Use this skill when a request is about writing or editing documents, guidelines, or long form explanations.

## Rules

- Avoid patchy phrasing such as bracketed afterthoughts or parenthetical patches.
- Prefer direct statements over hedging or filler.
- Keep structure explicit and consistent.
- Remove redundant qualifiers and duplicated terms.

## Workflow

1) Identify the document goal and audience.
2) Choose a structure that matches the goal.
3) Write plain statements first, then tighten.
4) Remove patchy language and replace it with direct clauses.
5) Check tone, consistency, and length against the goal.
