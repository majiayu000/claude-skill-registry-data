# Launch Tiering Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Evaluating upcoming releases to determine Tier 1/2/3 scope.
- Aligning stakeholders on budget, channels, and required deliverables.
- Documenting launch expectations for planning, approvals, and reporting.

## Framework
1. **Impact Criteria** – ARR target, product scope, audience reach, competitive urgency.
2. **Resource Requirements** – channels activated, creative/engineering effort, regional needs.
3. **Governance Level** – exec involvement, war-room cadence, risk tolerance.
4. **Instrumentation** – telemetry readiness, reporting complexity, experimentation.
5. **Compliance & Dependencies** – legal/security review, partner commitments, support readiness.

## Templates
- Tier scoring matrix (criteria, weights, thresholds, recommended resourcing).
- Tier playbook (required workstreams, artifacts, checkpoints, reporting).
- Approval checklist for tier changes or escalations.

## Tips
- Reassess tier mid-cycle if scope or market conditions shift.
- Maintain a historical log of tier decisions for future benchmarking.
- Tie tier definitions to budgeting + staffing models to ensure consistency.
