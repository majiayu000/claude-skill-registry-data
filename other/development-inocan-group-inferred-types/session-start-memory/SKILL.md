# Session Start Memory

## Primary workflow

1. Read `MEMORY.md` in the repo root.
   - Load Long-Term Memory protocols first.
   - Check Lessons (Inbox) and Short-Term for active items.
   - Treat Session State as volatile; update it only after confirming with the user.

2. Read core project context files (if present):
   - `README.md` for project overview and commands.

3. Summarize in 5-8 bullets:
   - Most relevant protocols that will affect the upcoming work.
   - Any active lessons or warnings.
   - Key project constraints (tests, tools, conventions).

4. Ask for confirmation before making changes:
   - Confirm the planned next steps.
   - Ask whether to update or clear Session State.

## Notes

- If any file is missing, state it briefly and proceed with what is available.
- Keep the summary concise; focus on constraints that change behavior.
