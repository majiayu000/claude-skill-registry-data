# Athena PR Reviewer

## Instructions

### 1. Detect PR Target

Parse user input to identify the PR:

- **Direct PR reference** (`PR 123`, `#123`): Extract number directly
- **Jira ticket** (`PROJ-123`): Run `gh pr list --search "PROJ-123" --json number --jq '.[0].number'`
- **Current branch**: Run `gh pr view --json number --jq '.number'`
- **No PR found**: Extract Jira from branch with `git branch --show-current | grep -oE '[A-Z]+-[0-9]+'`

### 2. Gather Data (Script)

Run the gather-context script which collects all data in parallel:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer/scripts/gather-context.sh ${PR_NUM} ${JIRA_TICKET}
```

This script:
- Creates work directory at `/tmp/athena-review-${PR_NUM}/`
- Fetches in parallel: PR metadata, diff, Jira ticket, epic, CLAUDE.md guidelines, git blame, prior PR comments
- Writes combined context to `${WORK_DIR}/context.md`
- Writes diff to `${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch`

Output files:
- `context.md` - Combined PR + Jira + guidelines + history data
- `diff.patch` - Full PR diff
- `pr.json` - Raw PR metadata
- `jira.json` - Raw Jira ticket data
- `epic.json` - Epic context (if linked)
- `guidelines.md` - All CLAUDE.md files from repo
- `blame.md` - Git blame for changed files (who wrote what, when)
- `prior-comments.md` - Comments from past PRs touching same files

### 3. Detect and Select Reviewers

Before running reviews, detect available reviewer agents and let the user select which to use.

#### 3.1 Detect Available Reviewers

**Built-in reviewers (always available):**
- 6 Claude specialists: comment-analyzer, test-analyzer, error-hunter, type-reviewer, code-reviewer, simplifier
- External LLMs: Gemini, Codex (auto-detected by run-reviews.sh)

**Dynamic reviewers:**
Check available `subagent_type` values in your context for additional reviewers:
1. Pattern match - Find agents where name or description contains "reviewer" or "review"
2. Exclude: `athena-pr-reviewer` (this skill), data-gathering agents (hermes-pr-courier, heimdall-pr-guardian, etc.)

#### 3.2 Confirm or Customize Reviewers

First, show all detected reviewers and ask for confirmation:

```
I'll run the review with these agents:

**Claude specialists (6):** (built-in, always available)
- comment-analyzer, test-analyzer, error-hunter
- type-reviewer, code-reviewer, simplifier

**External LLMs (2):** (run outside Claude via CLI)
- Gemini, Codex

**Installed agents (N):** (detected in your Claude setup)
- {agent-1}, {agent-2}, ...
- (or "None detected" if empty)

Proceed with all {total} reviewers?
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` with:
- **Yes, run all** (Recommended) - Proceed with all detected reviewers
- **No, let me choose** - Show detailed selection UI

#### 3.3 Handle Response

**If "Yes, run all":** Proceed to step 4 with all detected reviewers.

**If "No, let me choose":** Show paginated multi-select UI:

- Max 4 options per question, max 4 questions per call
- Each batch shows "All in this batch" + 3 actual reviewers
- Use `multiSelect: true`
- Group by category (Built-in specialists, External agents, Dynamic agents)

Parse selection:
- If "All in this batch" selected → include all reviewers from that batch
- Otherwise include only individually selected reviewers

### 4. Run Reviews (Selected Reviewers in Parallel)

Execute all selected reviews simultaneously in a SINGLE message.

**In ONE message, run all selected reviewers:**

#### 4.1 External LLMs (if selected)

If Gemini or Codex were selected, start with `run_in_background: true`:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer/scripts/run-reviews.sh ${WORK_DIR}
```

#### 4.2 Built-in Claude Specialists (if selected)

For each selected built-in specialist, spawn a Task agent:

| Specialist | Prompt File | Output File |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| comment-analyzer | `prompts/comment-analyzer.md` | `claude-comments.md` |
| test-analyzer | `prompts/test-analyzer.md` | `claude-tests.md` |
| error-hunter | `prompts/error-hunter.md` | `claude-errors.md` |
| type-reviewer | `prompts/type-reviewer.md` | `claude-types.md` |
| code-reviewer | `prompts/code-reviewer.md` | `claude-general.md` |
| simplifier | `prompts/simplifier.md` | `claude-simplify.md` |

```
Task: general-purpose
Prompt: "Read ~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer/prompts/{SPECIALIST}.md for instructions.
Then read ${WORK_DIR}/context.md and ${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch.
Perform the review and use the Write tool to save your findings to: ${WORK_DIR}/reviews/{OUTPUT_FILE}
IMPORTANT: Use the Write tool directly, not Bash with cat/heredoc."
```

**Note: Each Task call returns a `task_id`. Save these - you will need them in step 4.4.**

#### 4.3 Dynamic Reviewer Agents (if selected)

For each selected dynamic agent, spawn using its own agent type:

```
Task: {agent-name}
Prompt: "Review the PR for code quality issues.

Context file: ${WORK_DIR}/context.md (contains requirements, PR metadata, guidelines)
Diff file: ${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch (annotated with line numbers)

Use your expertise to identify issues. For each finding include:
- File path and line number (use format from diff annotations)
- Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- Confidence: 0-100
- Description and suggested fix

Use the Write tool to save your review to: ${WORK_DIR}/reviews/{agent-name}.md
IMPORTANT: Use the Write tool directly, not Bash with cat/heredoc."
```

**Note: Each Task call returns a `task_id`. Save these - you will need them in step 4.4.**

#### 4.4 Wait for ALL Agents to Complete

**STOP. Do NOT proceed until you complete this step.**

When you spawned Task agents in steps 4.1-4.3, each returned a `task_id`. You MUST now:

1. **List all task IDs** you received from spawning agents
2. **For EACH task_id, call TaskOutput:**
   ```
   TaskOutput(task_id: "abc123", block: true)
   TaskOutput(task_id: "def456", block: true)
   TaskOutput(task_id: "ghi789", block: true)
   ... one call per spawned agent
   ```
3. **Do NOT skip any** - even if you see some agent output appear automatically

**FORBIDDEN:**
- ❌ Proceeding when "most" agents are done
- ❌ Relying on automatic output appearing
- ❌ Skipping TaskOutput for agents that seem fast
- ❌ Moving to Step 5 before ALL TaskOutput calls return

**REQUIRED:**
- ✓ Call TaskOutput for EVERY spawned agent
- ✓ Use `block: true` on each call
- ✓ Wait for each call to return before proceeding

Only after ALL TaskOutput calls have returned, proceed to Step 5.

### 5. Aggregate Reviews

Read ALL review files from `${WORK_DIR}/reviews/` directory and combine findings.

**Possible reviewers (depending on selection):**
- External: gemini.md, codex.md
- Built-in: claude-comments.md, claude-tests.md, claude-errors.md, claude-types.md, claude-general.md, claude-simplify.md
- Dynamic: {agent-name}.md (any additional detected agents)

**Confidence Filtering:**
- Drop findings with confidence < 80
- Keep findings 50-79 only if flagged by 2+ reviewers

**Priority Boost Rule:** Items flagged by 2+ reviewers get bumped up one severity level.

| Reviewers | Original | Final Severity |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 3+        | High     | Critical       |
| 2         | High     | Critical       |
| 3+        | Medium   | High           |
| 2         | Medium   | High           |
| 1         | Any      | No boost       |

Deduplicate similar findings, noting which reviewer(s) flagged each and average confidence.

### 5.5 Verify Findings

For each aggregated finding, verify against actual code to filter hallucinations:

1. Read `${WORK_DIR}/diff.patch` to get the actual code
2. For each finding with file:line reference:
   - Extract the actual code at that location from the diff
   - Compare the finding's description to what the code actually does
3. Use the verifier prompt (`~/.claude/skills/athena-pr-reviewer/prompts/verifier.md`) to validate each finding
4. Filter based on verdict:
   - **✓ VERIFIED** → Keep in final output
   - **✗ REJECTED** → Write to `${WORK_DIR}/rejected.md` with reason
   - **⚠️ PARTIAL** → Keep but move to "Suggestions" section

Output verified findings to `${WORK_DIR}/verified-findings.md`

### 6. Synthesize Actionable Items

Present combined review to user:

```markdown
# PR Review: {PR_TITLE} (#{PR_NUM})

## Requirements Status
| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|

## Action Items (Verified)

### Critical (consensus, verified)
- [ ] file:line - issue - fix [reviewer1 + reviewer2 + reviewer3] (3+, avg 92%) ✓

### High Priority (verified)
- [ ] file:line - issue - fix [reviewer1 + reviewer2] ← boosted (2, avg 85%) ✓
- [ ] file:line - issue - fix [reviewer1] (95%) ✓

### Medium Priority (verified)
- [ ] file:line - issue - fix [reviewer1] (88%) ✓

### Suggestions
- improvements (including PARTIAL findings downgraded from higher severity)

## Rejected Findings
Findings that failed verification are saved to: `${WORK_DIR}/rejected.md`

## Review Sources
[List all .md files found in ${WORK_DIR}/reviews/]

## Recommendation: APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES
```

### 7. Offer Deep Dive

After presenting the summary, offer to iterate through action items:

```
Would you like me to walk through any of these issues in detail? I can:
- Explain each issue with more context
- Show the actual code and a potential fix
- Give my opinion on priority and approach

Reply with "yes" to go through them one by one, or pick specific items (e.g., "explain the first critical issue").
```

If the user accepts, go through items **ONE AT A TIME**:

For each item:
1. Show the relevant code snippet from the diff
2. Explain why it's problematic with more context
3. Propose a concrete fix with code
4. Share your opinion on severity and whether it's a blocker

**CRITICAL: After presenting ONE item, STOP and wait for user input.**

Ask: "Ready for the next issue? (N remaining)" or let them say "skip", "stop", or ask questions about the current item.

Do NOT present multiple items in a single response.
