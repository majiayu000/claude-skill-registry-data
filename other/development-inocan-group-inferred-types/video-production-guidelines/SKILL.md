## Apple Keynote Methodology: Four Core Principles

### Principle 1: One Message Per Scene

**Each scene communicates a single idea.**

**Why:** Human brain processes information sequentially. Multiple messages = confusion. Single message = clarity and retention.

**❌ Bad - Multiple features in one scene:**
```
Scene 3: MYCURE Features
VISUAL: Dashboard showing all modules
AUDIO: "MYCURE has auto-fill, real-time validation, cross-module sync,
       FHISIS reporting, inventory tracking, and appointment reminders."

Problem: 6 features in 1 scene - viewer overwhelmed, remembers nothing
```

**✅ Good - One feature per scene:**
```
Scene 3: Auto-Fill Feature
VISUAL: Registration form auto-filling patient data
AUDIO: "MYCURE's auto-fill saves 70% of data entry time."

Scene 4: Real-Time Validation
VISUAL: Validation checking fields as user types
AUDIO: "Real-time validation catches errors before they become problems."

Scene 5: Cross-Module Sync
VISUAL: Data flowing between Registration and Billing modules
AUDIO: "Data syncs instantly across all modules."

Result: 3 clear, memorable messages
```

**Test your scene:** Ask "What ONE thing do I want viewers to remember?"
- Single idea → Good scene
- Multiple ideas → Split into multiple scenes
- Unclear → Refocus or cut

---

### Principle 2: Visual Supports Audio (Doesn't Duplicate)

**Visuals and audio complement, not repeat.**

**Why:** Redundancy wastes cognitive bandwidth. Visual-audio harmony doubles impact.
- Audio explains WHY (concept, benefit, reason)
- Visual shows HOW (demonstration, proof, example)

**❌ Bad - Redundant text:**
```
VISUAL: [GRAPHIC: "MYCURE automates patient registration"]
AUDIO: "MYCURE automates patient registration."

Problem: Reading same text while hearing it - redundant, boring
```

**✅ Good - Complementary streams:**
```
VISUAL: [B-ROLL: Patient form auto-filling in 3 seconds]
AUDIO: "MYCURE automates patient registration."

VISUAL: [B-ROLL: Receptionist registering 10 patients quickly]
AUDIO: "That's 70% less time on data entry."

Result: Visual PROVES claim, audio EXPLAINS benefit - impactful
```

**When text overlays ARE okay:**
1. Statistics ("73% of clinics", "10 hours saved")
2. Key terms (technical words to remember)
3. CTAs (contact info, demo links)
4. Lower thirds (names, titles, locations)

**Text overlay rules:**
- 5-7 words maximum
- High contrast (readable)
- On screen 3-5 seconds minimum

---

### Principle 3: The 3-Second Rule

**Every visual element must be on screen at least 3 seconds.**

**Why:** Human visual processing timeline:
- 0-1s: Brain registers change
- 1-2s: Brain identifies what it's seeing
- 2-3s: Brain understands meaning
- 3+s: Brain integrates information

**Timing guidelines:**
- Text overlays: 3-5 seconds minimum
- Graphics: 3-4 seconds minimum
- B-roll shots: 3-6 seconds per shot
- Transitions: 0.5-1 second (quick, don't linger)
- Scene changes: 10+ seconds minimum

**❌ Bad - Rapid cuts:**
```
[B-ROLL: Typing - 1 second]
[B-ROLL: Clicking - 1 second]
[B-ROLL: Scrolling - 1 second]
[B-ROLL: Saving - 1 second]

Problem: 4 shots in 4 seconds - can't process, feels hectic
```

**✅ Good - Sustained shots:**
```
[B-ROLL: Wide shot of typing, clicking, saving - 6 seconds]
[B-ROLL: Close-up of successful save confirmation - 4 seconds]

Result: 2 shots in 10 seconds - viewer processes information calmly
```

---

### Principle 4: Progressive Disclosure

**Reveal information in layers, building anticipation.**

**Why:** Matches natural learning progression. Creates curiosity. Maintains engagement.

**Structure:**
1. **Tease** - Hint at solution without revealing
2. **Problem** - Establish pain point viewer relates to
3. **Solution** - Reveal MYCURE as answer
4. **Demonstration** - Show solution in action
5. **Benefit** - Quantify impact
6. **CTA** - Direct next step

**Example progression:**
```
Scene 1 (Tease): "What if patient registration took 5 minutes instead of 15?"
Scene 2 (Problem): "Manual registration wastes 10 hours weekly for most clinics."
Scene 3 (Solution): "MYCURE's Registration module automates the process."
Scene 4 (Demo): [Show auto-fill, validation, sync in action]
Scene 5 (Benefit): "Clinics save 8 hours per week. That's an entire workday."
Scene 6 (CTA): "Book a free demo at mycure.md"
```

## Two-Column AV Script Format

### Why This Format?

**Industry standard** used by documentaries, corporate video, TV production.

**Benefits:**
1. **Clear separation** - Director knows what to shoot, narrator knows what to read
2. **Parallel development** - Visual and audio teams work simultaneously
3. **Precise timing** - Word count ÷ 2.5 = seconds of narration
4. **Easy review** - Stakeholders can visualize without seeing video

```

---

## Visual Column Notation

### Scene Descriptions

**Format:** `[SCENE X: Description]`

**Include:**
- What's visible on screen
- Key UI elements highlighted
- Visual focus point

**Examples:**
```
[SCENE 1: MYCURE dashboard, all 6 modules visible, clean interface]
[SCENE 3: Registration form, empty with cursor in "Name" field]
[SCENE 7: Inventory showing real-time stock across 3 locations]
```

### B-Roll Footage

**Format:** `[B-ROLL: Action or subject]`

**B-roll = supplementary footage supporting voiceover**

**Examples:**
```
[B-ROLL: Hands typing "Maria Santos" into patient name field]
[B-ROLL: Clinic receptionist smiling at patient]
[B-ROLL: Cursor clicking "Save" button, confirmation appears]
[B-ROLL: Medicine bottles on clinic shelf]
```

**When to use B-roll:**
- Demonstrate user actions (typing, clicking)
- Show real-world context (clinic, staff, patients)
- Illustrate abstract concepts (efficiency = fast activity)
- Add visual variety

### Graphics & Overlays

**Format:** `[GRAPHIC: "Text" or description]`

**Examples:**
```
[GRAPHIC: "70% time savings" fades in]
[GRAPHIC: Arrow pointing to "Auto-fill" button]
[GRAPHIC: Checkmark animation]
[GRAPHIC: Lower third - "Dr. Maria Santos, General Practitioner"]
```

---

## Audio Column Notation

### Voiceover

**Format:** `[VOICEOVER] Script text...`

**Writing guidelines:**
- Conversational tone (write how people speak)
- Short sentences (10-15 words max)
- Active voice ("MYCURE saves time" not "Time is saved by MYCURE")
- Contractions okay ("it's", "you'll", "that's")

**Timing calculation:**
- Average speaking pace: 150 words per minute
- Conversational pace: 2.5 words per second
- **Formula:** Word count ÷ 2.5 = seconds

**Examples:**
```
[VOICEOVER] Manual registration takes 15 minutes per patient.
(8 words ÷ 2.5 = 3.2 seconds)

[VOICEOVER] MYCURE's auto-fill feature saves 70% of that time.
(9 words ÷ 2.5 = 3.6 seconds)
```

### Music Cues

**Format:** `[MUSIC: Description]`

**Types:**
- `[MUSIC: Upbeat background begins]` - Scene opens
- `[MUSIC: Swells]` - Emphasize key moment
- `[MUSIC: Fades out]` - Scene closes
- `[MUSIC: Transition]` - Between scenes

**Music guidelines:**
- Instrumental only (no lyrics compete with voiceover)
- Non-intrusive (viewer barely notices it consciously)
- Royalty-free or licensed (Epidemic Sound, Artlist, AudioJungle)
- Match mood (upbeat for benefits, calm for education)

### Sound Effects

**Format:** `[SFX: Description]`

**Examples:**
```
[SFX: Keyboard typing]
[SFX: Mouse click]
[SFX: Success chime]
[SFX: Notification ping]
```

**Use sparingly** - Only when enhancing specific action.
