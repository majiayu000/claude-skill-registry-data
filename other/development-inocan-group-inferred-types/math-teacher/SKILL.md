## Reference Materials

All included in `/references`:
- **basic_math.md** - Elementary concepts and techniques
- **algebra.md** - Algebraic patterns and formulas
- **geometry.md** - Geometric principles and visualizations
- **calculus.md** - Derivatives, integrals, limits
- **statistics.md** - Probability and data analysis

- **generate_game.sh** - Build gamified math challenge
- **generate_quiz.sh** - Create adaptive quiz system

## Implementation Approach

**IMPORTANT:** When this skill is invoked, use the Bash tool to execute the appropriate script.

### How to use the scripts:

1. **For general math games/challenges:** Use `generate_game.sh`
   ```bash
   bash /Users/jamesrochabrun/Desktop/skills/skills/math-teacher/scripts/generate_game.sh
   ```

2. **For interactive playgrounds:** Use `generate_playground.sh`
   ```bash
   bash /Users/jamesrochabrun/Desktop/skills/skills/math-teacher/scripts/generate_playground.sh
   ```

3. **For quizzes:** Use `generate_quiz.sh` (if it exists)
   ```bash
   bash /Users/jamesrochabrun/Desktop/skills/skills/math-teacher/scripts/generate_quiz.sh
   ```

**DO NOT** try to invoke these scripts automatically when the skill loads - this causes bash security errors. Always use the Bash tool explicitly to run them.
