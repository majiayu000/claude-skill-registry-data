# Plan Validation

## Overview
Turn a plan into a validation matrix and verify it with evidence.

## Workflow
1. Map each plan step to a validation method (test, dry run, sample, or metric).
2. Identify required data, environments, and permissions.
3. Run or propose minimal checks that prove feasibility early.
4. Report confidence with supporting evidence and remaining risks.

## Validation Matrix
- Step
- Validation method
- Success criteria
- Evidence or blockers

## Output Rules
- Provide a realistic confidence percentage with rationale.
- Call out what is untested and what would change the confidence.
- Separate evidence from assumptions and label unknowns explicitly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Validation matrix is present and complete.
- Confidence includes rationale and remaining unknowns.
