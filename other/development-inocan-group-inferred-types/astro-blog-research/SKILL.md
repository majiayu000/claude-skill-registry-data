## SEO & Intent Research

### ⭐ Core SEO (Every Article)
- [ ] **Information Gain analysis** - Article must add unique value beyond existing content. Ask: What do we know that competitors don't? (original data, case studies, insider tips, unique framework)
- [ ] **Intent declared** - Classify as: informational (learning), commercial (comparing options), comparison (this vs that), or transactional (ready to buy)
- [ ] **Headline formula** - Use odd numbers (7, 11, 13) OR power words (proven, secret, complete, ultimate, essential)
- [ ] **Title optimization** - 50-60 chars, keyword-first, include year (2026). Example: "Solar Panel Cost UK 2026: 11 Ways to Save £3,000+"
- [ ] **Entity salience** - Main entity (product/service) in subject position: first 100 words + first sentence after each H2
- [ ] **CTA matches intent** - informational→Newsletter/Guide, commercial→Calculator/Quote, comparison→Consultation, transactional→Contact/Book

### 🎯 SERP Dominance (High-Value Articles)
- [ ] **SERP feature audit** - Google your keyword, note what appears: Featured snippets? PAA boxes? Video carousel? Image pack? Target these formats
- [ ] **Featured snippet targeting** - Identify format: Paragraph (40-60 words), List (5-8 items), or Table (3-4 columns, 5-7 rows)
- [ ] **PAA question identification** - List all "People Also Ask" questions. Use as H2s in your article

### 🎯 Pillar Strategy Decision
- [ ] **Pillar vs cluster** - Pillar = 3000-5000 words, broad topic, 8-12 internal links. Cluster = 1000-1500 words, specific subtopic, 2-4 internal links
- [ ] **Skyscraper candidate?** - If competitive topic with existing content that has 50+ backlinks, plan to create 10x better version + outreach campaign
