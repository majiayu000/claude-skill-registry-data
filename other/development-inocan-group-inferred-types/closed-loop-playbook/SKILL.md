# Closed-Loop Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- After synthesizing VoC insights that require cross-functional action.
- During QBRs or ELT reviews to show status of customer commitments.
- Whenever audit trails are required for compliance or customer councils.

## Framework
1. **Intake** – capture insight ID, driver, severity, customer(s), and evidence link.
2. **Routing** – assign accountable owner, supporting squad, and due date.
3. **Action Plan** – define mitigation plan, success criteria, and measurement method.
4. **Communication** – schedule updates to customers, exec sponsors, and internal stakeholders.
5. **Retrospective** – log outcomes, lessons, and whether additional listening is needed.

## Templates
- Action register (spreadsheet/Notion/Jira) with status automation.
- Customer commitment digest template for AM/CS teams.
- SLA matrix by issue severity and customer tier.

## Tips
- Integrate with ticketing/project systems to avoid duplicate tracking.
- Highlight blockers early; exec sponsors can unblock resources fast.
- Close the loop with customers even when timelines slip—transparency builds trust.
