# Call Highlights Library Skill

## When to Use
- After reviewing calls to showcase great execution or teachable moments.
- Building clip playlists for enablement sessions, cohorts, or leadership updates.
- Creating proof libraries that map to competencies or sales plays.

## Framework
1. **Clip Selection** – pick moments tied to competencies (discovery, objection handling, executive presence).
2. **Tagging** – annotate with metadata (product, industry, persona, stage, motion).
3. **Packaging** – create reels or playlists with context, learning objectives, and prompts.
4. **Distribution** – publish to LMS, Slack, or coaching tools with permissions.
5. **Measurement** – track engagement and incorporate into surveys or certification scoring.

## Templates
- Clip brief (context, timestamp, why it matters, takeaway).
- Playlist outline for programs/cohorts.
- Communication blurb for sharing highlight reels.

## Tips
- Keep clips under two minutes for attention.
- Pair each clip with reflection questions to drive discussion.
- Refresh playlists quarterly to avoid content fatigue.
