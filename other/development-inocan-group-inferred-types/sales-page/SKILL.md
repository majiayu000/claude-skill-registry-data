### 5. Price Presentation Techniques

**Making any price seem reasonable:**

#### Technique 1: Value Anchoring
```
Structure:
- State the "real" value: $X
- Stack additional value: +$Y, +$Z
- Show total value: $TOTAL
- Reveal actual price: $PRICE
- Calculate savings: SAVE $X

Example copy:
"Total value: $2,847
Your investment today: Just $297
You save: $2,550"
```

#### Technique 2: Comparison Anchoring
```
Compare to:
- Cost of the problem continuing
- Alternative solutions (coaching, courses, done-for-you)
- Daily/monthly breakdown
- Coffee/subscription equivalent

Example: "Less than $1/day — that's less than your Netflix subscription"
```

#### Technique 3: ROI Framing
```
Structure:
- If this helps you [achieve X]...
- That's worth $[amount] to your business
- Your investment is only $[price]
- That's a [X]x return

Example: "If this saves you just 2 hours per week at $50/hour, that's $5,200/year. Your investment? $197."
```

#### Technique 4: Payment Options
```
Psychological principles:
- Payment plans feel smaller
- "Just 3 payments of $99" < "$297"
- Add "best value" to full payment
- Use "investment" not "cost" or "price"
```

### 6. Call-to-Action Psychology

**Elements that increase click rates:**

#### Button Copy Formulas
| Type | Formula | Example | Best For |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| Action + Benefit | [Verb] + [What they get] | "Get Instant Access" | Digital products |
| Start + Journey | Start + [Transformation] | "Start My Transformation" | Courses/coaching |
| Yes + Desire | Yes, [I want result] | "Yes, I Want More Leads" | Lead gen |
| Claim + Offer | Claim + [Your offer] | "Claim Your Spot" | Limited offers |

#### Placement Rules
- First CTA: After promise (above fold or just below)
- Second CTA: After major proof section
- Third CTA: After offer reveal
- Final CTA: After guarantee, with urgency

#### Color Psychology
- Orange/Red: Urgency, action
- Green: Safety, money, go
- Blue: Trust, professionalism
- Contrast: Most important factor

#### Micro-Copy That Converts
- Below button: "No credit card required"
- Below button: "Cancel anytime"
