# Geometric Grounding

Use this skill to align semantic meaning with embedding space behavior.

## Workflow

1) Select representative anchors and negatives.
2) Measure distances and cluster behavior.
3) Flag anomalies and adjust embeddings.
4) Report alignment quality.

## Output expectations

- Provide anchor list, metrics, and alignment issues.
