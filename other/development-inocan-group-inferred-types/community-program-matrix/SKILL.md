# Community Program Matrix Skill

## When to Use
- Building quarterly/annual community programming plans.
- Balancing content formats across personas, segments, and lifecycle stages.
- Aligning stakeholders on resource allocation and measurement.

## Framework
1. **Persona vs. Lifecycle Grid** – map each persona to their stage (new, engaged, champion) and needs.
2. **Channel Mix** – forums, live events, office hours, partner co-hosts, UGC, social extensions.
3. **Cadence & Ownership** – define frequency, hosts, moderators, and backup owners.
4. **Value Proposition** – articulate member value + business value for every cell.
5. **Measurement Hooks** – KPIs, instrumentation, and health thresholds per program.

## Templates
- Spreadsheet/Notion template for program grids with filters by persona or channel.
- Slide + one-pager to socialize upcoming programming.
- Resource planning worksheet capturing staffing, budget, and tooling needs.

## Tips
- Highlight "hero moments" each quarter to focus energy and storytelling.
- Rotate community champions into programming slots to showcase voices.
- Pair with `design-community-strategy` and `launch-community-activation-series` for auto-generated calendars.
