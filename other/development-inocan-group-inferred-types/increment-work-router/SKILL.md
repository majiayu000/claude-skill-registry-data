# Increment Work Router - Smart Work Continuation

## Purpose

The increment-work-router skill is an **intelligent work continuation system** that:
- ✅ Detects implementation/continuation intent (not just new projects)
- ✅ Checks for active increments automatically
- ✅ Routes to existing increment OR creates new one
- ✅ Bridges the gap between planning and execution

**Key Insight**: When user says "implement X" or "complete Y", they expect the system to handle routing intelligently without manual commands.

## When to Activate

This skill activates when user expresses **implementation/continuation intent**:

### High-Confidence Triggers (Auto-Route)

**Action Verbs** (with specific target):
- "Implement [feature]"
- "Complete [task]"
- "Build [component]"
- "Add [functionality]"
- "Develop [module]"
- "Create [feature]"

**Continuation Phrases**:
- "Work on [feature]"
- "Continue [increment]"
- "Resume [work]"
- "Finish [task]"
- "Let's implement [X]"
- "Let's build [Y]"
- "Start working on [Z]"

**Bug/Fix Intent**:
- "Fix [issue]"
- "Resolve [bug]"
- "Address [problem]"

### Medium-Confidence Triggers (Clarify)

**Vague Intent** (needs target clarification):
- "Let's continue"
- "Keep working"
- "What's next?"
- "Continue where we left off"

### Don't Activate For

**Planning/Discussion** (let other skills handle):
- "What should we build?" → project-kickstarter
- "How does X work?" → Regular conversation
- "Should we use Y?" → Technical discussion
- "Plan a new feature" → increment-planner

**Already in Workflow**:
- User is already executing `/sw:do`
- Increment planning is in progress
- Another skill is handling the request

## Core Algorithm

### Step 1: Detect Intent

Scan user message for implementation keywords:
```
Action verbs: implement, complete, build, add, develop, create
Continuation: work on, continue, resume, finish, start
Bug/Fix: fix, resolve, address
```

Calculate confidence:
- **High (>80%)**: Action verb + specific target ("implement user auth")
- **Medium (50-80%)**: Action verb only ("let's continue")
- **Low (<50%)**: No clear intent

### Step 2: Check Active Increments

**Read increment state:**
```bash
# Find all increments with status = "active"
find .specweave/increments -name "metadata.json" -type f \
  -exec jq -r 'select(.status == "active") | .id' {} \;
```

**Three scenarios:**
1. **One active increment** → Check relevance and route
2. **Multiple active increments** → Ask user to select
3. **No active increments** → Suggest creating new one

### Step 3: Check Relevance (if active increment exists)

**Relatedness Analysis:**
Compare user's request against active increment:
- Check increment title/description
- Check task list (tasks.md)
- Check spec.md for related features

**Scoring:**
- **High match (>70%)**: Same feature area → Auto-resume
- **Medium match (40-70%)**: Related area → Ask confirmation
- **Low match (<40%)**: Unrelated → Suggest new increment

### Step 4: Route Intelligently

**Scenario A: High relevance to active increment**
```
User: "Implement user authentication"
Active: 0031-user-authentication-system

✅ High match → Auto-resume:

"I see you have an active increment for user authentication (0031).
Resuming work on that increment now with /sw:do..."

[Automatically invokes /sw:do]
```

**Scenario B: Unrelated to active increment**
```
User: "Implement payment processing"
Active: 0031-user-authentication-system

⚠️  Low match → Ask:

"I see you have an active increment (0031-user-authentication-system).

Your request for payment processing seems unrelated. Would you like to:
1. **Create new increment** for payment processing (recommended)
2. **Continue current increment** (0031) and add payment to it
3. **Pause current** and create new increment

What would you prefer?"
```

**Scenario C: No active increment**
```
User: "Implement user authentication"
Active: None

→ Suggest new increment:

"No active increment found. Let's create one for user authentication.

I'm going to create a SpecWeave increment with:
- Specification (WHAT & WHY)
- Technical plan (HOW)
- Task breakdown (STEPS with embedded tests)

Creating increment now with /sw:increment..."

[Automatically invokes /sw:increment "user authentication"]
```

**Scenario D: Multiple active increments**
```
User: "Continue working"
Active: 0031-user-auth, 0032-payment-system

→ Ask to clarify:

"You have 2 active increments:
1. **0031-user-authentication-system** (3/10 tasks complete)
2. **0032-payment-processing** (1/8 tasks complete)

Which one would you like to work on?"
```

**Scenario E: Vague continuation intent**
```
User: "Let's continue"
Active: 0031-user-authentication-system

✅ Auto-resume (only one active):

"Resuming increment 0031-user-authentication-system...
Progress: 3/10 tasks complete (30%)

Next task: T-004 Implement password hashing

[Automatically invokes /sw:do]"
```

## Integration Architecture

**Workflow:**
```
User: "Implement [feature]"
        ↓
increment-work-router (detects intent)
        ↓
[Check .specweave/increments/*/metadata.json]
        ↓
┌───────────────────┬──────────────────┬────────────────┐
│ Active increment  │ Multiple active  │ No active      │
│ (relevant)        │ (ambiguous)      │ (none)         │
└─────┬─────────────┴──────┬───────────┴──────┬─────────┘
      │                    │                  │
      ↓                    ↓                  ↓
/sw:do        Ask to select    /sw:increment
(auto-resume)        (clarify)        (create new)
```

**Calls:**
- `/sw:do` - Resume active increment
- `/sw:increment` - Create new increment
- `/sw:status` - Check increment state (if needed)

**Called By:**
- Automatically when implementation intent detected
- Works alongside `project-kickstarter` (projects) and `increment-planner` (planning)

## Decision Matrix

| User Intent | Active Increments | Relevance | Action |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------|
| "Implement auth" | 1 (auth-related) | High (>70%) | Auto `/sw:do` |
| "Implement auth" | 1 (unrelated) | Low (<40%) | Ask: New or add to current? |
| "Implement auth" | 0 | N/A | Auto `/sw:increment` |
| "Implement auth" | 2+ | N/A | Ask which increment |
| "Let's continue" | 1 | N/A | Auto `/sw:do` |
| "Let's continue" | 2+ | N/A | Ask which increment |
| "Let's continue" | 0 | N/A | "No active increment. What should we build?" |

## Relevance Matching Logic

**How to determine if request relates to active increment:**

```typescript
function calculateRelevance(userRequest: string, increment: Increment): number {
  let score = 0;

  // 1. Title/ID match (strongest signal)
  if (increment.title.toLowerCase().includes(extractKeywords(userRequest))) {
    score += 40;
  }

  // 2. Tasks match (check tasks.md)
  const tasks = readTasksFile(increment);
  const matchingTasks = tasks.filter(t =>
    t.title.toLowerCase().includes(extractKeywords(userRequest))
  );
  score += (matchingTasks.length / tasks.length) * 30;

  // 3. Spec match (check spec.md user stories)
  const spec = readSpecFile(increment);
  if (spec.includes(extractKeywords(userRequest))) {
    score += 20;
  }

  // 4. Type match (feature vs bug vs hotfix)
  const requestType = detectType(userRequest);
  if (requestType === increment.type) {
    score += 10;
  }

  return score; // 0-100
}
```

**Example:**
```
User: "Implement JWT token refresh"
Active: 0031-user-authentication-system

Checks:
✅ Title contains "authentication" (user mentions "JWT token") → +40 points
✅ Tasks.md has "T-005: Implement JWT refresh logic" → +30 points
✅ Spec.md mentions "token management" → +20 points
✅ Both are "feature" type → +10 points

Total: 100/100 → High relevance → Auto-resume
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Auto-Resume (High Relevance)

**Context:**
```
Active: 0031-user-authentication-system
Progress: 3/10 tasks complete
```

**User:**
```
Implement JWT token refresh
```

**increment-work-router:**
```
✅ Intent detected: "implement" + specific target
✅ Active increment found: 0031-user-authentication-system
✅ Relevance check: 95% match (authentication-related)

→ AUTO-RESUME

"I see you have an active increment for user authentication (0031).
Task T-005 'Implement JWT token refresh' is already in your plan.

Resuming increment 0031 now with /sw:do...

[Automatically invokes /sw:do]
```

### Example 2: Create New (No Active Increment)

**Context:**
```
Active: None
```

**User:**
```
Implement payment processing with Stripe
```

**increment-work-router:**
```
✅ Intent detected: "implement" + specific target
❌ No active increment found

→ CREATE NEW

"No active increment found. Let's create one for payment processing.

I'm going to create a SpecWeave increment with:
- Specification (Stripe integration requirements)
- Technical plan (API integration, webhooks, security)
- Task breakdown (implementation steps with tests)

Creating increment now with /sw:increment...

[Automatically invokes /sw:increment "payment processing with Stripe"]
```

### Example 3: Unrelated Request (Ask)

**Context:**
```
Active: 0031-user-authentication-system
Progress: 3/10 tasks complete
```

**User:**
```
Implement email notifications
```

**increment-work-router:**
```
✅ Intent detected: "implement" + specific target
✅ Active increment found: 0031-user-authentication-system
⚠️  Relevance check: 15% match (unrelated)

→ ASK FOR CLARIFICATION

"I see you have an active increment (0031-user-authentication-system) with 3/10 tasks complete.

Your request for email notifications seems unrelated. Would you like to:
1. **Create new increment** for email notifications (recommended - keeps work focused)
2. **Add to current increment** (0031) - if notifications are for auth emails
3. **Pause current increment** and start notifications

SpecWeave works best with focused increments. What would you prefer?"
```

### Example 4: Multiple Active (Clarify)

**Context:**
```
Active: 0031-user-authentication-system (3/10 tasks)
Active: 0032-payment-processing (1/8 tasks)
```

**User:**
```
Let's continue working
```

**increment-work-router:**
```
✅ Intent detected: "continue" (vague)
✅ Multiple active increments found: 2

→ ASK TO SELECT

"You have 2 active increments:

1. **0031-user-authentication-system**
   - Progress: 3/10 tasks (30%)
   - Next: T-004 Implement password hashing

2. **0032-payment-processing**
   - Progress: 1/8 tasks (12%)
   - Next: T-002 Set up Stripe SDK

Which one would you like to work on?"

[Wait for user selection, then invoke /sw:do {selected-id}]
```

### Example 5: Vague Intent + Single Active (Auto-Resume)

**Context:**
```
Active: 0031-user-authentication-system (3/10 tasks)
```

**User:**
```
What's next?
```

**increment-work-router:**
```
✅ Intent detected: "what's next" (continuation)
✅ One active increment: 0031-user-authentication-system

→ AUTO-RESUME

"Resuming increment 0031-user-authentication-system...
Progress: 3/10 tasks complete (30%)

Next task: **T-004 Implement password hashing**

[Automatically invokes /sw:do]"
```

## Opt-Out Mechanism

Users can override auto-routing with explicit instructions:
- "Don't resume, create new" → Forces new increment
- "Just discuss first" → Regular conversation
- "Plan without implementing" → Routes to `/sw:increment` only
- "Show me the current state" → Uses `/sw:status` instead

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Users can say "implement X" and work starts automatically
- ✅ Smart routing to active increments (no manual `/sw:do`)
- ✅ Detects unrelated requests and prevents scope creep
- ✅ No "which increment?" confusion (auto-handles single active)
- ✅ Clear choices when ambiguous (multiple active or unrelated)
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing skills (project-kickstarter, increment-planner)

## Related Skills

- **project-kickstarter**: For NEW project descriptions (complements, doesn't overlap)
- **increment-planner**: For creating increment structure (invoked by this skill)
- **detector**: For checking SpecWeave context

---

**Key Distinction:**
- `project-kickstarter` = "I want to BUILD a new product" (project-level)
- `increment-work-router` = "IMPLEMENT this feature/task" (execution-level)
- `increment-planner` = "PLAN this increment" (planning-level)

This skill bridges planning → execution by auto-detecting implementation intent.
