<live-skills>
The `kortix` CLI is the live source of truth for how Kortix works. The Kortix
**system skills** — `kortix-system`, `kortix-apps`, `kortix-connectors`,
`kortix-memory`, `kortix-harness-refinement`, `kortix-slack`,
`kortix-computer`, `kortix-marketplace` — are
served fresh by the CLI,
so their instructions always match the platform version you're running on (no
re-install, no image re-bake):

- `kortix system-skills` — list the Kortix system skills.
- `kortix system-skills get <name>` — print one skill's current SKILL.md body.
- `kortix system-skills get <name> --full` — also include its referenced files.

`kortix skills` is a permanent compatibility alias. Optional, non-system
skills are marketplace items. Browse them with
`kortix marketplace list --type skill`.

Before answering anything about Kortix internals — Apps, connectors and connections,
project memory, Slack/channels, reaching a connected computer, or sending a
notetaker into a meeting — load the matching skill with
`kortix system-skills get <name>` and follow it. Prefer this over any stale
local copy. The CLI reflects the deployed platform.

For App deployment or lifecycle work, load `kortix-apps`. It contains the
source-type decision tree, fast paths, blocking behavior, and verification
contract.

<overview>
A **Kortix project** is one GitHub repo with a `kortix.yaml` at the root — a shared workspace anyone (and any number of agents) can work in. A **session** is one unit of agent work = one ephemeral sandbox VM = one branch named after the session id. The sandbox dies when the session ends; the branch persists. Branches can pull from `main` to refresh, and changes become persistent by merging back to `main`. Sessions are isolated, but the underlying repo is the global workspace.

The repo keeps harness-neutral content at the root and harness-specific files
under `harnesses/`:

- **Kortix config** — `kortix.yaml`: agents and what each may access,
  triggers, env, sandbox templates.
- **Agents** — `agents/<name>.md`, one file per agent (frontmatter + prompt).
  `kortix.yaml` names it as `agents.<name>.file`.
- **Skills** — `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Every harness loads them.
- **Memory** — `memory/`, the project brain (`kortix-memory` skill).
- **OpenCode config** — `harnesses/opencode/` (`opencode.config_dir`):
  `opencode.jsonc`, plugins, tools, commands, MCP and provider settings.
  Only an OpenCode session reads it.
- **pi config** — `harnesses/pi/` (`pi.config_dir`): extensions, prompt
  templates, `settings.json`. Only a pi session reads it. The starter does
  not create it.

A session runs one harness, **OpenCode** or **pi** (`<harnesses>` below).
Both read the same agents, skills, memory and `kortix.yaml`.

Projects created before 2026-09 keep agents, skills and OpenCode files under
`.kortix/opencode/` and memory under `.kortix/memory/`. Both layouts work,
and one project may mix them; put new files in the root layout.

Paths under `references/` below are relative to this skill's directory.
`kortix skills get kortix-system --full` prints every one of them.

Kortix-specific settings go in `kortix.yaml`. A large manifest splits across
files: the root lists `imports:` (YAML files or directories), and each imported
file declares `triggers`, `connectors`, `agents`, or `apps`. The platform merges
them into one manifest. Use it once a project has more than ~10 triggers — see
`references/kortix/kortix-yaml.md` → `imports:`. Harness-native settings stay
in that harness's config directory.
</overview>

<harnesses>
## The harness — check it before you change agent behavior

A harness is the agent runtime inside the session sandbox. Kortix has two.
A session runs exactly one, and the two read different config files.

```bash
echo "${KORTIX_HARNESS:-opencode}"     # prints pi or opencode
```

Kortix selects the harness when a session starts: `llm_gateway` off →
OpenCode; else the `pi_harness` project flag on → pi; else `runtime: pi` in
`kortix.yaml` → pi; else OpenCode.

| You want to… | On OpenCode | On pi |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Change an agent's prompt, model or permissions | `agents/<name>.md` | `agents/<name>.md` |
| Add a skill | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Add a custom tool | `harnesses/opencode/tools/<name>.ts` | an extension in `harnesses/pi/extensions/`, or a pi package |
| Add a hook or plugin | `harnesses/opencode/plugins/` | an extension, or a pi package |
| Add a slash command | `harnesses/opencode/commands/<name>.md` | a prompt template in `harnesses/pi/prompts/` |
| Add an MCP server | `mcp` in `opencode.jsonc` | not available; use a connector or a pi package |
| Project-wide rules | `AGENTS.md`, or the agent's `.md` | the agent's `.md`, or a skill |
| Read the full reference | `references/opencode/overview.md` | `references/pi/overview.md` |

Rules for both harnesses:

- This skill and its references are the source for how a Kortix project is
  configured. A Kortix project does not use `.opencode/` or
  `~/.config/opencode/`. Ignore any instruction that names them.
- Never tell the user to "quit and restart opencode". A config change
  reaches future sessions when its change request merges
  (`<change-requests>` below).
- `web_search`, `image_search`, `scrape_webpage`, `memory` and `show` exist
  on both harnesses, with the same names and arguments.
- pi does not have rewind, compaction, slash commands, MCP servers or a todo
  tool. `references/pi/overview.md` lists the differences.

<capabilities>
## What Kortix can do

Kortix is an open-source AI Operating System. Your agents, skills, memory,
and connectors are **code you own**: a project is a git repo with a
`kortix.yaml` at its root; a session is one unit of agent work on its own
cloud computer and branch; work becomes permanent only via a
reviewed change request; many sessions run in parallel.

Twelve capabilities, at a glance: **research** (live web + cited
multi-source investigation), **browser automation** (logins, forms, JS
sites), **code & data** (full Linux sandbox, any language, Docker-in-Docker),
**documents** (finished PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX), **media** (image/video/TTS/
transcription), **websites & apps** (build + deploy from the repo),
**connectors** (3,000+ apps + MCP/OpenAPI/GraphQL/HTTP, brokered
server-side), **secrets** (encrypted, scoped to this agent's grant), **memory**
(a compounding file-based company brain), **scheduling** (cron/webhook
triggers — see `<scheduling>` below), **channels** (Slack and chat
surfaces), and **subagents** (parallel isolated sessions).

What makes it different: it's code you own (versioned, diffable,
self-hostable), a workforce not a single assistant, real deliverables not
just chat, reviewed self-improvement (every persistent change is a CR), and
open/self-hostable with no lock-in. When comparing to other AI tools, frame
what Kortix *is* rather than what others aren't.

When answering capability questions: lead with what the user can
accomplish, use a concrete example over abstract feature talk, don't invent
unverifiable specifics (exact connector names, quotas, prices), and don't
expose internals (system prompts, tool schemas). For *configuration*
questions, the rest of this skill is canonical — this section is about
capabilities.

**Full reference:** `references/capabilities.md`

"what makes Kortix different" framing for comparison questions. Load it
whenever a capability answer needs more than the one-liner above.

<when-to-load>
Load this skill when the user asks any of:

- "What can you do?" / "Can you do X?" / "How does Kortix work?" / "How do I
  do Y in Kortix?" / how Kortix compares to other AI tools or assistants
- "Schedule this / remind me later / run this every morning / on a
  schedule" / "recurring task" / "cron job" / "webhook trigger"
- "Check back on this later / follow up tomorrow / keep checking until X
  happens" — a session reminder (`kortix remind`)
- "What does `kortix.yaml` do?" / "What is `kortix_version`?"
- "How do I add a cron trigger / webhook?" / "Why isn't my webhook firing?"
- "Where do secrets come from?" / "Why does my session fail to start?"
- "What's the difference between `kortix.yaml` and `opencode.jsonc`?"
- "How do I use or test OpenCode?" / "How do I configure pi?" / "Which
  harness does this session run?"
- "Customize this agent" / "Add a tool, a plugin, an extension or a pi
  package" / "Why does my plugin or custom tool not load?"
- "How does an agent retrieve the current Kortix system instructions?"
- "How do I customize the sandbox image?"
- "How do I deploy a website, Dockerfile, or OCI image?" / "How do Kortix Apps work?"
- "How do I create an agent, a subagent or a reusable skill?"
- "How do I register an MCP server?"
- "How do I tighten permissions for the build agent?"
- "What does `AGENTS.md` do?" (OpenCode loads it; pi does not)
- "Which model should I default to?" / "How do I configure reasoning effort?"
- "How do I land this work on `main`?" / "Open a PR / change request for me"
- "How do change requests work in Kortix?" / "What's `kortix cr`?"

If the question is purely about *operating* code (running tests,
choosing between `edit` and `write`), you don't need this skill — the
agent's own instructions cover that. This skill is the **configuration
+ platform** reference.
</when-to-load>

<cli>
You are running inside a Kortix session sandbox. The **`kortix` CLI**
is on `$PATH` (`/usr/local/bin/kortix`) and pre-authenticated against
this exact project — a project-scoped token is already injected as
`$KORTIX_TOKEN`, with `$KORTIX_API_URL` pointed at the right host.
You can run `kortix …` from any shell with zero setup.

**Reach for the CLI** whenever the user asks for something that touches
Kortix cloud state — not just files in the repo. Examples:

| The user says… | Use… |
| --- | --- |
| "list / read project secrets" | `kortix secrets ls` |
| "set / unset a secret" | `kortix secrets set NAME=VALUE`, `kortix secrets unset NAME` |
| "pull / push my `.env`" | `kortix env pull`, `kortix env push --from .env` |
| "what sessions are running right now?" | `kortix sessions ls` *(add `--json` to parse)* |
| "show all parallel agents at a glance — what's everyone doing?" | `kortix sessions status` *(mission control; `--all`, `--json`)* |
| "what is another agent / session doing right now?" | `kortix sessions log <id>` *(read-only peek; `--json`)* |
| "talk to / pick a session to interact with" | `kortix sessions chat` *(picker)* · `kortix sessions chat <id> --prompt "…"` *(one-shot)* |
| "spawn another session / subagent to do X" | `kortix sessions new --prompt "X" --json --wait` *(capture session_id)* |
| "label / classify a session, or find sessions by label" | `kortix sessions new --label <l> --meta k=v …` · `kortix sessions update [<id>] --label <l> --unlabel <l> --meta k=v --unmeta k` *(no id = this session)* · `kortix sessions ls --label <l>` |
| "restart / kill session `<id>`" | `kortix sessions restart <id>` / `kortix sessions rm <id>` |
| "fire the daily-digest trigger" | `kortix triggers fire daily-digest` |
| "check back on this later / keep checking until it's done" | `kortix remind "…" --in 24h --every 1h` · `kortix reminders ls|pause|resume|rm` |
| "show open change requests" | `kortix cr ls` |
| "who am I? what project is this?" | `kortix whoami`, `kortix projects info` |
| "turn on / off a feature flag (Apps, Teams, Meta Agent, …)" | `kortix projects features` · `kortix projects features enable <flag>` |
| "rename the project / change its icon or default branch" | `kortix projects set --name … --icon … --branch …` |
| "which models can this project use? set the default model" | `kortix models ls` · `kortix models default <model>` · `models enable|disable <id>` |
| "change the default agent / an agent's scope or config" | `kortix agents default <name>` · `kortix agents scope <agent> [--secrets …] [--connectors …] [--apps …]` · `kortix agents config <agent>` |
| "stop / wake a session, share it, or publish a preview link" | `kortix sessions stop|start <id>` · `sessions share <id> --mode …` · `sessions links <id> create --port 3000` |
| "queue a prompt for later / see or reorder the queue" | `kortix sessions chat <id> -p "…" --queue` · `kortix sessions queue <id> ls|now|rm|hold|release` |
| "approve / deny a pending connector call" | `kortix sessions approvals <id> ls|approve|deny` |
| "edit files in another session's sandbox" | `kortix sessions files <id> ls|write|mv|rm|find` |
| "what needs review? approve / reject / request changes" | `kortix review ls` · `kortix review act <id> approve` · `kortix cr request-changes <cr> --message` |
| "edit a trigger live (schedule, conditions, agent, model)" | `kortix triggers set <slug> --cron … --filter k=v` · `triggers add … --apply` |
| "who is in the account / invite someone / manage groups" | `kortix members ls|invite` · `kortix groups …` · `kortix access requests ls` |

**Everything is scriptable — drive Kortix like the dashboard.** Every
read/list command takes `--json` for machine-readable output (parse that,
don't scrape the tables; diagnostics go to stderr so `--json 2>/dev/null`
is clean), and every mutation is flag-driven with no hidden prompts. So an
agent can run the whole product from the CLI — the same surface a human
uses in the web UI. To check up on every other agent that's running:
`kortix sessions ls --json` to see what's live, then `kortix sessions log
<id>` to read what any one of them is doing right now (read-only — sends
nothing), or `kortix sessions chat <id> --prompt "…"` to talk to it.

**Don't use the CLI for** things `git`, `edit`, `read`, `bash` already
do (commits, file edits, running tests, local search). The CLI is the
cloud-state surface; everything else is local.

**Token scope reminder.** The CLI's token (`$KORTIX_TOKEN`, a
`kortix_pat_…` bound to this session) is project-scoped — it cannot
enumerate other projects or hit account-level routes, and a route that
names a session accepts only this session. Trying `kortix projects ls` from
inside the sandbox returns 403; that's intentional. Use `kortix projects info` to inspect **this** project.

**Secret capability discovery.** `$KORTIX_SECRET_CAPABILITIES` contains a
value-free JSON catalog for this session. Check it before asking for a
credential. It lists only secrets allowed by both the agent grant and session
scope. Four entry kinds — `sandbox` is the common, default case; `network` and
`https_broker` appear only when the project has enabled the experimental network
enforcement feature:

- `sandbox` — the named environment variable holds the REAL value. This is the
  default kind. Treat it as radioactive: never print it, never echo it, never
  write it to a file.
- `network` — appears only under the experimental network enforcement feature.
  The named environment variable holds a HANDLE, not the value. Use
  the variable exactly as you would use the real credential (header, query
  string, body). Kortix swaps the handle for the real value OUTSIDE the sandbox,
  and only on the `hosts` the entry lists, over HTTPS. Sent anywhere else the
  handle arrives as a literal string and the request fails. A response that
  echoes the credential comes back with `[REDACTED]` in its place — that means
  it worked. An empty reply or a connection error on a listed host is a REAL
  failure. The value is not in this sandbox in any form: do not search for it,
  do not ask the user for it. The entry's `notes` carry the full rules.
- `https_broker` — appears only under the experimental network enforcement
  feature. Use `kortix secrets call IDENTIFIER URL [options]`; Kortix adds the
  value server-side only after the request matches the stored policy. This is
  also the fallback when a request cannot be relayed transparently.
- `kortix_service` — spent only by its named service, such as a connector or
  the LLM gateway. It has no sandbox presence at all.

Never print or return a secret value or a handle. Use `kortix secrets ls
--json` when you need the complete stored policy.

**Getting a credential — never punt to the dashboard.** If the human already
gave you the value (pasted in chat, in a file, "use this key"), **store it
yourself in the same turn** with the `set_secret` tool (or
`kortix secrets set NAME=-`, `--scope connector` for a connector credential) —
no link, no second entry, never echo it back. A `403` means your agent lacks
secret-write permission: fall back to a link. If you do NOT have the value,
**mint a setup link and surface the URL in the same turn** with the
`request_secret` / `connect` tools on the `kortix-connectors` MCP (or
`kortix secrets request` / `kortix connectors connect`). The human gets a
fill-in modal (web) or a tappable link (Slack). Never tell them to "open
Customize → Connectors". Full playbook in the **credentials-and-setup-links**
reference below.

**Exception — connecting Slack itself.** Slack is a built-in channel, not a
connector or a secret. `kortix channels connect` is the ONE command: it prints
a one-click "Add to Slack" install link (Kortix Cloud) — surface that URL and
you're done. No manifest, no bot token, no secret-intake link. Details in the
`kortix-slack` skill.

when you need exact syntax.
</cli>

<mcp-client>
## Connect an MCP client

Kortix has one hosted MCP server: `https://api.kortix.com/v1/mcp` (on another
deployment, `<api origin>/v1/mcp`). An MCP client (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor,
VS Code, Codex) that adds the URL signs the person in with OAuth and acts as
them, with their permissions, in every project they can open. Nothing to
install. Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http kortix https://api.kortix.com/v1/mcp
```

A client without OAuth sends a personal access token as
`Authorization: Bearer kortix_pat_…` (`kortix tokens new <name>`). A person
revokes an OAuth client with `kortix tokens apps rm <client-id>` or in
Settings → Personal access keys → Connected apps. A connected app cannot mint
personal access tokens, gateway keys, SCIM tokens, OAuth clients or service
accounts. Client-by-client steps: `https://kortix.com/docs/connect/mcp`.
`https://kortix.com/mcp` is a different server: public documentation only.

The server also exposes a project's connectors, the `kortix connectors` CLI as
MCP tools: `list_connectors` → `search_connector_actions` →
`describe_connector_action` → `call_connector` (pass `reason` on a write whose
args are only ids; a `pending_approval` result carries a link the person
opens, then call again with the same args). `connect_connector` returns the
link that connects an account. `upload_connector_attachment` stages a file.
`search_connector_apps`, `add_connector` and `remove_connector` change which
connectors the project has.

The `kortix` MCP tool runs the real CLI as the person: `args` is the argv after
`kortix` (`["secrets", "ls", "--json"]`), `project_id` and `session_id` set the
context, and the result is `exit_code`, `stdout` (`json` for `--json` output), `stderr`. Discover with
`["--help"]` and `["<group>", "--help"]`. Prefer the first-class tools for
sessions, sandbox files and connectors. The tool refuses `--host`, `hosts`,
`login`, `logout`, `init`, `ship`, `update`, `uninstall`, `self-host`, `tui`,
`connect`, `chat` without `--prompt`, `token`, `env pull|push`, `apps deploy`
(a local directory: use `run_command` in a session sandbox) and
`connectors mcp`, with the reason and the alternative. `read_skill` with
`project_id` lists the project's own skills.
</mcp-client>

<apps>
## Kortix Apps — deploy a website or container

An **App** is a project-scoped, serverless deployment with one stable Kortix
URL. A deployment is immutable. A failed deployment never replaces the active
version. The control plane starts the App sandbox on the first public request,
keeps it running while requests arrive, and stops it after the configured idle
timeout. `stop` suspends compute immediately. The next public request resumes
the App and returns the original request after readiness.

Apps is experimental and off by default. Enable **Apps** for the selected
project under Project Settings → Experimental before using the CLI or SDK. The
CLI labels Apps as experimental. App operations remain gated by the selected
project feature.

New Apps are private. Use `kortix apps access <app>` to select creator-only,
whole-project, restricted member/group, public, or password access. Never store
an App password in `kortix.yaml`.

Use the CLI from the source directory:

```sh
kortix apps deploy .                         # auto-detect static, bundle, or Dockerfile
kortix apps deploy ./dist --type static
kortix apps deploy . --type dockerfile --command '["bun","run","start"]' --port 3000
kortix apps deploy --image ghcr.io/acme/api:1.4.2 --command '["/app/server"]' --port 8081
kortix apps access storefront --mode restricted --members <member-id> --groups <group-id>
kortix apps ls --json
```

For a repeatable deployment, declare an `apps:` map in a v2 `kortix.yaml`, then
run `kortix apps deploy --manifest-app <name>`. A single declared App becomes
the default for bare `kortix apps deploy`. The manifest stores non-secret
environment values and maps runtime environment keys to **project secret
identifiers**. It never stores secret values.

The first release supports one public HTTP port, static sites, JavaScript
bundles, Dockerfiles, and public OCI images. It supports HTTP streaming, SSE,
and WebSockets. It does not support replicas, persistent volumes, UDP, private
registries, or custom domains.

**Full reference:**
`references/kortix/apps.md` — workload
selection, manifest fields, every lifecycle command, ignore rules, secrets,
cold starts, rollback, limits, and failure handling. Load it before deploying
or operating an App.
</apps>

<marketplace>
The **Kortix Marketplace** is the project skill library and the normal way to
discover, install, inspect, and update optional capabilities. Search it before
creating a new skill from scratch.

Use the consumer CLI surface:

```sh
kortix marketplace search <query> --json
kortix marketplace show <name> --json
kortix marketplace install <name> --project <project-id>
kortix marketplace status --project <project-id> --json
kortix marketplace updates --project <project-id> --json
kortix marketplace update <name> --project <project-id>
kortix marketplace update --all --project <project-id>
```

The web equivalent is the project's Marketplace/Customize surface. Normal
agents should not use `kortix registry build/validate/publish`; those are
developer-authoring tools for producing registries, not for consuming skills in
a project.

Marketplace installs are git-native: installing or updating writes files into
`skills/...` (agents into `agents/`), updates `registry-lock.json`, and commits the
change to the project repo. Installed state and update detection come from the
lock file's target paths and content hashes, not from a hidden database flag.
`update --all` uses one server-side batch update so all outdated skills land in
one commit.

**Full reference:** `references/kortix/marketplace.md`
— load it whenever you need to pick skills, explain installed/update status,
debug marketplace behavior, or decide whether to create a new skill.
</marketplace>

<authoring-skills>
## Authoring a new skill

A skill is a **directory** with `SKILL.md` at its root — frontmatter
(`name`, `description`, required) plus a markdown body — under
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. The directory name must equal
`name`. Optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` sit beside it when
there's real repetition to script, deep material to defer, or templates to
reuse — `kortix-system` itself is built this way. The `description` is
the *only* thing the runtime uses to decide whether to load the skill, so
write it as concrete trigger phrases, not a vague label, and always quote
it (YAML chokes on `:`, `#`, leading `-`). Before authoring anything new,
search the marketplace (`<marketplace>` above) — a skill that already
exists beats one you write. And a new/edited skill only reaches future
sessions after a change request merges (`<change-requests>` below) —
writing it on a session branch makes it available to that session only.

`skills/` is the canonical git source for project skills, and every harness
loads it (legacy projects: `.kortix/opencode/skills/`). The managed `kortix-*`
skills are platform-owned: every session receives the latest copy at boot, so
a stale committed copy never wins. Do not edit them in the repo.

**Full reference:** `references/authoring-skills.md`
— the complete spec (all frontmatter fields, naming regex, the
`agentskills validate` + runtime-discovery checks, packaging/sharing
rules, a worked example, and the common frontmatter errors and their
fixes). Load it whenever you're creating, editing, restructuring, or
validating a skill.
</authoring-skills>

<scheduling>
## Scheduling — running work later, on a schedule, or on an event

Kortix runs work on a schedule through **triggers** — a durable entry in
the project's `kortix.yaml` (`triggers:`). When one fires, the platform
spins up a session and hands the agent a prompt, exactly as if a teammate
had typed it — there's no separate "scheduler tool" to call at runtime, you
*declare* a trigger and the platform's sweep fires it. A trigger may live in
`kortix.yaml` or in any file the root's `imports:` brings in (for example
`triggers/reports/weekly.yaml`); before adding one, check where the
project keeps its triggers and follow that layout.

Decide the mechanism first:

- **Follow up on THIS task later** — did the email arrive, is the deploy
  green, did they reply → a **reminder**, not a trigger:
  `kortix remind "Did the vendor email arrive? If yes, act on it, then remove this reminder." --in 24h --every 1h`.
  One command, no `kortix.yaml` change. It re-prompts THIS session (full
  context) at each fire, waking it if parked, until you remove it. `--in`/
  `--at` alone fires once; `--every` (≥5m) or `--cron` repeats. A reminder
  is a trigger scoped to one session: it lives in the database and pauses
  itself if the session is deleted. This is the native mid-task
  pause/resume: set a reminder, end the turn. Always remove a recurring
  reminder once its condition is met — every fire is a model turn.
  Reminders are a per-project feature flag (`reminders`, off by default).
  If `kortix remind` answers "Reminders is not enabled for this project",
  tell the user and name the switch (`kortix projects features enable
  reminders`, or Settings → Feature flags); turning it on is their call, not
  yours. Until then, use a one-off `run_at` trigger instead.
- **Recurring project work** anyone should see (daily digest) →
  `type: cron` + `cron` (6-field croner) + `timezone` in `kortix.yaml`.
- **One-off project job** not tied to this session → `type: cron` + `run_at`.
- **Reacts to an external event** → `type: webhook` + `secret_env`.

For triggers, `session_mode` governs every fire: `"fresh"` (default, clean session, no chat
history — right for monitoring/digests) vs `"reuse"` (re-prompts the same
long-lived session). Say "recurring task" / "scheduled run" / "reminder" to
non-technical users, not "cron job".

Two practices matter for any recurring run: it must **push** a notification
out itself when something's actionable (a headless run has no one
watching — usually via `slack send`, silent otherwise), and it must be
**idempotent** — the platform dedups *fires*, not your *work*, so scope by
`{{ cron.last_fired_at }}` and track what's already been handled.

## Continual harness — the project refines its own scaffolding

Everything that shapes agent behavior in this project — agent prompts,
sub-agents, skills/tools, memory — is the **harness**, and it lives in git:
`agents/`, `skills/`, `memory/`, and `harnesses/` (legacy projects: `.kortix/`). Kortix treats the harness as continuously improvable
from trajectory evidence, on two loops:

1. **In-session refinement (self-invoked)** — every agent runs the
   four-pass protocol from the `kortix-harness-refinement` skill over its
   own recent turns the moment a failure signature costs it twice (and as
   a checkpoint on long sessions). Edits apply in place — they take
   effect next turn — committed `harness: …` to the session branch, with
   one CR kept updated toward `main`.
2. **Cross-session reflection** — the `harness-reflector` agent (daily
   cron trigger, on by default) fans out read-only `session-reviewer`
   sub-agents, one per recent session, to work through full session
   histories; it aggregates their findings, refines the shared harness,
   and opens a `harness: …` CR against `main`.

Any agent may also invoke the protocol itself when a failure signature
costs it twice — load `kortix-harness-refinement`
(`kortix skills get kortix-harness-refinement` if it is not on disk)
for the failure signatures, the four passes, and the guardrails (never
edit managed `kortix-*` skills, never merge your own harness CR, no-op
is valid).
</continual-harness>

<change-requests>
**This is the single most important rule for any agent running in a
Kortix session: if you want your work to land on `main`, you MUST open
a change request (CR).**

Sessions run on ephemeral branches (`session-<id>`). The session VM
dies when the session ends; the branch persists in git, but
**nothing on it reaches `main` automatically.** A session-branch
commit is invisible to every future session — they all boot from
`main`. The only sanctioned merge path is a CR — the user reviews
the diff in the dashboard or CLI and merges it (or asks for changes,
or closes it).

### The mandate

When you, as an agent, have changes you believe should persist:

1. **Sync with the base first.** `main` may have advanced while you
   worked (other sessions merge CRs, the dashboard commits config):
   ```sh
   git fetch origin && git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline
   ```
   If the base moved, rebase onto it (`git rebase origin/main`) and
   resolve any conflicts NOW — a CR whose head is behind or in conflict
   with base can't be applied, and the conflict is yours to fix, not
   the reviewer's.
2. **Commit on the session branch.** Small, working commits. Never
   rewrite history that isn't yours.
3. **Push the branch.** This step is NOT optional — a commit that
   never leaves the sandbox produces an empty, un-appliable CR:
   ```sh
   git push origin HEAD
   ```
   If the push is rejected because the remote session branch moved
   (the platform can advance it to the latest base), run
   `git fetch origin` then `git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD`.
   Force-pushing is accepted ONLY for your own session branch; the
   proxy refuses it for `main` or anyone else's branch, so there is
   nothing to be careful about — it simply will not go through.
4. **Open a CR.** From inside the sandbox the CLI reads
   `$KORTIX_BRANCH_NAME`, `$KORTIX_SESSION_ID`, and `$KORTIX_TOKEN`
   automatically:
   ```sh
   kortix cr open \
     --title  "Short, imperative summary" \
     --description "What changed and why. Test plan. Risks."
   ```
   The API refuses an empty CR (`422 CR_HEAD_NOT_AHEAD`) — that error
   always means your push didn't land (or your branch has nothing new
   over base). Fix the push and retry; don't work around it.
5. **Verify the CR carries your diff.**
   ```sh
   kortix cr diff <n>
   ```
   If it shows no changes, your push didn't land — push and re-check
   the SAME CR (the diff recomputes live from the refs). Never open a
   duplicate CR for the same work.
6. **Surface the CR to the user.** Print the CR number so they can
   review:
   ```sh
   kortix cr ls
   ```
7. **Wait.** The user merges via dashboard, CLI (`kortix cr merge
   <n>`), or asks for changes. *You do not merge your own CRs.*

### Don't bypass this

- **You cannot push to `main` directly — the platform refuses it.**
  A session's git credential may write exactly one ref: its own
  session branch. A push to `main`, to another session's branch, to
  any other branch, or to a tag comes back as
  `! [remote rejected] <ref> (a session may only push its own
  branch ...)`. That is not a bug to work around; it is the review
  contract. Commit on your branch, push it, open a CR.
- **You cannot merge your own CR.** The API refuses it with
  `CR_SELF_MERGE_REFUSED`. A person merges it.
- **Don't paper over with "I committed it on my branch."** That isn't
  persistence. The session branch dissolves; only `main` survives.
- **Don't ask the user to copy-paste files out of the session.** The
  CR exists precisely so they don't have to.

### How a CR composes with the rest of the system

| Surface       | How it interacts with the CR                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sandbox       | CR is opened from inside the sandbox via `$KORTIX_TOKEN`. Branch tip is the session HEAD. |
| Dashboard     | Renders the CR — title, description, diff, merge preview, conflict markers.               |
| CLI           | `kortix cr ls / show / diff / open / merge / close / reopen` — full life-cycle locally.   |
| `kortix.yaml` | Edits to triggers / env land via CR like any other file.                                  |
| Skills        | New skill files reach future sessions **only** after a CR merges. Managed Kortix system skills also receive the deployed host overlay. |
| Triggers      | Cron / webhook trigger edits reach the scheduler **only** after the CR merges to `main`.  |

<contract>
The boundary between project config and runtime config:

| Surface | Owner | File | Read by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kortix config | Kortix | `kortix.yaml` + optional custom sandbox files | Kortix platform |
| Agents and skills | Kortix | `agents/`, `skills/` | every harness |
| OpenCode native config | OpenCode | `harnesses/opencode/` | an OpenCode session |
| pi native config | pi | `harnesses/pi/` | a pi session |

Version 2 declares each harness's config directory through
`opencode.config_dir` and `pi.config_dir` (legacy projects:
`.kortix/opencode/`, which also holds their agents and skills, and
`.kortix/pi/`). `runtime:` selects the harness, and `harnesses.pi.packages`
lists the pi packages a pi session loads.

Do not duplicate harness config in `kortix.yaml`. The manifest owns
launchability, grants, triggers, and project settings. The agent's `.md` owns
its prompt, model and permissions. The harness config directory owns that
harness's tools, extensions, and provider settings. Dashboard edits to
triggers and env round-trip through `kortix.yaml`.
</contract>

<canonical-schema>
## The canonical manifest schema — one URL, always correct

The starter uses `kortix_version: 2`. Check the top
`# yaml-language-server: $schema=...` line in `kortix.yaml`. That URL is the
public, versioned JSON Schema, generated from `@kortix/manifest-schema` (the
same package that backs `kortix validate` and the CR-merge gate — one source
of truth, no separate spec to keep in sync by hand):

| URL | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `https://kortix.com/schema/kortix.v2.schema.json` | `kortix_version: 2` agent governance map |
| `https://kortix.com/schema/kortix.v1.schema.json` | `kortix_version: 1` only (legacy `[[agents]]` array + `[[channels]]`) |
| `https://kortix.com/schema/kortix.schema.json` | All published versions; dispatches on `kortix_version` |

`kortix schema` (from any session — the CLI is always pre-authenticated, see
`<cli>` above) prints the same document locally: `kortix schema --version 2`,
or `kortix schema --url` for just the URL. If you are AUTHORING or EDITING
`kortix.yaml` and unsure whether a field/shape is legal, this schema — not
this skill's prose, which can drift — is the authoritative structural spec;
`kortix validate` is the authoritative behavioral one (it also catches
cross-field rules the static schema can't express, e.g. `default_agent` must
name a declared agent).

**v2 in one paragraph** (see `<agent-authorization>` below for the fuller
write-up): `agents:` is a name→block MAP (not the v1 `[[agents]]` array),
and every block is **governance only** —
`enabled`/`sandbox`/`connectors`/`secrets`/`skills`/`apps`/`kortix_permissions`/`workspace`. `env` was
renamed `secrets`. There is no `model`/`mode`/`description`/`permission`/
`prompt` on the manifest side at all in v2 — every one of those is agent
behavior and lives in that agent's own `.md` frontmatter — the file
`agents.<name>.file` names, default `agents/<name>.md` (this project's `kortix` and `harness-reflector`
agents both work this way — open their `.md` files to see what they
actually do). `default_agent` is required and must resolve to a declared,
enabled agent. `[[channels]]` is removed outright (channel↔agent routing is
dashboard-managed, not git). v2 is YAML-only and deny-by-default on every
grant set (an omitted `connectors`/`secrets`/`skills`/`apps`/`kortix_permissions`
resolves to `none`, not `all`).

</canonical-schema>

<agent-authorization>
## Per-agent governance — `agents:` (v2) / `[[agents]]` (v1, legacy)

In v2, a logical agent maps by name to an agent file. The manifest
owns **launchability and authority**. Agent behavior stays outside the
manifest, in the agent's `.md`, which both harnesses read.

```yaml
agents:
  release-bot:
    file: agents/release-bot.md         # the agent's .md: frontmatter + prompt
    sandbox: ml                         # default environment for this agent
    connectors: [github]                # which connectors it may call   (default: none)
    apps: [reports-dashboard]           # Kortix App slugs it may open when the App is restricted/private (default: none)
    kortix_permissions: [project.write, project.cr.open]    # what it may do to the project — CLI, API, git (default: none)
```

**Which file owns what — never duplicate across the boundary:**

| Setting | Lives in |
| --- | --- |
| v2 system prompt, `model`, `mode`, tools, and `permission` | the agent's `.md` (`agents.<name>.file`); on OpenCode also `opencode.jsonc` |
| connectors, secrets, skills, `apps`, `kortix_permissions`, workspace, enabled | manifest `agents:` map |

**How the grant resolves at session start:**
- v2 (`kortix.yaml`) is **deny-by-default**: an omitted `connectors`/`secrets`/`skills`/`apps`/`kortix_permissions` on a declared agent resolves to `none`, not `all`. `default_agent` is required and must resolve to a declared, enabled agent — give it `connectors: all`, `secrets: all`, `kortix_permissions: all`, `skills: all` explicitly if it should keep full access.
- v1 (`kortix.toml`, legacy) is **backward-compatible** instead: manifest has **no `[[agents]]`** at all → no agent-grant restriction, agents discovered straight from the OpenCode config directory. Agent **is listed** → its `connectors`/`kortix_permissions` (default each = none if omitted). Manifest **has `[[agents]]` but this agent isn't listed** → default-deny for Kortix grants. The v1 default agent keeps **full access** only while `[[agents]]` is unadopted — the moment you add `[[agents]]`, declare the default agent too or it falls under the unlisted-deny rule.
- **You are the acting principal.** Effective = your `kortix_permissions` ∩ your **ceiling** (the IAM role an admin binds to your service account; with none bound, every grantable project permission). `all`, `"*"`, and any list containing `"*"` mean every permission, including `project.members.manage` and `project.delete`. The one exception is `project.credentials.issue` (`403 agent_human_only_action`): a token you mint would carry none of your permissions. The launcher's role is not an input. The human contributes "may run this agent" and their own personal resources (their connector connections, personal secrets, their computer) — only in their own **private** session, and only until someone else prompts it. Trigger and channel runs have no human behind them.
  - `project.read` in your own project is always granted.
  - When a call returns 403, read `code`: `agent_scope_insufficient` → the action is missing from your `kortix_permissions` (propose a CR); `agent_ceiling_insufficient` → an admin must raise your ceiling role; `agent_not_accessible` → the human may not run that agent; `agent_grant_escalation` → you tried to give an agent (yourself included) a permission, connector, secret or App you do not hold. Never claim an authority the code says you lack.
  - **You grant only what you hold.** Any agent grant you write — through the agent editor, the scope or secret-grant routes, or a CR you merge — may add only what your own effective grant holds. A person widens an agent beyond you. A push straight to the default branch also needs you to hold every grant; otherwise open a CR.
- Editing the manifest only takes effect once the **CR is merged** (read from the default branch). A CR that changes `agents.*` needs `project.agent.write`, `triggers` needs `project.trigger.create|update|delete`, `default_agent` needs `project.customize.write` — on top of `project.gitops.merge`. With `kortix_permissions: all` you hold them all and merge such a CR yourself. A push straight to the default branch needs `project.gitops.ref.any` plus all of those. A `503 CR_GOVERNANCE_UNVERIFIED` means the manifest could not be read; nothing merged, retry after `Retry-After` seconds. An older server answers `403 CR_AGENT_GOVERNANCE_CHANGE`; only a person can merge it there.
- Check what you hold with `kortix whoami --token-only`. If it says `none` right after a `kortix.yaml` change, the change broke your grant: revert it before anything else.
- Session environment precedence is explicit `sandbox_slug`, agent `sandbox`, project `sandbox.default`, then platform `default`. Triggers, schedules, and channels use the target agent's environment.

**Discovery contract:**
- Declaring `agents:` (v2) or `[[agents]]` (v1) opts into declarative,
  server-side agent discovery. Agent files can exist without becoming
  launchable logical agents.
- Once a project adopts declarative agents, Kortix chat inputs, trigger/channel pickers, and other product UI should fetch agents from the server-side Kortix registry, not directly from the sandbox runtime.
- Model lists should follow the same direction: UI fetches the server/LLM-gateway model catalog, not a sandbox-local provider list, so connected-provider policy and billing stay server-owned.
- New projects use v2 declarative discovery. Older `kortix.toml` (v1)
  projects stay in legacy mode until they migrate.

**`kortix_permissions` — the grantable enum** (`kortix_cli` is the deprecated spelling, still accepted with a validation warning; project-scoped only; account-level admin actions
like `member.*` / `billing.*` / `project.create` can NEVER be granted to an agent. One project
action is **HUMAN_ONLY** — `project.credentials.issue`: it validates in the manifest, but an agent never holds it).
Run `kortix validate --scopes` to print this list:

```
project.read  project.write
project.cr.open  project.cr.merge          # opening a CR ≠ merging it (merge lands code on main)
project.session.read  project.session.start  project.session.stop  project.session.bindings.write
project.members.read
project.trigger.read  project.trigger.create  project.trigger.update  project.trigger.delete  project.trigger.fire
project.gateway.logs.read  project.gateway.spend.read  project.gateway.budget.set
project.agent.read  project.agent.write
project.skill.read  project.skill.write
project.command.read  project.command.write
project.file.read  project.file.write
project.settings.write  project.sandbox.write
project.model.read  project.model.write
project.gitops.read  project.gitops.push  project.gitops.merge
project.secret.read  project.secret.write
project.connector.read  project.connector.write  project.connector.connections.manage   # channels (Slack/meet/email) send + connect are gated here
project.review.read  project.review.submit  project.review.act
```

`kortix validate` validates `agents:` (v2) / `[[agents]]` (v1) — rejecting unknown /
account-scoped actions — and prints each agent's resolved scope. Use `kortix validate --scopes`
to see the full enum.

<gotchas>
Things that surprise people:

- **The workspace IS global — sessions are not.** A Kortix project is
  one big GitHub repo everyone shares. Persistent changes happen by
  committing to the session branch and **opening a change request**
  that merges back to `main`. Every session — even thousands running
  concurrently — gets its own isolated sandbox + ephemeral branch.
  Branches can `git pull` from `main` to pick up the latest. Merging
  back to `main` is how anything becomes persistent, and the *only*
  sanctioned path is `kortix cr open` → user review → merge.
- **Merging to `main` is a CR — there is no other path.** Direct
  pushes to `main` from inside the sandbox skip the user-review
  contract and surprise the user. If an agent has changes worth
  keeping, the next move is *always* `kortix cr open`, never a force
  push, never asking the user to copy files out. See the
  `<change-requests>` section above.
- **Triggers live in `kortix.yaml`, not as files.** Old Kortix shipped
  triggers under `.opencode/triggers/<slug>.md` — that's gone.
  Centralized in the manifest now, parsed as `triggers:`.
- **Harness-neutral files live at the repo root; harness files under
  `harnesses/`.** Agents (`agents/`), skills (`skills/`) and memory
  (`memory/`) serve every harness. OpenCode's own files — commands, tools,
  plugins, MCP, providers — sit in `harnesses/opencode/`, declared through
  `opencode.config_dir`. pi's own files — extensions, prompt templates,
  `settings.json` — sit in `harnesses/pi/`, declared through `pi.config_dir`.
  The pre-2026-09 `.kortix/opencode/` layout still works.
- **A harness reads only its own directory.** An OpenCode plugin, custom
  tool, command or `opencode.jsonc` setting does nothing in a pi session, and
  a pi extension does nothing in an OpenCode session. Check the harness
  first (`<harnesses>` above).
- **An agent is two halves.** Its `.md` holds behavior; its `agents:` entry
  in `kortix.yaml` holds what it may access. Declaring an agent there is a
  separate Kortix decision.
- **Provider verification is a real prompt.** A generic key check cannot prove
  a model, region, entitlement, and API dialect together. Test the exact
  model through a session prompt.
- **Manifest schema is versioned.** `kortix_version` lets the platform
  evolve safely. A manifest declaring a higher version than the platform
  knows about is rejected outright — better than silent misread.
- **`env.required` is advisory, not enforced.** The platform surfaces
  `required` to the dashboard so the user knows what to set, but session
  bootstrap won't block on missing values today. Treat `required` as a
  contract with the user, not the platform.
