# Economic Systems: Fictional Economy Design Skill

You help writers create authentic economic systems for fictional worlds by applying the ten core principles that govern how real economies form, function, and evolve. This produces economies that drive plot and character rather than serving as backdrop.

## Core Principles

1. **Resource Foundation**: Economic systems are shaped by available resources and their distribution
2. **Exchange Evolution**: Trade evolves from barter to complex financial instruments through abstraction
3. **Production Organization**: How labor is organized determines productive capacity and social relationships
4. **Institutional Embeddedness**: Economic activities operate within cultural, political, and social constraints
5. **Technological Determinism**: Available technologies shape what economic activities are possible
6. **Scarcity-Abundance Spectrum**: Systems respond differently to scarcity versus abundance
7. **Center-Periphery Dynamics**: Core and peripheral regions create distinctive economic patterns
8. **Formal-Informal Balance**: All economies contain both official and shadow components
9. **Subsistence-Surplus Transition**: Moving beyond subsistence enables specialization and complexity
10. **Cyclical Patterns**: Economies display recurring patterns of growth, crisis, and adaptation

- [ ] Create trade networks and routes
- [ ] Establish labor organization
- [ ] Design wealth distribution pattern
- [ ] Create at least one economic crisis in history

- [ ] Plan future economic pressures for plot

## Output Persistence

This skill writes primary output to files so work persists across sessions.

### Output Discovery
1. Check for `context/output-config.md` in the project
2. If found, look for this skill's entry
3. If not found, ask user: "Where should I save economic system designs?"
4. Suggest: `worldbuilding/economics/` or `explorations/worldbuilding/`

### Primary Output
- **Economic parameters** - Chosen values for each category
- **Currency design** - Naming, backing, properties
- **Trade networks** - Routes, dependencies, barriers
- **Class structure** - Economic stratification
- **Shadow economy** - Informal/black market elements

### File Naming
Pattern: `{world-name}-economics-{date}.md`

## Verification (Oracle)

### What This Skill Can Verify
- **Parameter coverage** - Have all 10 categories been considered? (High confidence)
- **Internal consistency** - Do economic choices support each other? (Medium confidence)
- **Technology match** - Does financial complexity match technological capacity? (High confidence)

### What Requires Human Judgment
- **Story fit** - Does this economy create interesting conflicts?
- **Plausibility** - Would this system actually function?
- **Genre appropriateness** - Does complexity level match reader expectations?

### Oracle Limitations
- Cannot assess narrative interest of economic design
- Cannot predict how economy affects character motivation without story context

## Feedback Loop

### Session Persistence
- **Output location:** See `context/output-config.md`
- **What to save:** Parameter choices, currency design, trade networks, shadow economy
- **Naming pattern:** `{world-name}-economics-{date}.md`

### Cross-Session Learning
- Check for prior economic work on this world
- Ensure new economic elements maintain consistency
- Economic crises and adaptations inform anti-patterns

## Design Constraints

### This Skill Assumes
- World has resources to distribute (even post-scarcity has rare things)
- Economic activity exists (even gift economies)
- Writer wants systematic rather than background economics

### This Skill Does Not Handle
- **Political structures** - Route to: governance-systems
- **Cultural values** - Route to: belief-systems
- **General worldbuilding** - Route to: worldbuilding

### Degradation Signals
- Economy exists only as backdrop without affecting characters
- Single commodity without supporting sectors
- Modern financial concepts in pre-industrial settings

## Reasoning Requirements

### Standard Reasoning
- Parameter selection for single category
- Currency naming and properties
- Basic trade route design

### Extended Reasoning (ultrathink)
- **Full system design** - [Why: all 10 categories interconnect]
- **Economy-politics integration** - [Why: requires cross-skill synthesis]
- **Historical economic development** - [Why: tracing evolution through time]

**Trigger phrases:** "design the complete economy", "how do economics affect politics", "economic history"

## Execution Strategy

### Sequential (Default)
- Resource parameters before production parameters
- Production before exchange systems
- Exchange before distribution

### Parallelizable
- Research into multiple historical economic systems
- Developing different regional economies

### Subagent Candidates
| Task | Agent Type | When to Spawn |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Historical research | general-purpose | When modeling on real economic systems |
| Political integration | general-purpose | When coordinating with governance-systems |

## Context Management

### Approximate Token Footprint
- **Skill base:** ~4k tokens (10 categories + typologies)
- **With case studies:** ~5k tokens
- **Full parameter tables:** ~6k tokens

### Context Optimization
- Load only relevant parameter categories for current task
- Reference governance-systems/belief-systems by name
- Case studies are optional examples

### When Context Gets Tight
- Prioritize: Current parameter category, currency design basics
- Defer: Full typologies, all case studies
- Drop: Setting-specific adaptations not in use

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Single-Commodity Dependency
**Pattern:** Building the entire economy around one resource (spice, unobtanium, magic crystals) without supporting sectors.
**Why it fails:** Real economies require food production, manufacturing, services, and infrastructure regardless of what the prestige export is. Monocultures collapse when that commodity fails.
**Fix:** Design supporting economic sectors. Even a spice-exporting world needs farmers, transporters, administrators, and entertainers. The key resource should dominate politics, not eliminate other economics.

### 2. Convenient Currency
**Pattern:** Creating coins or credits without considering who issues them, what backs them, or how they maintain value.
**Why it fails:** Currency is a social technology with failure modes. Counterfeiting, debasement, trust crises, and exchange rate chaos create story opportunities that generic "gold coins" miss.
**Fix:** Decide who issues currency, what backs its value, and what happens when that issuer's authority is questioned. Multiple competing currencies create richer dynamics.

### 3. Modern Economics in Medieval Clothing
**Pattern:** Applying contemporary financial concepts (stock markets, complex credit) to pre-industrial settings without the prerequisites.
**Why it fails:** Financial instruments require information systems, legal frameworks, and enforcement mechanisms that didn't exist. A peasant village can't have a derivatives market.
**Fix:** Match financial complexity to technological and institutional capacity. Guild-controlled trade and reputation-based credit precede anonymous market transactions.

### 4. Frictionless Trade
**Pattern:** Goods moving freely across vast distances without transportation costs, spoilage, banditry, or political barriers.
**Why it fails:** Trade friction shapes what's traded and where. High-value, low-weight goods travel far; bulky staples stay local. Eliminating friction removes interesting constraints.
**Fix:** Consider transport technology, preservation, security costs, and tolls. Trade routes should explain why certain goods concentrate in certain places.

### 5. Invisible Labor
**Pattern:** Luxury economies existing without showing who does the basic work—farming, cleaning, building—that enables elite activities.
**Why it fails:** Someone produces the food, maintains the buildings, and handles waste. Invisible labor creates implausible abundance and misses class-conflict opportunities.
**Fix:** Account for labor at every level. Show or acknowledge the workers. Create tensions between those who produce value and those who extract it.
