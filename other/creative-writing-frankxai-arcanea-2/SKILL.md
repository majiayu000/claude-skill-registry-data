# Creative Writing Frameworks

> **Craft compelling narratives with proven structures and techniques**

This skill provides frameworks for developing stories, characters, and distinctive voices—whether for fiction, content marketing, or product narratives.

## Core Principles

### 1. Story Is Structure
Every compelling narrative follows recognizable patterns. Understanding these patterns allows you to innovate within them.

### 2. Voice Is Identity
A distinctive voice makes writing memorable. Develop it intentionally, not accidentally.

### 3. Show, Then Tell
Let readers experience before explaining. The most powerful writing creates feelings before understanding.

## Narrative Structures

### The Hero's Journey (Monomyth)

Classic structure for transformational stories.

### Three-Act Structure

Versatile framework for most narratives.

```

### The Story Circle (Dan Harmon)

Simplified monomyth in 8 steps.

```
                    YOU (1)
                      │
           ┌─────────┴─────────┐
           │                   │
     CHANGE (8)           NEED (2)
           │                   │
           │    ┌───────┐      │
           │    │       │      │
           │    │ ZONE  │      │
     RETURN (7)─┤   OF  ├─GO (3)

           │    └───────┘      │
           │                   │
      PAY (6)             SEARCH (4)
           │                   │

                     │
                  FIND (5)

1. YOU - Character in their zone of comfort
2. NEED - But they want something
3. GO - They enter unfamiliar situation
4. SEARCH - Adapt to it
5. FIND - Get what they wanted
6. PAY - Pay a heavy price for it
7. RETURN - Return to familiar situation
8. CHANGE - Having changed
```

### MICE Quotient

Determine your story's focus and structure.

| Type | Opens With | Closes With | Focus |
|------|------------|-------------|-------|
| **M**ilieu | Enter a place | Leave that place | World/setting |
| **I**dea | Question posed | Question answered | Mystery/learning |
| **C**haracter | Dissatisfied self | New equilibrium | Identity/growth |
| **E**vent | Status quo disrupted | New status quo | Action/plot |

## Character Development

### The Character Diamond

Four dimensions that create compelling characters.

```
                    WANT
                (External Goal)
                      │
                      │
         ┌───────────┼───────────┐
         │           │           │
         │           │           │
    FEAR ├───────────┼───────────┤ NEED
(What holds         │         (Internal
 them back)         │           Goal)
         │           │           │
         │           │           │
         └───────────┼───────────┘
                      │
                      │
                   WOUND
              (Origin of Fear)
```

**Example:**

```yaml
Character: Marcus, reluctant hero

Want: "To be left alone and run my bookshop"
Need: "To find belonging and purpose"
Fear: "Being responsible for others' suffering"
Wound: "Caused his sister's death through negligence"

Dynamic: Marcus's want (isolation) and need (belonging)
         are in direct conflict. His fear prevents him
         from what he truly needs. The story forces him
         to confront this through events that require
         him to take responsibility for others.
```

### Character Voice Checklist

What makes a character's voice distinctive:

```yaml
Voice Components:
  Vocabulary:
    - Education level (sesquipedalian vs simple)
    - Regional influences (y'all, wicked, hella)
    - Professional jargon (legal, medical, tech)
    - Era-specific terms (groovy, based, lit)

  Rhythm:
    - Sentence length patterns (short, punchy vs flowing)
    - Pause patterns (em-dashes, ellipses, periods)
    - Question frequency
    - Exclamation usage

  Perspective:
    - Optimist vs pessimist
    - Internal vs external focus
    - Past vs future orientation
    - Self vs other focus

  Quirks:
    - Catchphrases
    - Verbal tics (you know, like, basically)
    - Topics they always return to
    - Things they never mention
```

### The OCEAN Model for Personality

Use psychological traits to build consistent characters.

| Trait | Low | High |
|-------|-----|------|
| **O**penness | Practical, conventional | Creative, curious |
| **C**onscientiousness | Flexible, spontaneous | Organized, disciplined |
| **E**xtraversion | Reserved, solitary | Outgoing, energetic |
| **A**greeableness | Challenging, detached | Cooperative, trusting |
| **N**euroticism | Calm, secure | Anxious, volatile |

## Voice Development

### Finding Your Voice

Voice emerges from consistent choices across these dimensions:

```yaml
Voice Framework:

  Formality Spectrum:
    Casual ←──────────────────────→ Formal
    "Hey!" ←──────────────────────→ "Greetings"

  Complexity Spectrum:
    Simple ←──────────────────────→ Complex
    "It's hot" ←──────────────────→ "The ambient temperature..."

  Distance Spectrum:
    Intimate ←──────────────────────→ Distant
    "Between us..." ←──────────────→ "One might observe..."

  Pace Spectrum:
    Staccato ←──────────────────────→ Flowing
    "Stop. Think. Act." ←────────→ "And as the moment unfolds..."

  Emotional Range:
    Restrained ←──────────────────→ Expressive
    "That's unfortunate" ←───────→ "This is devastating!"
```

### Voice Consistency Patterns

```yaml
Voice Pattern: [Name]

# Sentence Starters (common openers)
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]
- [Pattern 3]

# Transitional Phrases
- [Phrase 1]
- [Phrase 2]

# Emphasis Patterns
- How do they stress importance?
- What punctuation do they favor?

# Forbidden Patterns
- Things this voice would NEVER say
- Words that break character

# Rhythm Example
[Write a sample paragraph demonstrating the voice]
```

### Avoiding AI Voice Patterns

Common patterns to eliminate for authentic voice:

```yaml
AI Patterns to Avoid:

  Over-qualification:
    Bad: "It's important to note that..."
    Good: [Just say the thing]

  Excessive hedging:
    Bad: "This could potentially be seen as..."
    Good: "This is..." or "This might be..."

  List dependency:
    Bad: "First... Second... Third... Finally..."
    Good: [Vary structure, integrate points]

  Empty transitions:
    Bad: "Moving on to the next point..."
    Good: [Direct connection or none]

  Overly balanced:
    Bad: "On one hand... on the other hand..."
    Good: [Take a position, acknowledge nuance naturally]

  Superlative stacking:
    Bad: "Incredibly powerful and remarkably effective"
    Good: "Effective" or "Powerful"
```

## Scene Construction

### Scene Purpose Checklist

Every scene must accomplish at least two:

- [ ] Advance the plot
- [ ] Reveal character
- [ ] Provide necessary information
- [ ] Create emotional resonance
- [ ] Establish or change setting
- [ ] Increase tension/stakes

### Scene Structure Template

```yaml
Scene: [Name]

Setup:
  POV: Who experiences this?
  Location: Where?
  Time: When?
  Characters Present: Who's here?
  Goal: What does POV character want in this scene?

Conflict:
  Obstacle: What prevents the goal?
  Stakes: What happens if they fail?

Resolution:
  Outcome: Success / Failure / Partial / Complicated
  Change: How is situation different at scene end?
  Hook: What pulls reader to next scene?

Beats:
  1. [First beat - typically establishing]
  2. [Second beat - complication]
  3. [Third beat - escalation]
  4. [Fourth beat - turning point]
  5. [Fifth beat - resolution/hook]
```

### Dialogue Craft

```yaml
Dialogue Principles:

  Subtext Over Text:
    - Characters rarely say exactly what they mean
    - Conflict lives between the lines
    - Let readers infer

  Distinct Voices:
    - Each character speaks differently
    - Remove dialogue tags; can you tell who's speaking?
    - Vocabulary, rhythm, concerns should vary

  Compression:
    - Cut pleasantries unless characterizing
    - Enter scenes late, leave early
    - Every line should work

  Action Beats:
    - Replace "said" with meaningful action
    - Show emotion through physicality
    - Pace with beats

Example:
  Bad:
    "I'm really angry at you," she said angrily.

  Better:
    Sarah's coffee cup hit the table. "You knew."
```

## Content Narrative Frameworks

### Problem-Agitation-Solution (PAS)

Classic framework for persuasive content.

```
PROBLEM
  │ Identify the pain point
  │ "Are you struggling with X?"
  │
  ▼
AGITATION
  │ Twist the knife (empathetically)
  │ "And isn't it frustrating when..."
  │
  ▼
SOLUTION
    Present your answer
    "Here's how to fix it..."
```

### Before-After-Bridge (BAB)

Show transformation.

```
BEFORE
  │ Current painful state
  │
  ▼
AFTER
  │ Desirable future state
  │
  ▼
BRIDGE
    How to get there
```

### AIDA for Narrative Content

Attention → Interest → Desire → Action

```yaml
Attention:
  - Hook that stops the scroll
  - Unexpected opening
  - Bold claim or question

Interest:
  - Story that illustrates the point
  - Data that surprises
  - Insight that reframes

Desire:
  - Benefits clearly stated
  - Social proof
  - Future pacing

Action:
  - Clear next step
  - Low friction
  - Urgency without manipulation
```
