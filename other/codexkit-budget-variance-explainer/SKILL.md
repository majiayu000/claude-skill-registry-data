# Budget Variance Explainer

## Purpose

Make budget data understandable for non-finance managers so they can act on it.

## When to use

- a team lead receives budget vs actual numbers and needs to understand them
- a department manager needs to explain their cost center to leadership
- monthly or quarterly financial reviews for non-finance stakeholders
- translating finance team output into operational language

## When not to use

- technical accounting analysis or journal entries
- external audit preparation or regulatory reporting
- when the variance requires forensic investigation

## Inputs

- budget vs actual data (table, spreadsheet extract, or raw numbers)
- time period (month, quarter, YTD)
- any known context (e.g. "we hired 2 extra people" or "project X was delayed")
- audience (team lead, VP, non-finance manager)

## Procedure

1. Identify the top 3–5 variances by absolute dollar impact.
2. Classify each:  favorable or unfavorable.
3. Explain WHY each variance happened in one sentence (driver).
4. Determine if the variance is one-time or recurring.
5. Suggest what action to take for each significant variance.
6. Write a 2-sentence headline summary suitable for an exec email.
7. Produce an action table: driver → impact → owner → action.

## Output

- headline summary (2 sentences)
- variance explanation table (line item, variance, driver, one-time/recurring, action)
- recommended talking points for presenting to leadership

## Definition of done

- every variance > 5% is explained
- explanations use business language, not accounting jargon
- each significant variance has an owner and recommended action
- a non-finance person can understand the summary without follow-up questions

## Examples

- "Explain why our department is $30K over budget this month in plain English."
- "Turn this spreadsheet into talking points for the VP meeting."
- "Our travel spend is 40% over plan — write an explanation and recommended action."

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Data sources and assumptions are explicitly stated
- [ ] Calculations are reproducible from provided inputs
- [ ] Visualizations or tables have clear labels, units, and time ranges
- [ ] Caveats and confidence levels are documented for estimates

## Verification (4C)

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Are formulas, aggregations, and statistical methods applied correctly? |
| **Completeness** | Does the analysis cover all requested metrics and time ranges? |
| **Context-fit** | Are the chosen metrics relevant to the business question being answered? |
| **Consequence** | If this data were used for a decision today, what blind spots remain? |

## Edge Cases

- **Missing or incomplete data** — Document gaps and their potential impact on conclusions. Provide ranges instead of point estimates.
- **Outliers skewing results** — Report with and without outliers. Document the decision to include or exclude.
- **Changing data definitions mid-period** — Split analysis at the change boundary and note the schema difference.
