# AppDirect  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `appdirect-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/appdirect/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/appdirect/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `appdirect-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `appdirect-cli` and `appdirect-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

AppDirect partners manage thousands of subscriptions across hundreds of companies through a click-heavy console or hand-rolled curl with hourly-expiring OAuth tokens. This CLI mints and caches tokens invisibly, wraps the full marketplace REST surface (subscriptions, companies, users, billing, assisted sales, catalog), and syncs it all to local SQLite so commands like 'reconcile', 'subs changed', and 'pipeline' answer cross-entity questions no console screen can.

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI for AppDirect marketplace operations: listing and managing subscriptions, companies, users, and memberships; pulling invoices and payments; reconciling billing; and working assisted-sales pipelines. It shines on cross-entity questions (billing mismatches, churn, stale deals) because everything syncs to a local SQLite store that supports search, SQL, and joins.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Building or theming a marketplace storefront - that is @appdirect/sfb-toolkit, not this CLI
- Developing ISV product connectors / integration event handlers - use the AppDirect connector SDKs
- End-user purchases on a marketplace you do not operate - this CLI needs partner API credentials
- AppDirect GraphQL-only surfaces (newer product/catalog graph queries) - this CLI wraps the REST API

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local joins that close the books
- **`reconcile`**  -  Flag active subscriptions with no matching invoice, orphan invoices, and failed or unpaid payments across every company before month-close.

  _Reach for this when asked whether billing matches reality across the marketplace  -  it answers in one call what otherwise takes hundreds of per-company console lookups._

  ```bash
  appdirect-cli reconcile --since 30d --agent
  ```
- **`payments unpaid`**  -  List failed or unavailable-gateway payments across all companies, sorted by amount and age.

  _Use this for the weekly failed-payment chase instead of paging through company billing screens._

  ```bash
  appdirect-cli payments unpaid --since 7d --json
  ```
- **`company show`**  -  One customer's full picture - users, subscriptions, invoices, and open opportunities - in a single view.

  _Pick this for onboarding or support questions about a specific customer instead of four separate API calls._

  ```bash
  appdirect-cli company show 12345678-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-1234567890ab --json
  ```

### Change radar
- **`subs changed`**  -  See subscriptions created, ended, or in an inactive status (suspended/cancelled/failed) across all companies in a time window.

  _Use this for churn checks and weekly change review across the whole marketplace._

  ```bash
  appdirect-cli subs changed --since 7d --json
  ```

### Pipeline as data
- **`pipeline`**  -  Roll up the assisted-sales pipeline by status or owner with opportunity counts and ages.

  _Use this when asked for a pipeline rollup by status or owner instead of opening each opportunity._

  ```bash
  appdirect-cli pipeline --group-by status --agent
  ```
- **`pipeline stale`**  -  Find open opportunities created more than N days ago, oldest first.

  _Use this to surface stalled deals before they die quietly._

  ```bash
  appdirect-cli pipeline stale --days 14 --json
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
appdirect-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Month-close billing reconciliation

```bash
appdirect-cli reconcile --since 30d --agent --select findings.kind,findings.subscriptionId,findings.companyName
```

Narrow the reconciliation report to just the mismatch type, subscription, and company for fast agent triage.

### Weekly failed-payment chase

```bash
appdirect-cli payments unpaid --since 7d --json
```

Failed, declined, and overdue payments across all companies, sorted by amount and age.

### What changed this week

```bash
appdirect-cli subs changed --since 7d --json
```

Cross-company subscription lifecycle diff - created, cancelled, suspended.

### Pipeline review before forecast call

```bash
appdirect-cli pipeline --group-by status --agent
```

Opportunity counts and ages rolled up by status from the local store.

### Customer snapshot for a support ticket

```bash
appdirect-cli company show 12345678-aaaa-bbbb-cccc-1234567890ab --json
```

Users, subscriptions, invoices, and open opportunities for one company in a single payload.

## Auth Setup

AppDirect uses OAuth 2.0 client-credentials per marketplace. Create an API client in your marketplace settings (Settings > API Clients), then set three environment variables: APPDIRECT_BASE_URL (your marketplace host, e.g. https://marketplace.appdirect.com), APPDIRECT_CLIENT_ID, and APPDIRECT_CLIENT_SECRET. The CLI mints bearer tokens from <base-url>/oauth2/token automatically and re-mints on expiry - no manual token handling. Client-credentials grants are limited to the ROLE_PARTNER and ROLE_PARTNER_READ scopes; user-context endpoints outside those scopes will return 403.

Run `appdirect-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  appdirect-cli account resource-company-create-active-user-post <id> --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
appdirect-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
appdirect-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
appdirect-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/appdirect-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `APPDIRECT_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `APPDIRECT_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
appdirect-cli profile save briefing --json
appdirect-cli --profile briefing account resource-company-create-active-user-post <id>
appdirect-cli profile list --json
appdirect-cli profile show briefing
appdirect-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Async Jobs

For endpoints that submit long-running work, the generator detects the submit-then-poll pattern (a `job_id`/`task_id`/`operation_id` field in the response plus a sibling status endpoint) and wires up three extra flags on the submitting command:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--wait` | Block until the job reaches a terminal status instead of returning the job ID immediately |
| `--wait-timeout` | Maximum wait duration (default 10m, 0 means no timeout) |
| `--wait-interval` | Initial poll interval (default 2s; grows with exponential backoff up to 30s) |

Use async submission without `--wait` when you want to fire-and-forget; use `--wait` when you want one command to return the finished artifact.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `appdirect-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add appdirect-mcp -- appdirect-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which appdirect-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   appdirect-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `appdirect-cli <command> --help`.
