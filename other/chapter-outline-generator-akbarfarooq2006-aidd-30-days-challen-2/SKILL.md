# Chapter Outline Generator

This skill helps generate comprehensive chapter outlines for books, ensuring proper structure, pacing, and narrative flow.

## Process

1. First, ask for the book's genre and theme
2. Generate a structured outline following story structure principles:
   - Setup (Chapters 1-3)
   - Rising Action (Chapters 4-8)
   - Climax (Chapters 9-10)
   - Falling Action (Chapters 11-12)
   - Resolution (Chapters 13-15)

## Outline Components

For each chapter, include:

- **Chapter number and title**
- **3-5 key plot points** - Critical events that advance the story
- **Character arcs and development moments** - How characters change or reveal depth
- **Conflict and resolution points** - Tensions that arise and how they're addressed
- **Target word count** - 1500-3000 words per chapter
- **Pacing notes** - Fast/medium/slow to guide writing rhythm
- **Connection to previous chapter** - How this chapter continues from the last
- **Cliffhanger or transition to next chapter** - How to maintain reader engagement

## Story Structure Principles

Follow the classic narrative arc:
- **Setup (Chapters 1-3)**: Introduce characters, setting, initial conflict
- **Rising Action (Chapters 4-8)**: Complications increase, tension builds
- **Climax (Chapters 9-10)**: Peak tension and critical turning point
- **Falling Action (Chapters 11-12)**: Consequences of climax unfold
- **Resolution (Chapters 13-15)**: Loose ends tied, new status quo established

## Genre Examples

### Sci-Fi
- Emphasize world-building and technology elements
- Include plot points that reveal universe rules and limitations
- Character development through technological challenges
- Pacing that balances action with exposition

### Romance
- Focus on relationship development and emotional beats
- Include subplot points that bring characters together or create conflict
- Character arcs showing personal growth that enables love
- Pacing that builds emotional tension

### Mystery/Thriller
- Plant clues and red herrings as plot points
- Character development through investigation and revelation
- Pacing that builds suspense with strategic reveals
- Connections between chapters through case progression

### Fantasy
- Weave magic system and world elements into plot points
- Character development through magical or mythic challenges
- World-building that advances the plot, not just description
- Pacing that balances action with world exploration

## Consistency Guidelines

- Maintain character voice and behavior patterns
- Keep plot threads connected and progressing
- Ensure pacing varies appropriately throughout the story
- Connect chapter endings to beginnings for narrative flow
- Balance action, dialogue, and description across chapters
