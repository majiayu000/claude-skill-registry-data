# Insurance Analyst

Comprehensive insurance analysis system designed for insurance professionals, risk managers, business owners, and individuals navigating complex insurance decisions. This skill provides policy comparison, coverage gap analysis, claims evaluation, risk assessment, and insurance purchasing guidance across personal and commercial insurance lines.

The Insurance Analyst excels at breaking down policy language into understandable terms, identifying coverage gaps and overlaps, evaluating claims scenarios, comparing policies and pricing, assessing business and personal risk exposures, and recommending appropriate coverage levels and deductibles. It's valuable for insurance agents, brokers, risk managers, CFOs, and consumers making informed insurance decisions.

**Important Disclaimer:** This skill provides educational information and analytical frameworks about insurance. It does NOT constitute insurance advice, legal advice, or a substitute for working with licensed insurance professionals. Insurance is highly regulated, state-specific, and contract-based. Always work with licensed insurance agents/brokers and legal counsel for specific coverage recommendations, policy interpretation, and claims guidance.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Policy Analysis & Coverage Review

**Purpose:** Thoroughly understand insurance policies, identify coverage, exclusions, limitations, and gaps.

**Policy Components:**

**1. Declarations Page ("Dec Page")**
- Named insured (who is covered)
- Policy period (effective dates)
- Coverages purchased and limits
- Deductibles
- Premium amount
- Property/vehicles/locations covered
- **Read this first** - Quick summary of what you bought

**2. Insuring Agreement**
- What the insurer promises to cover
- Triggering events that activate coverage
- Scope of protection
- Basic obligations of insurer and insured

**3. Definitions**
- Key terms used throughout policy
- Often surprisingly limiting
- Example: "Property damage" may exclude certain types of damage
- **Always read definitions** - They control interpretation

**4. Coverages**
- Detailed description of what's covered
- Sub-limits (coverage within coverage)
- Extensions (additional coverages)
- **Example (Homeowners):**
  - Coverage A: Dwelling
  - Coverage B: Other structures
  - Coverage C: Personal property
  - Coverage D: Loss of use
  - Coverage E: Personal liability
  - Coverage F: Medical payments

**5. Exclusions**
- What is NOT covered
- **Most important section** - Exclusions eliminate coverage
- Common exclusions: Intentional acts, war, nuclear, wear and tear, earth movement, flood
- Can be broad (entire category) or specific

**6. Conditions**
- Obligations and procedures
- Duties after loss (notification, cooperation, proof of loss)
- Cancellation provisions
- How disputes are resolved
- **Failure to comply can void coverage**

**7. Endorsements**
- Modifications to base policy
- Can add, remove, or clarify coverage
- May increase or decrease premium
- Read carefully - can significantly change coverage

**Policy Analysis Framework:**

**Step 1: Identify Coverage Triggers**
- What event must occur for coverage to apply?
- "Occurrence" vs. "Claims-made" (liability insurance)
- "All risk" vs. "Named peril" (property insurance)
- Timing requirements (when did event occur vs. when reported?)

**Step 2: Determine Coverage Scope**
- Who is covered? (named insured, family, employees, etc.)
- What is covered? (types of property, types of liability)
- Where is coverage provided? (geographic limitations)
- When does coverage apply? (policy period, retroactive dates)
- How much coverage? (limits, sub-limits, deductibles)

**Step 3: Identify Exclusions**
- What categories of loss are excluded?
- Are there exceptions to exclusions (coverage buy-back)?
- Do any endorsements modify exclusions?

**Step 4: Understand Conditions**
- Notification requirements (how quickly must you report?)
- Cooperation obligations
- Other insurance provisions (how policy coordinates with other policies)
- Duties after loss

**Step 5: Calculate Net Coverage**
- Policy limit
- Less: Deductible
- Less: Depreciation (if applicable - ACV vs. RCV)
- Less: Sub-limits for specific property/perils
- Less: Prior claims against policy (if aggregate limit)
- = Available coverage

**Common Policy Types:**

**Personal Lines:**
- **Homeowners (HO-3):** Dwelling all-risk, personal property named peril
- **Renters (HO-4):** Personal property and liability
- **Condo (HO-6):** Personal property, improvements, liability
- **Auto:** Liability, collision, comprehensive, uninsured motorist
- **Umbrella:** Excess liability over underlying auto/home
- **Life:** Term, whole life, universal life
- **Disability:** Income replacement if unable to work
- **Health:** Medical expenses, deductibles, copays, out-of-pocket max

**Commercial Lines:**
- **General Liability (CGL):** Third-party bodily injury and property damage
- **Professional Liability (E&O):** Errors, omissions, negligence in services
- **Property:** Building and contents, business income
- **Workers' Compensation:** Employee injury and illness
- **Commercial Auto:** Vehicles used for business
- **Cyber Liability:** Data breaches, cyber attacks, privacy violations
- **Directors & Officers (D&O):** Protection for company leadership
- **Employment Practices Liability (EPLI):** Employment-related claims

**Deliverables:**
- Policy summary document (plain English)
- Coverage checklist (what's covered, what's not)
- Exclusions analysis
- Coverage gap identification
- Recommendations for additional or modified coverage

### Workflow 2: Claims Evaluation & Management

**Purpose:** Assess claim viability, navigate claims process, and maximize recovery.

**Claims Process:**

**Step 1: Incident Response**
- **Immediate actions:**
  - Ensure safety (people first, property second)
  - Mitigate further damage (duty to mitigate)
  - Document everything (photos, videos, witness statements)
  - Preserve evidence (don't dispose of damaged property until adjuster sees it)
  - Contact authorities if required (police, fire, OSHA)

**Step 2: Policy Review**
- Review policy to determine if incident is covered
- Identify relevant coverage sections
- Note exclusions that might apply
- Check notification deadlines
- Gather policy documents (declarations, policy form, endorsements)

**Step 3: Notification**
- **Report to insurer promptly** (delays can jeopardize coverage)
- Typical methods: Phone, online portal, agent
- Information to provide:
  - Policy number
  - Date, time, location of incident
  - Description of what happened
  - Parties involved
  - Estimated damages
  - Police/incident report number if applicable
- Get claim number and adjuster contact information

**Step 4: Documentation**
- **Property claims:**
  - Photos/videos of damage
  - Receipts or proof of ownership
  - Repair estimates
  - Inventory of damaged items
  - Receipts for temporary repairs or living expenses
- **Liability claims:**
  - Incident description
  - Witness statements
  - Police report
  - Medical records/bills (if injury)
  - Correspondence with claimant
- **Auto claims:**
  - Photos of all vehicles
  - Police report
  - Driver information (all parties)
  - Witness statements
  - Damage estimates

**Step 5: Adjuster Inspection**
- Insurance company will assign adjuster
- Schedule inspection promptly
- Be present during inspection
- Point out all damage (easy to overlook items)
- Ask questions and take notes
- Get adjuster's assessment and timeline

**Step 6: Claim Evaluation**
- Adjuster determines coverage and valuation
- **Actual Cash Value (ACV):** Replacement cost minus depreciation
- **Replacement Cost Value (RCV):** Cost to replace with new
- Recoverable depreciation (if RCV policy): Get ACV first, RCV after repairs complete
- Review adjuster's estimate (get independent estimate if too low)

**Step 7: Negotiation**
- If you disagree with adjuster's assessment:
  - Get second opinion (contractor, appraiser)
  - Provide documentation supporting higher value
  - Escalate to adjuster's supervisor if needed
  - Consider public adjuster (works for you, typically 10-15% of settlement)
  - Appraisal clause (many policies have dispute resolution mechanism)

**Step 8: Settlement**
- Accept offer or negotiate
- Payment methods:
  - Check to insured
  - Check to insured and contractor (if repairs)
  - Check to insured and mortgage holder (if mortgaged property)
- Understand what you're releasing (some settlements are final)

**Step 9: Repair & Recovery**
- Complete repairs
- Submit receipts for recoverable depreciation
- Keep records of all expenses
- Deduct reimbursement from insurance when filing taxes (if applicable)

**Common Claim Issues:**

**Underpayment:**
- Adjuster's estimate too low
- Depreciation calculation excessive
- Missed items or damage
- **Solution:** Get independent estimate, document discrepancies, negotiate

**Denial:**
- Claim falls under exclusion
- Policy lapsed or not in effect
- Late reporting
- Failure to cooperate
- Material misrepresentation on application
- **Solution:** Review denial letter, understand reason, appeal if appropriate

**Delay:**
- Adjuster slow to respond
- Waiting for approvals
- Disputes over coverage or value
- **Solution:** Document delays, escalate to supervisor, contact state insurance department if unreasonable

**Subrogation:**
- Insurance company recovers from responsible third party after paying you
- You may need to cooperate (provide information, testimony)
- If you settle with third party, may affect insurance recovery

**Bad Faith:**
- Insurer unreasonably denies or delays claim
- Fails to investigate properly
- Lowballs offer without justification
- Misrepresents policy provisions
- **Serious issue:** Contact attorney, file complaint with state insurance department

**Deliverables:**
- Claim checklist (required documentation and steps)
- Loss documentation package
- Claim correspondence log
- Negotiation talking points
- Settlement evaluation

### Workflow 3: Risk Assessment & Coverage Planning

**Purpose:** Identify exposures, quantify potential losses, and structure appropriate insurance program.

**Personal Risk Assessment:**

**1. Property Exposures**
- **Home:**
  - Replacement cost (not market value)
  - Contents value (inventory and estimate)
  - Valuables requiring special coverage (jewelry, art, collectibles)
  - Home business equipment
  - Detached structures
- **Auto:**
  - Vehicle values (determine collision/comp limits)
  - Number of drivers and their records
  - Usage (commute, business, pleasure)
- **Other property:**
  - Boats, RVs, motorcycles (may need separate policies)
  - Rental properties (landlord policy, not homeowners)

**2. Liability Exposures**
- **Premises liability:** Injuries on your property
- **Auto liability:** Injuries/damage you cause while driving
- **Personal liability:** Defamation, discrimination, other personal acts
- **Dog liability:** Breed restrictions, bite history
- **Pool/trampoline:** Attractive nuisance
- **Home business:** Customers/clients visiting, professional services
- **Board service:** Non-profit board liability

**3. Income Protection**
- **Disability insurance:** What if you can't work?
  - Current income
  - Fixed expenses (must-pay bills)
  - Existing coverage (employer, Social Security Disability)
  - Gap = disability insurance need
- **Life insurance:** What if you die?
  - Income replacement need (dependents' living expenses)
  - Debt payoff (mortgage, loans)
  - Education funding (college for kids)
  - Final expenses (funeral, estate costs)
  - Existing coverage (employer, existing policies)
  - Gap = life insurance need

**4. Health Exposures**
- Annual medical costs
- Chronic conditions or foreseeable expenses
- Risk tolerance (high deductible vs. low?)
- Provider network preferences
- Prescription drug needs

**Personal Insurance Recommendations:**

**Homeowners/Renters:**
- **Coverage A (Dwelling):** Replacement cost, not market value (estimate with contractor)
- **Coverage C (Contents):** 50-70% of dwelling coverage (adjust if needed)
- **Replacement Cost on Contents:** Pay extra to avoid depreciation
- **Increased limits:** Jewelry, electronics, art (schedule high-value items)
- **Sewer backup coverage:** Common exclusion, important endorsement
- **Earthquake/Flood:** Separate policies if in risk area
- **Identity theft coverage:** Often available as endorsement
- **Deductible:** 1-2% of coverage A (higher saves premium but increases risk)

**Auto:**
- **Liability:** State minimums are inadequate; recommend 100/300/100 or higher
- **Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist:** Match liability limits
- **Collision/Comprehensive:** Deductible based on savings and vehicle value
  - New car: Low deductible ($250-500)
  - Older car: Higher deductible ($1,000+) or drop coverage if value < $3,000
- **Rental car coverage:** May be redundant with credit card coverage
- **Roadside assistance:** Often cheaper through AAA

**Umbrella:**
- **When needed:** Net worth > $500K or significant liability exposure
- **Coverage:** $1-5M (increments of $1M)
- **Requires underlying limits:** Typically 250/500 auto, 300K home liability
- **Cost:** $200-400/year for $1M (very affordable for protection)

**Life:**
- **Term life:** Most cost-effective for income replacement (10-30 year terms)
- **Amount:** 10-15x annual income or specific needs calculation
- **Permanent life:** Only if estate planning, tax strategy, or lifelong need

**Disability:**
- **Own occupation vs. any occupation:** Own occ better but more expensive
- **Benefit amount:** 60-70% of income (tax-free if you pay premiums)
- **Elimination period:** 90 days typical (longer = lower premium)
- **Benefit period:** To age 65 preferred

**Commercial Risk Assessment:**

**1. Property Exposures**
- Building value (if owned)
- Contents (equipment, inventory, furniture)
- Business income loss (if operations interrupted)
- Extra expense (cost to continue operations during repairs)
- Tenant improvements (if leasing)

**2. Liability Exposures**
- **General liability:** Customer injuries, property damage to others
- **Professional liability:** Errors, omissions, negligence in services
- **Product liability:** Injuries from products you make/sell
- **Cyber liability:** Data breach, privacy violations, cyber extortion
- **Employment practices:** Discrimination, wrongful termination, harassment

**3. Business Interruption**
- Monthly revenue
- Fixed expenses (continue even if closed)
- Seasonal fluctuations
- Time to recover from various scenarios (fire, equipment failure, cyber attack)

**4. Workers' Compensation**
- Number of employees
- Job classifications (risk level)
- Payroll by classification
- **Required in most states** - Heavy penalties for non-compliance

**5. Auto**
- Number of vehicles
- Usage (delivery, service calls, sales)
- Drivers and their records
- Hired and non-owned auto exposure (employees using personal cars for business)

**Commercial Insurance Recommendations:**

**Business Owner's Policy (BOP):**
- Bundles property and general liability
- Good for small to medium businesses
- Typically cheaper than separate policies
- May not cover all exposures (professional liability, cyber)

**General Liability:**
- **Per occurrence limit:** $1M minimum
- **Aggregate limit:** $2M typical
- **Higher limits:** If contractual requirements or high-risk operations

**Professional Liability:**
- **Coverage basis:** Claims-made with retroactive date (understand tail coverage)
- **Limits:** Depends on revenue and risk (common: $1M per claim, $2M aggregate)
- **Deductible:** Often $5K-25K

**Cyber Liability:**
- **First-party:** Your costs (forensics, notification, PR, business interruption)
- **Third-party:** Lawsuits from customers whose data was breached
- **Limits:** $1M-$5M depending on data volume and industry
- **Increasingly important** - Consider even if small business

**Workers' Comp:**
- **Required limits:** Varies by state
- **Experience modification:** Good safety record = lower rates
- **Return-to-work programs:** Reduce costs and claims

**Deliverables:**
- Risk exposure inventory
- Coverage gap analysis
- Insurance program structure (policies, limits, deductibles)
- Cost-benefit analysis of coverage options
- RFP for insurance quotes

### Workflow 4: Insurance Shopping & Comparison

**Purpose:** Obtain competitive quotes and select the best coverage and price combination.

**Shopping Process:**

**Step 1: Prepare Information**
- Current policies (for comparison)
- Property details (address, construction, square footage, age, updates)
- Auto details (VIN, year/make/model, annual mileage)
- Driver information (license numbers, birthdates, violations/accidents)
- Business details (revenue, payroll, operations description, loss history)
- Claims history (last 5 years)

**Step 2: Determine Coverage Needs**
- Desired limits
- Deductible preferences
- Required endorsements or optional coverages
- Bundle opportunities (multi-policy discount)

**Step 3: Obtain Quotes**
- **Options:**
  - Independent agent (represents multiple insurers)
  - Captive agent (represents one insurer - State Farm, Allstate)
  - Direct (online or phone - Geico, Progressive)
  - Broker (commercial insurance, especially)
- **Get 3-5 quotes** for comparison
- Provide identical information to each (apples-to-apples comparison)

**Step 4: Compare Quotes**
**Don't just compare price** - Compare coverage, limits, deductibles, exclusions, insurer quality

**Comparison Matrix:**
| Factor | Company A | Company B | Company C |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Annual Premium | $X | $X | $X |
| Coverage Limits | Detail | Detail | Detail |
| Deductibles | $X | $X | $X |
| Exclusions | List | List | List |
| Endorsements Included | List | List | List |
| Financial Strength | A.M. Best rating | A.M. Best rating | A.M. Best rating |
| Customer Service Reputation | Reviews/ratings | Reviews/ratings | Reviews/ratings |
| Discounts Applied | List | List | List |
| Claim Process Reputation | Research | Research | Research |

**Step 5: Evaluate Insurers**
- **Financial strength:** A.M. Best ratings (A or better preferred)
  - Can they pay claims even in catastrophe?
- **Customer service:** JD Power, Consumer Reports ratings
- **Claims handling:** How do they treat claimants? (Research reviews)
- **Stability:** Will they non-renew or drastically increase rates?

**Step 6: Negotiate**
- Ask about additional discounts:
  - Bundling (auto + home)
  - Security systems, fire alarms
  - Claims-free history
  - Professional affiliations
  - Defensive driving course
  - Good student
  - Pay-in-full
- Adjust deductibles to find sweet spot (premium vs. out-of-pocket risk)
- Ask about loyalty discounts (if staying with current insurer)

**Step 7: Review Before Purchasing**
- Read policy sample (not just quote)
- Verify coverage matches quote
- Check for errors in information (affects premium and coverage)
- Understand cancellation/refund policy
- Know when coverage starts (avoid gaps)

**Red Flags:**
- Quote seems too good to be true (likely is)
- Pushy sales tactics
- Insurer with poor financial rating (below B+)
- Unwillingness to provide policy sample
- Vague answers about coverage
- Require payment before providing policy details

**Money-Saving Strategies:**

**Increase Deductibles:**
- Doubling deductible ($500 → $1,000) saves 10-20% on premium
- Only if you can afford deductible out-of-pocket

**Bundle Policies:**
- Multi-policy discount (15-25% typical)
- Multi-car discount

**Improve Credit Score:**
- Insurance scores heavily weight credit (in most states)
- Better credit = lower rates

**Reduce Coverage on Older Vehicles:**
- Drop collision/comprehensive if value < $3,000

**Ask About Discounts:**
- Professional affiliations (alumni, AAA, professional orgs)
- Home security systems
- Safe driving courses
- Good student (for young drivers)
- Low mileage

**Shop Regularly:**
- Compare quotes every 2-3 years (loyalty doesn't always pay)
- Major life changes (marriage, new home, new car) = shop

**Improve Risk Profile:**
- Home: Update roof, electrical, plumbing
- Auto: Clean driving record
- Business: Safety programs, security measures

**Deliverables:**
- Quote comparison matrix
- Insurer evaluation report
- Coverage recommendations with rationale
- Savings opportunities analysis
- Implementation checklist

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command/Trigger |
|--------|-----------------|

| Insurance comparison | "Compare [policy A] vs [policy B]" |
| Coverage recommendation | "How much [coverage type] do I need for [situation]?" |
| Claim guidance | "Steps to file [claim type]" |
| Deductible analysis | "Should I increase deductible to [amount]?" |
| Insurer evaluation | "Is [insurance company] reputable?" |
| Risk assessment | "What insurance does [business type] need?" |
| Exclusion interpretation | "Does [exclusion] apply to [scenario]?" |

## Best Practices

### Policy Review
- **Read your policy** - Don't wait until claim to discover what's not covered
- **Understand exclusions** - They matter more than coverages
- **Review annually** - Needs change, update coverage accordingly
- **Keep documentation** - Store policies somewhere accessible
- **Know your agent/company** - Contact information, how to file claim

### Claims Management
- **Report promptly** - Delays can void coverage
- **Document everything** - Photos, receipts, correspondence
- **Mitigate damage** - Prevent further loss (duty under policy)
- **Don't admit fault** - Let facts speak, especially in liability claims
- **Keep receipts** - Temporary repairs, living expenses, anything claim-related
- **Be honest** - Fraud can void policy and result in criminal charges

### Coverage Planning
- **Adequate limits** - Better to have too much than too little
- **Don't underinsure property** - Inflation, replacement cost > market value
- **Umbrella is cheap protection** - $1M for $200-400/year
- **Understand actual cash value vs. replacement cost** - RCV costs more but worth it
- **Special limits** - Jewelry, electronics, art need scheduled coverage

### Insurance Shopping
- **Compare apples to apples** - Same limits, deductibles, coverages
- **Evaluate insurer quality** - Cheapest isn't best if they don't pay claims
- **Don't chase lowest price** - Balance cost and coverage
- **Bundle when it makes sense** - But verify bundling actually saves money
- **Review independently** - Agent works for insurer (or commission); verify their advice

### Risk Management
- **Insurance is last resort** - First, avoid and mitigate risks
- **Safety and security** - Prevent losses in first place
- **Loss control** - Fire alarms, security systems, safety training
- **Self-insure small risks** - Use high deductibles for savings
- **Transfer big risks** - Use insurance for catastrophic losses

## Common Insurance Myths

**Myth:** Red cars cost more to insure.
**Reality:** Color doesn't affect rates. Vehicle make/model, value, and safety features do.

**Myth:** Homeowners covers flood damage.
**Reality:** Flood is specifically excluded. Need separate flood policy (NFIP or private).

**Myth:** Comprehensive auto covers everything.
**Reality:** "Comprehensive" just means non-collision damage (theft, vandalism, weather). Not everything.

**Myth:** Credit doesn't affect rates.
**Reality:** Insurance scores (based on credit) heavily influence rates in most states.

**Myth:** Your insurance follows the car.
**Reality:** Usually follows the driver. If you lend your car, your insurance is primary.

**Myth:** Business use of personal auto is covered.
**Reality:** Typically excluded. Need commercial auto or business use endorsement.

**Myth:** Home business is covered by homeowners.
**Reality:** Very limited coverage ($2,500 typical). Need home business or commercial policy.

**Myth:** Earthquake coverage is included.
**Reality:** Specifically excluded in most states. Need separate earthquake policy.

**Final Reminder:** Insurance is a contract. Coverage depends on specific policy language, which varies by insurer and state. This skill provides general education and analytical frameworks, but it is NOT insurance advice or legal counsel. Always work with licensed insurance professionals, read your actual policy documents, and consult attorneys for coverage disputes or legal questions. When in doubt, ask questions before you buy and before you have a claim.
