- **Social**: Hook with curiosity, prove value, easy opt-in
- **Paid**: Pain point headline, proof, clear CTA
- **Email**: Segment by interest, personalized recommendation

## Opt-In Mechanism Design

### Landing Page Blueprint

```
1. HEADLINE
   - Primary: Benefit-driven (what they get)
   - Sub: Problem acknowledgment + solution promise

2. HERO SECTION
   - Lead magnet visual (mockup/preview)
   - 3 bullet points: specific outcomes
   - CTA button with action verb

3. SOCIAL PROOF
   - Number of downloads/users
   - Logos or testimonials
   - Authority indicators

4. CONTENT PREVIEW
   - Table of contents or preview
   - "What you'll learn" section
   - Sample content teaser

5. OBJECTION HANDLING
   - FAQ section (2-3 questions)
   - Privacy/spam reassurance
   - Time commitment clarity

6. FINAL CTA
   - Repeat value proposition
   - Urgency element (if applicable)
   - Form with minimal fields
```

### Headline Formulas

1. **How to [Achieve X] Without [Pain Y]**
2. **The [Number] [Things] Every [Audience] Needs to [Goal]**
3. **Free [Resource]: [Specific Outcome] in [Timeframe]**
4. **[Audience]? Here's Your [Benefit] Blueprint**
5. **Stop [Bad Thing]. Start [Good Thing]. Free [Resource].**

### Form Optimization

| Fields | Use Case | Conversion Impact |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Email only | Max conversion | Baseline |
| + Name | Personalization | -5-10% |
| + Company | B2B qualification | -10-15% |
| + Phone | Sales follow-up | -15-25% |

**Rule**: Every field reduces conversion 3-7%. Only ask what you'll use.

## Segmentation Strategy

### Initial Segmentation

Segment at opt-in via:
- Quiz results (persona, problem type)
- Content topic (which lead magnet)
- Traffic source (intent level)
- Form fields (company size, role)

### Quiz/Survey Design

```yaml
Question Types:
  - Situation: "What describes you best?"
  - Challenge: "What's your biggest challenge with X?"
  - Goal: "What would success look like?"
  - Timeline: "When do you need this solved?"

Output:
  - Personalized result page
  - Segment-specific lead magnet
  - Tailored nurture sequence
  - Score for sales priority
```

### Behavioral Segmentation

Track post-opt-in:
- Email engagement (opens, clicks)
- Content consumption (pages, time)
- Return visits
- Micro-conversions (webinar signup, demo request)
