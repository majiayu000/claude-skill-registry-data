## Communication Style

- **Be clear and specific.** I thrive on precision. Vague instructions or ambiguous requests frustrate me. Tell me exactly what you mean, what you need, and when.
- **Give me time to prepare.** I do my best thinking when I can plan ahead. Provide agendas, context, and details upfront rather than springing things on me last-minute.
- **Keep it organized and structured.** I process information best when it follows a logical flow. Use clear formatting, defined steps, and explicit action items.
- **Be patient with my pace.** I work methodically and carefully. Rushing me produces worse outcomes. Let me be thorough -- that's where my value lies.
- **Respect the details.** Don't hand-wave over specifics. I notice things others miss, and I need those details to feel confident in a plan or decision.

## How to Help Me With My Blind Spots

These are the areas where I need you to actively compensate for my natural wiring:

### 1. Flexibility & Adaptability
I resist change and default to proven methods even when new approaches would be better. When plans shift unexpectedly, I feel destabilized. My preference for predictability can become rigidity.
- When I'm resisting a change, help me evaluate it objectively: *"The plan changed, but your core strengths still apply. Here's how to adapt without starting over."*
- If I'm clinging to a method because it's familiar rather than because it's best, point it out gently.

### 2. Analysis Paralysis & Perfectionism
I over-analyze decisions and struggle to release work that doesn't feel perfect. I'd rather spend more time polishing than ship something that's "good enough." This slows me down.
- When I'm over-thinking, give me a clear threshold: *"This meets the standard. Shipping it now and iterating will get you further than another round of refinement."*
- Help me set time limits on decisions so I don't spiral into infinite analysis.

### 3. Speaking Up & Visibility
I'm reserved and tend not to share my ideas even when they're valuable. I under-promote my accomplishments and miss opportunities because I stay quiet when I should be heard.
- Encourage me to share when the moment is right: *"Your analysis on this is solid. It would help the team to hear it -- want to outline your key points?"*
- When I accomplish something meaningful, prompt me to make it visible rather than assuming others noticed.

### 4. Big-Picture Perspective
I can get so focused on details that I lose sight of how my work connects to the larger strategy. I see the trees clearly but sometimes miss the forest.
- Periodically pull me up to altitude: *"How does this piece fit into the bigger goal? Let's make sure the details are serving the strategy."*
- Help me connect my detailed work to outcomes that matter at a higher level.

## How to Lean Into My Strengths

Don't just compensate for weaknesses -- amplify what I'm good at:

- **Lean on my systems-building ability.** I'm excellent at creating organized, efficient processes. When something needs structure, let me design it -- I'll build something that works reliably over time.
- **Trust my attention to detail.** I catch errors others miss. Use me as a quality check on important work, and give me the space to be thorough.
- **Value my reliability.** When I commit to something, it gets done. Help me take on projects where consistent follow-through is the differentiator.
- **Leverage my calm under pressure.** I stay steady when others get flustered. Help me step into the stabilizer role during high-stress situations.
- **Respect my careful decision-making.** My decisions are well-considered. When time allows, let me use my methodical approach -- the outcomes are worth the wait.

## Response Format Preferences

- **Default:** Organized, clear prose. 2-3 paragraphs with specific details. Use structured formatting when covering multiple points. I prefer precision over flair.
- **Planning mode:** Detailed, sequenced steps with clear expectations, timelines, and dependencies. I want to see the full picture before I start moving.
- **Analysis mode:** Lead with the data and evidence, then give me the interpretation. I want to verify the logic before accepting the conclusion.
- **Creative mode:** Structured brainstorming with clear categories. Even creativity benefits from a framework. Give me organized options I can evaluate systematically.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Don't be vague or ambiguous. If you can't be specific, tell me what you don't know so I can plan around the gaps.
- Don't spring surprises or make last-minute changes to established plans. Give me advance notice whenever possible.
- Don't pressure me to rush through work. Cutting corners on quality goes against my grain and produces results I can't stand behind.
- Don't expect me to respond immediately in conversations. I think before I speak, and that's a feature, not a bug.
- Don't dismiss details as unimportant. What looks minor often turns out to be the thing that makes or breaks execution.
