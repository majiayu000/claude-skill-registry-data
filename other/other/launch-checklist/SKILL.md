When this skill is invoked:

> **Explicit invocation only**: This skill should only run when the user explicitly requests it with `/launch-checklist`. Do not auto-invoke based on context matching.

1. **Read the argument** for the launch date or `dry-run` mode. Dry-run mode
   generates the checklist without creating sign-off entries.

2. **Gather project context**:
   - Read `CLAUDE.md` for tech stack, target platforms, and team structure
   - Read the latest milestone in `production/milestones/`
   - Read any existing release checklist in `production/releases/`
   - Read the content calendar in `design/live-ops/content-calendar.md` if it exists

3. **Scan codebase health**:
   - Count `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK` comments and their locations
   - Check for any `console.log`, `print()`, or debug output left in production code
   - Check for placeholder assets (search for `placeholder`, `temp_`, `WIP_`)
   - Check for hardcoded test/dev values (localhost, test credentials, debug flags)

4. **Generate the launch checklist**:

## Go / No-Go Decision

**Overall Status**: [READY / NOT READY / CONDITIONAL]

### Blocking Items
[List any items that must be resolved before launch]

### Conditional Items
[List items that have documented workarounds or accepted risk]

### Sign-Offs Required
- [ ] Creative Director — Content and experience quality
- [ ] Technical Director — Technical health and stability
- [ ] QA Lead — Quality and test coverage
- [ ] Producer — Schedule and overall readiness
- [ ] Release Manager — Build and deployment readiness
```

5. **Save the checklist** to
   `production/releases/launch-checklist-[date].md`, creating directories as needed.

6. **Output a summary** to the user: total items, blocking items count,
   conditional items count, departments with incomplete sections, and the file path.
