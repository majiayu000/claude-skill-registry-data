|--------|---------|
| **Source** | The Brand Gap (2003), Zag (2006) |
| **Expert** | Marty Neumeier - Director of Transformation at Liquid Agency, author of brand strategy classics |
| **Core Principle** | "A brand is a customer's gut feeling about a product, service, or company. It's not what YOU say it is—it's what THEY say it is." |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

This skill helps you build brands that customers believe have no substitute—charismatic brands that command loyalty and premium pricing.

You'll learn to:

1. **Define what a brand really is** - Beyond logos to gut feelings
2. **Bridge the brand gap** - Connect strategy and creativity
3. **Find your Zag** - Radical differentiation that matters
4. **Create the "Onliness Statement"** - Articulate your unique position
5. **Test brand effectiveness** - Validate with real methods
6. **Grow and protect the brand** - Evolve without losing essence

The result: A brand that people choose, talk about, and believe in.

## Instructions

### What is a Brand?

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              A BRAND IS NOT...                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✗ A logo                                                   │
│  ✗ A corporate identity                                     │
│  ✗ A product                                                │
│  ✗ What you say about yourself                              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              A BRAND IS...                                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ✓ A customer's GUT FEELING about a product, service,       │
│    or company                                               │
│                                                             │
│  "When enough individuals arrive at the same gut feeling,   │
│   a company can be said to have a brand."                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight**: You don't control your brand. You can only influence the associations that form in customers' minds. Your job is to shape that gut feeling through every touchpoint.

### The Brand Gap

The "brand gap" is the distance between business strategy and creative execution.

```
    STRATEGY                                    CREATIVITY
    (Logic)                                     (Magic)
       │                                            │
       │         ┌─────────────────────┐           │
       │         │    THE BRAND GAP    │           │
       └────────→│                     │←──────────┘
                 │  Where brands fail  │
                 │  when one side is   │
                 │  weak               │
                 └─────────────────────┘

    Strong Strategy + Weak Creativity = Logical Nonsense
    Weak Strategy + Strong Creativity = Beautiful Irrelevance
    Strong Strategy + Strong Creativity = CHARISMATIC BRAND

### The Five Disciplines of Branding

| Discipline | Core Question | Purpose |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| **1. Differentiate** | How are we different? | Stand out in the market |
| **2. Collaborate** | Who can help build the brand? | Network to create together |
| **3. Innovate** | How do we stay fresh? | Push creative boundaries |
| **4. Validate** | How do we know it's working? | Test and measure |
| **5. Cultivate** | How do we grow it? | Maintain and evolve |

---

### Discipline 1: Differentiate

**Three Essential Questions:**

1. **Who are you?** (Your identity, values, essence)
2. **What do you do?** (Your offering, category, function)
3. **Why does it matter?** (Your relevance, value, impact)

**The Focus Principle:**

> "The danger is rarely too much focus, but too little. An unfocused brand is so broad it doesn't stand for anything."

| Position | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| #1 in small category | Strong, defensible, profitable |
| #3 in large category | Commoditized, price-pressured |

**Better to be #1 in a niche than #3 in a market.**

---

### The Zag: 17-Checkpoint Process

Neumeier's systematic approach to radical differentiation:

**Finding Your Identity (1-5)**

| # | Checkpoint | Question |
|---|------------|----------|
| 1 | Purpose | Who are you? What's your passion, mission, energy? |
| 2 | Core | What do you do? (12 words or less) |
| 3 | Vision | What's your picture of the future? |
| 4 | Trend | What wave are you riding? |
| 5 | Landscape | Who shares the brandscape? |

**Creating Differentiation (6-10)**

| # | Checkpoint | Question |
|---|------------|----------|
| 6 | Onliness | What makes you the "only"? |
| 7 | Focus | What should you add or subtract? |
| 8 | Community | Who loves you? |
| 9 | Enemy | Who's the enemy? |
| 10 | Name | What do they call you? |

**Building Communication (11-15)**

| # | Checkpoint | Question |
|---|------------|----------|
| 11 | Trueline | How do you explain yourself? |
| 12 | Spread | How do you spread the word? |
| 13 | Engagement | How do people engage with you? |
| 14 | Experience | What do they experience? |
| 15 | Loyalty | How do you earn their loyalty? |

**Growing the Brand (16-17)**

| # | Checkpoint | Question |
|---|------------|----------|
| 16 | Extension | How do you extend your success? |
| 17 | Portfolio | How do you protect your portfolio? |

---

### The Onliness Statement

The litmus test for true differentiation. If you can't complete this, you don't have a zag.

**Basic Format:**
> "Our [offering] is the only [category] that [benefit]."

**Extended Framework:**

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **WHAT** is your category? | |
| **HOW** are you different? | |
| **WHO** are your customers? | |
| **WHERE** are they located? | |
| **WHEN** do they need you? | |
| **WHY** are you important? | |

**Example - Harley Davidson:**
> "The only motorcycle manufacturer that makes big, loud motorcycles for macho men (and macho wannabes) mostly in the US who want to join a gang of cowboys at a time of decreased personal freedom."

---

### Trueline vs. Tagline

| Concept | Purpose | Audience | Characteristics |
|---------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Trueline** | Internal positioning | Internal teams | Cannot be refuted, what competitors can't claim |
| **Tagline** | External expression | Customers | Sexy, memorable, marketing-friendly |

**Examples:**

| Brand | Trueline (Internal) | Tagline (External) |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Southwest Airlines | "You can fly anywhere for less than it costs to drive" | "You are now free to move about the country" |
| ChapStick | "The secret to healthy lips in extreme weather" | "My lips are sealed" |
| Nike | "Helps you find your inner athlete" | "Just do it" |
| Disneyland | "The world's favorite amusement park" | "The happiest place on Earth" |

---

### Discipline 3: Innovate

**The 7 Criteria for a Good Brand Name:**

| # | Criterion | Test Question |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Distinctiveness** | Does it stand out from the category crowd? |
| 2 | **Brevity** | Is it 4 syllables or less? Will it resist nicknames? |
| 3 | **Appropriateness** | Does it fit the business without being generic? |
| 4 | **Spelling/Pronunciation** | Can people spell it after hearing it? Say it after reading it? |
| 5 | **Likability** | Does it feel and sound good to say? |
| 6 | **Extendibility** | Does it have legs for creative execution? |
| 7 | **Protectability** | Can it be trademarked? Is the .com available? |

**High Imagery vs. Low Imagery Names:**

| Type | Origin | Examples | Effect |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| High Imagery | Anglo-Saxon | Apple, Amazon, Shell, Virgin | More memorable, visual |
| Low Imagery | Greek/Latin | Accenture, Agilent, Lexus | More sophisticated, less distinct |

---

### Discipline 4: Validate

**Four Brand Tests:**

**1. The Swap Test**
Swap part of your icon (name or visual) with a competitor's.
- If result is better or same → You have room to improve
- If result is clearly worse → You're differentiated

**2. The Hand Test**
Cover your logo on any marketing material.
- Can you still tell it's yours? → Strong identity
- Could it be anyone's? → Weak identity

**3. The Concept Test**
Test with 10+ real audience members:
- "Which of these promises is most valuable to you?"
- "Which company would you expect to make this promise?"
- "If company X made this promise, would that make sense?"

**4. The Field Test**
Put prototypes in real environments:
- Packaging on real shelves
- Website among real competitors
- Ads in real media contexts

**Five Elements to Test:**

| Element | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **Distinctiveness** | Does it stand out from competing messages? |
| **Relevance** | Is it appropriate for the brand's goals? |
| **Memorability** | Can people recall it when needed? |
| **Extendibility** | Will it work across media and cultures? |
| **Depth** | Does it communicate on multiple levels? |

---

### Discipline 5: Cultivate

Brands are living things that need ongoing care.

**Brand Education Principles:**
- Start with onboarding—every new hire learns the brand
- Continue without finish line—regular reinforcement
- Prevent "evaporation"—wisdom leaving with departing staff

> "The secret of a living brand is that it lives throughout the company, not just in the marketing department."

---

### Portfolio Strategy

**Two Models (Choose One):**

| Model | Structure | Example | Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **House of Brands** | Separate brands for each product | P&G (Tide, Pampers, Gillette) | Individual positioning | Separate marketing budgets |
| **Branded House** | Company is brand, products are subsets | Apple (iPhone, Mac, iPad) | Shared brand equity | One-size-fits-all |

**Warning**: Never mix models. Hybrid approaches create confusion.

**Four Portfolio Risks:**

1. **Contagion**: One brand's crisis infects others
2. **Confusion**: Extending past customer-defined boundaries
3. **Contradiction**: Different cultural interpretations
4. **Complexity**: Overgrown, unmanageable portfolio

---

## Examples

### Example 1: B2B Software Company Rebrand

**Situation**: A project management software company is lost among dozens of similar tools. They compete on features but keep losing deals to larger competitors.

**Applying the Framework:**

**Three Questions:**
- Who are you? "We're the team that believes work should be visible"
- What do you do? "Project management software"
- Why does it matter? "When work is visible, accountability follows naturally"

**Onliness Statement:**
> "Our software is the only project management tool that makes all work visible across the entire organization in real-time."

**Zag Identification:**
| Competitor Approach | Our Zag |
|---------------------|---------|
| Feature-rich | Radically simple |
| Team-focused | Organization-wide |
| Dashboard-heavy | Feed-based (like social) |
| Closed ecosystem | Open integrations |

**Trueline**: "The only way to see all your company's work in one place"

**Tagline**: "See everything. Miss nothing."

**Name Evaluation (current: "ProjectFlow")**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Distinctiveness | 3/10 | Generic, many similar names |
| Brevity | 7/10 | 3 syllables |
| Appropriateness | 5/10 | Describes category, not difference |
| Pronunciation | 8/10 | Easy |
| Likability | 5/10 | Neutral |
| Extendibility | 4/10 | Limited creative options |
| Protectability | 4/10 | Likely trademark issues |

**Recommended New Name Options:**
- "Beacon" (high imagery, suggests visibility)
- "Clearview" (direct, functional)
- "Daylight" (metaphorical, memorable)

---

### Example 2: Local Bakery Brand Development

**Situation**: A new artisan bakery opening in a neighborhood with several established bakeries.

**Three Questions:**
- Who are you? "We're obsessed with fermentation and slow processes"
- What do you do? "Artisan bread and pastries"
- Why does it matter? "Real bread takes time. Fast bread isn't bread."

**Onliness Statement:**
> "The only bakery that never rushes—every product fermented for minimum 24 hours."

**Enemy Definition**: Industrial bread, fast-rising dough, shortcuts

**Brand Tests:**

**Swap Test**: If we put our bread in a competitor's packaging, would customers notice?
- Yes—our bread looks and feels different (more rustic, irregular shapes)

**Hand Test**: Remove our name from marketing. Still recognizable?
- Need stronger visual identity (propose: raw, unfinished aesthetic)

**Trueline**: "We never rush. Neither should you."

**Tagline**: "Good things take time."

**Name Options Evaluated:**

| Name | D | B | A | S | L | E | P | Total |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-------|
| "SlowRise" | 7 | 7 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 8 | 7 | 53 |
| "24 Hour" | 6 | 8 | 8 | 9 | 6 | 5 | 5 | 47 |
| "Ferment" | 8 | 7 | 7 | 6 | 6 | 7 | 7 | 48 |

**Winner**: "SlowRise Bakery"
