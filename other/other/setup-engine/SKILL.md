When this skill is invoked:

## 1. Parse Arguments

Three modes:

- **Full spec**: `/setup-engine godot 4.6` — engine and version provided
- **Engine only**: `/setup-engine unity` — engine provided, version will be looked up
- **No args**: `/setup-engine` — fully guided mode (engine recommendation + version)

---

## 2. Guided Mode (No Arguments)

If no engine is specified, run an interactive engine selection process:

### Check for existing game concept
- Read `design/gdd/game-concept.md` if it exists — extract genre, scope, platform
  targets, art style, team size, and any engine recommendation from `/brainstorm`
- If no concept exists, inform the user:
  > "No game concept found. Consider running `/brainstorm` first to discover what
  > you want to build — it will also recommend an engine. Or tell me about your
  > game and I can help you pick."

### If the user wants to pick without a concept, ask:
1. **What kind of game?** (2D, 3D, or both?)
2. **What platforms?** (PC, mobile, console, web?)
3. **Team size and experience?** (solo beginner, solo experienced, small team?)
4. **Any strong language preferences?** (GDScript, C#, C++, visual scripting?)
5. **Budget for engine licensing?** (free only, or commercial licenses OK?)

### Produce a recommendation

Use this decision matrix:

| Factor | Godot 4 | Unity | Unreal Engine 5 |
|--------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Best for** | 2D games, small 3D, solo/small teams | Mobile, mid-scope 3D, cross-platform | AAA 3D, photorealism, large teams |
| **Language** | GDScript (+ C#, C++ via extensions) | C# | C++ / Blueprint |
| **Cost** | Free, MIT license | Free under revenue threshold | Free under revenue threshold, 5% royalty |
| **Learning curve** | Gentle | Moderate | Steep |
| **2D support** | Excellent (native) | Good (but 3D-first engine) | Possible but not ideal |
| **3D quality ceiling** | Good (improving rapidly) | Very good | Best-in-class |
| **Web export** | Yes (native) | Yes (limited) | No |
| **Console export** | Via third-party | Yes (with license) | Yes |
| **Open source** | Yes | No | Source available |

Present the top 1-2 recommendations with reasoning tied to the user's answers.
Let the user choose — never force a recommendation.

---

## 3. Look Up Current Version

Once the engine is chosen:

- If version was provided, use it
- If no version provided, use WebSearch to find the latest stable release:
  - Search: `"[engine] latest stable version [current year]"`
  - Confirm with the user: "The latest stable [engine] is [version]. Use this?"

---

## 4. Update CLAUDE.md Technology Stack

Read `CLAUDE.md` and update the Technology Stack section. Replace the
`[CHOOSE]` placeholders with the actual values:

**For Godot:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Godot [version]
- **Language**: GDScript (primary), C++ via GDExtension (performance-critical)
- **Build System**: SCons (engine), Godot Export Templates
- **Asset Pipeline**: Godot Import System + custom resource pipeline
```

**For Unity:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Unity [version]
- **Language**: C#
- **Build System**: Unity Build Pipeline
- **Asset Pipeline**: Unity Asset Import Pipeline + Addressables
```

**For Unreal:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Unreal Engine [version]
- **Language**: C++ (primary), Blueprint (gameplay prototyping)
- **Build System**: Unreal Build Tool (UBT)
- **Asset Pipeline**: Unreal Content Pipeline
```

---

## 5. Populate Technical Preferences

After updating CLAUDE.md, create or update `.claude/docs/technical-preferences.md` with
engine-appropriate defaults. Read the existing template first, then fill in:

### Engine & Language Section
- Fill from the engine choice made in step 4

### Naming Conventions (engine defaults)

**For Godot (GDScript):**
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- Variables/functions: snake_case (e.g., `move_speed`)
- Signals: snake_case past tense (e.g., `health_changed`)
- Files: snake_case matching class (e.g., `player_controller.gd`)
- Scenes: PascalCase matching root node (e.g., `PlayerController.tscn`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)

**For Unity (C#):**
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- Public fields/properties: PascalCase (e.g., `MoveSpeed`)
- Private fields: _camelCase (e.g., `_moveSpeed`)
- Methods: PascalCase (e.g., `TakeDamage()`)
- Files: PascalCase matching class (e.g., `PlayerController.cs`)
- Constants: PascalCase or UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

**For Unreal (C++):**
- Classes: Prefixed PascalCase (`A` for Actor, `U` for UObject, `F` for struct)
- Variables: PascalCase (e.g., `MoveSpeed`)
- Functions: PascalCase (e.g., `TakeDamage()`)
- Booleans: `b` prefix (e.g., `bIsAlive`)
- Files: Match class without prefix (e.g., `PlayerController.h`)

### Remaining Sections
- Performance Budgets: Leave as `[TO BE CONFIGURED]` with a suggestion:
  > "Typical targets: 60fps / 16.6ms frame budget. Want to set these now?"
- Testing: Suggest engine-appropriate framework (GUT for Godot, NUnit for Unity, etc.)
- Forbidden Patterns / Allowed Libraries: Leave as placeholder

### Collaborative Step
Present the filled-in preferences to the user:
> "Here are the default technical preferences for [engine]. Want to customize
> any of these, or shall I save the defaults?"

Wait for approval before writing the file.

## 6. Determine Knowledge Gap

Check whether the engine version is likely beyond the LLM's training data.

**Known approximate coverage** (update this as models change):
- LLM knowledge cutoff: **May 2025**
- Godot: training data likely covers up to ~4.3
- Unity: training data likely covers up to ~2023.x / early 6000.x
- Unreal: training data likely covers up to ~5.3 / early 5.4

Compare the user's chosen version against these baselines:

- **Within training data** → `LOW RISK` — reference docs optional but recommended
- **Near the edge** → `MEDIUM RISK` — reference docs recommended
- **Beyond training data** → `HIGH RISK` — reference docs required

Inform the user which category they're in and why.

---

## 7. Populate Engine Reference Docs

### If WITHIN training data (LOW RISK):

Create a minimal `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`:

```markdown
# [Engine] — Version Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Engine Version** | [version] |
| **Project Pinned** | [today's date] |
| **LLM Knowledge Cutoff** | May 2025 |
| **Risk Level** | LOW — version is within LLM training data |

## Note

This engine version is within the LLM's training data. Engine reference
docs are optional but can be added later if agents suggest incorrect APIs.

Run `/setup-engine refresh` to populate full reference docs at any time.
```

Do NOT create breaking-changes.md, deprecated-apis.md, etc. — they would
add context cost with minimal value.

### If BEYOND training data (MEDIUM or HIGH RISK):

Create the full reference doc set by searching the web:

1. **Search for the official migration/upgrade guide**:
   - `"[engine] [old version] to [new version] migration guide"`
   - `"[engine] [version] breaking changes"`
   - `"[engine] [version] changelog"`
   - `"[engine] [version] deprecated API"`

2. **Fetch and extract** from official documentation:
   - Breaking changes between each version from the training cutoff to current
   - Deprecated APIs with replacements
   - New features and best practices

3. **Create the full reference directory**:
   ```
   docs/engine-reference/<engine>/
   ├── VERSION.md              # Version pin + knowledge gap analysis
   ├── breaking-changes.md     # Version-by-version breaking changes
   ├── deprecated-apis.md      # "Don't use X → Use Y" tables
   ├── current-best-practices.md  # New practices since training cutoff
   └── modules/                # Per-subsystem references (create as needed)
   ```

4. **Populate each file** using real data from the web searches, following
   the format established in existing reference docs. Every file must have
   a "Last verified: [date]" header.

5. **For module files**: Only create modules for subsystems where significant
   changes occurred. Don't create empty or minimal module files.

---

## 8. Update CLAUDE.md Import

Update the `@` import under "Engine Version Reference" to point to the
correct engine:

```markdown
## Engine Version Reference

@docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md
```

If the previous import pointed to a different engine (e.g., switching from
Godot to Unity), update it.

---

## 9. Update Agent Instructions

For the chosen engine's specialist agents, verify they have a
"Version Awareness" section. If not, add one following the pattern in
the existing Godot specialist agents.

The section should instruct the agent to:
1. Read `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`
2. Check deprecated APIs before suggesting code
3. Check breaking changes for relevant version transitions
4. Use WebSearch to verify uncertain APIs

---

## 10. Refresh Subcommand

If invoked as `/setup-engine refresh`:

1. Read the existing `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md` to get
   the current engine and version
2. Use WebSearch to check for:
   - New engine releases since last verification
   - Updated migration guides
   - Newly deprecated APIs
3. Update all reference docs with new findings
4. Update "Last verified" dates on all modified files
5. Report what changed

---

## 11. Output Summary

After setup is complete, output:

```
Engine Setup Complete
=====================
Engine:          [name] [version]
Knowledge Risk:  [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]
Reference Docs:  [created/skipped]
CLAUDE.md:       [updated]
Tech Prefs:      [created/updated]
Agent Config:    [verified]

Next Steps:
1. Review docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md
2. [If from /brainstorm] Run /prototype [core-mechanic] to test the core loop
3. [If fresh start] Run /brainstorm to discover your game concept
4. Create your first milestone: /sprint-plan new
```

---

## Guardrails

- NEVER guess an engine version — always verify via WebSearch or user confirmation
- NEVER overwrite existing reference docs without asking — append or update
- If reference docs already exist for a different engine, ask before replacing
- Always show the user what you're about to change before making CLAUDE.md edits
- If WebSearch returns ambiguous results, show the user and let them decide
