# Conversion Copywriting - Data-Driven Copy That Converts

> Write copy that gets a "yes" using Joanna Wiebe's research-first, Voice of Customer methodology

## When to Use This Skill

- **Writing landing pages, emails, or sales pages** that need measurable conversion results
- **Starting a new copy project** and need a systematic process to follow
- **Struggling with what to write** and staring at a blank page
- **Wanting to prove ROI** to clients with data-backed decisions
- **Improving existing copy** through validation and testing
- **Training yourself or your team** on professional copywriting methodology

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Copyhackers, Copy School |
| **Expert** | Joanna Wiebe - Creator of the term "conversion copywriting," founder of Copyhackers |
| **Core Principle** | "Conversion copywriting is data-driven copy that gets prospects to say yes. It's a science-based process that determines what to write and how to write it." |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

This skill transforms copywriting from a guessing game into a systematic, data-driven process. Instead of staring at a blank page and hoping inspiration strikes, you'll:

1. **Research first** - Find your messages in customer language, not your imagination
2. **Listen more than write** - Let Voice of Customer (VOC) data do the heavy lifting
3. **Validate before launching** - Test copy before committing fully
4. **Measure everything** - Know what's working and why

The result: Copy that converts because it says what customers actually want to hear, in the words they already use.

## How to Use

### Prompt Examples

```
Guide me through the conversion copywriting process for my [landing page/email/sales page].
Start with research questions I should answer before writing.
```

```
Help me extract Voice of Customer data from these customer reviews for my [product].
Identify the strongest messages and organize them into a hierarchy.
```

```
I have this VOC data: [paste data]. Turn it into copy for a [page type]
using the Copyhackers methodology.
```

```
Create a wireframe outline for my [landing page] that organizes these messages:
[list messages]. Include awareness stage transitions and CTA placement.
```

```
Run the 7 Sweeps editing process on this copy: [paste copy].
Start with the Clarity Sweep and work through all seven.
```

## Instructions

### The 3-Part Process Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. RESEARCH & DISCOVERY  │  2. WRITE, WIREFRAME, EDIT  │  3. VALIDATE & TEST  │
│      (Biggest phase)      │      (Synthesis phase)      │   (Proof phase)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

No phase is optional. Even if a client says "just write," you still need research.

### Part 1: Research & Discovery

> "If research is not the biggest part of the work, 99% of the time it means you're doing it wrong."

**Goal**: Find your messages in customer language—don't invent them.

#### Research Checklist

**Internal Sources:**
- [ ] Existing website copy audit
- [ ] Product pages and feature descriptions
- [ ] Sales call transcripts/recordings
- [ ] Customer support tickets
- [ ] Chat transcripts
- [ ] Email sequences currently in use
- [ ] Brochures and sales materials

**Customer Sources:**
- [ ] Customer surveys (existing or new)
- [ ] Thank-you page polls
- [ ] Customer interviews (transcribed)
- [ ] Review mining (Amazon, G2, Capterra, Trustpilot)
- [ ] Social media comments and discussions
- [ ] Forum posts and Reddit threads
- [ ] Testimonials and case studies

**Competitive Sources:**
- [ ] Competitor website audits
- [ ] Competitor reviews (especially negative ones)
- [ ] Industry forums and discussions

**Analytics Sources:**
- [ ] Click tracking data
- [ ] Heatmaps and scroll maps
- [ ] Conversion funnel analysis
- [ ] Exit survey data

#### How to Mine VOC Data

**What to look for:**

1. **Pain language** - How do they describe their problem?
2. **Desire language** - What outcome do they want?
3. **Objection language** - What's stopping them?
4. **Trigger language** - What made them start looking?
5. **Value language** - What benefits matter most?
6. **Emotional language** - How do they feel about all of the above?

**How to organize:**
- Tag each insight by type (pain, desire, objection, etc.)
- Note the source and frequency
- Identify patterns and repeating themes
- Rank by strength/emotion

### Part 2: Writing, Wireframing & Editing

#### The Writing Setup

**Joanna's Split-Screen Method:**

1. Open research/VOC data on LEFT side of screen
2. Open writing document on RIGHT side
3. Search VOC data for relevant keywords
4. Copy-paste actual customer language
5. Refine into copy (don't reinvent)

> "You don't sit there and just start writing. Split your screen in two and take what people are saying and put it on the page."

#### The Writing Process

**Step 1: Determine Awareness Stage**

Where is your reader starting?

| Stage | They Know | Example Headline Approach |
|-------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Unaware | Nothing | Lead with the problem/pain |
| Problem-Aware | They have a problem | Agitate the problem |
| Solution-Aware | Solutions exist | Differentiate your solution |
| Product-Aware | Your product exists | Prove you're the best choice |
| Most Aware | Ready to buy | Make the offer irresistible |

**Step 2: Map Your Messaging Hierarchy**

What messages need to appear, and in what order?

1. **Primary Message** - The one thing they must understand
2. **Supporting Messages** - Evidence that backs up the primary
3. **Objection Handlers** - Address what's holding them back
4. **Call to Action** - The specific next step

**Step 3: Select Your Framework**

| Framework | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve) | Short copy, high problem-awareness |
| AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action) | Longer sales pages |
| PPPP (Picture-Promise-Prove-Push) | Visual products |
| PASOP (Problem-Agitate-Solution-Outcome-Proof) | Complex solutions |

**Step 4: Draft Using VOC**

Take raw VOC and transform:

**Raw VOC:**
> "I was so frustrated with spreadsheets. Every month I'd spend 8 hours just reconciling data and I'd still find errors."

**Transformed into Copy:**
> "Tired of losing 8+ hours every month to spreadsheet reconciliation—only to find errors anyway?"

#### The 7 Sweeps Editing Process

After your first draft, run these sweeps in order:

| Sweep | Focus | Key Question |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **1. Clarity** | Is it clear? | Would a 12-year-old understand? |
| **2. Voice** | Does it sound right? | Is this how the brand/customer talks? |
| **3. Proof** | Is it believable? | Where's the evidence? |
| **4. Specificity** | Is it specific? | Can I add numbers, names, details? |
| **5. Stickiness** | Is it memorable? | Will they remember this tomorrow? |
| **6. Emotion** | Does it make them feel? | Where's the emotional hook? |
| **7. Zero** | What can I cut? | Does every word earn its place? |

**Clarity is ALWAYS first.** Above everything else, copy must be clear.

#### Wireframing

Create a visual layout showing:
- Where each message block goes
- Image/video placeholders with notes
- CTA placement and copy
- Mobile considerations

Tools: Figma, Balsamiq, Photoshop, or even Google Docs with boxes

---

### Part 3: Validation & Experimentation

> "We test to validate and learn."

**Goal**: Ensure you're putting the best version out before committing.

#### Validation Methods

| Method | Best For | What It Tells You |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **5 Second Test** | Headlines, hero sections | Clarity (not persuasion) |
| **UserTesting** | Full page experience | Usability, comprehension |
| **Wynter** | B2B messaging | Message resonance |
| **Preview Emails** | Email copy | Open/click behavior |
| **Scroll/Click Maps** | Soft launch | Engagement patterns |

#### A/B Testing When Possible

Test one variable at a time:
- Headlines
- CTAs
- Lead image
- Offer structure
- Social proof placement

**Note**: You can't A/B test everything. Validation fills the gaps.

## Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Landing Page Process

**Research Phase (Week 1):**
- Interviewed 5 customers
- Mined 50 G2 reviews
- Analyzed 10 competitor pages
- Reviewed 20 support tickets

**Key VOC Finding:**
> "I was drowning in Slack notifications. By the time I found the message I needed, I'd lost 20 minutes and my train of thought."

**Messaging Hierarchy:**
1. Primary: "Find any message in seconds, not minutes"
2. Supporting: AI-powered search across all channels
3. Objection Handler: "Works with your existing Slack—no migration"
4. CTA: "Start free trial"

**Draft Headline:**
> "Stop drowning in Slack. Find any message in seconds."

**After 7 Sweeps:**
> "Find any Slack message in 3 seconds. Not 20 minutes."
> (Added specificity, cut unnecessary words)

**Validation:**
- 5 Second Test: 85% understood the value prop
- A/B tested against control: +34% signups

---

### Example 2: Email Sequence for Course Launch

**VOC from Survey:**
> "I keep signing up for courses but never finish them. I feel guilty every time I see another one in my inbox."

**Email 1 Subject (Problem-Aware):**
> "That course you never finished? Not your fault."

**Email 1 Opening:**
> "You've bought courses before. Started strong. Then... nothing.
>
> The guilt sits there in your inbox. Every email from that course creator feels like a reminder of another thing you didn't follow through on.
>
> Here's the thing: It's not a willpower problem."

**Transformation Notes:**
- Used exact phrase "never finish"
- Captured the "guilt" emotion from VOC
- Moved from Problem → Solution setup
