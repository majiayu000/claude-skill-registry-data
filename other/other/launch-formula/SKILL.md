# Product Launch Formula - Launch Event Mastery

> Turn your marketing into an event that makes people beg to buy before you even release the product

## When to Use This Skill

- **Launching a new product or course** and want to maximize first-day sales
- **Building anticipation** for an upcoming offer instead of "surprise" launching
- **Growing your email list** while simultaneously warming them up to buy
- **Creating urgency without being sleazy** with legitimate scarcity
- **Turning skeptics into buyers** through sequenced value delivery
- **Relaunching an existing product** to generate new excitement

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Launch (2014) + Product Launch Formula Course |
| **Expert** | Jeff Walker - Generated $1M+ in a single day, students have made $1B+ |
| **Core Principle** | "Give first and ask for the sale later" - deliver so much value during prelaunch that making the sale is almost an afterthought |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures video workflow | Final creative vision |
| Suggests shot compositions | Equipment selection |
| Creates storyboard templates | Brand aesthetics |
| Generates script frameworks | Final approval |
| Identifies technical requirements | Budget allocation |

## What This Skill Does

This skill replaces the traditional "long sales page" approach with a **Sideways Sales Letter** - spreading your sales message across a sequence of valuable content delivered over 7-10 days.

Instead of one moment of decision, you create:
1. **Multiple touchpoints** building relationship and trust
2. **Anticipation** that makes people excited for your offer
3. **Social proof** as others engage publicly
4. **An event** that people want to be part of
5. **Natural urgency** from a real open/close cart window

The result: 50% of sales typically happen on the LAST day of your launch, from an audience primed and ready to buy.

## How to Use

### Prompt Examples

```
Plan a complete product launch sequence for my [product] targeting [audience].
Include pre-prelaunch, 3 PLC videos, and cart open/close email sequence.
```

```
Write the Prelaunch Content outline for PLC 1 (The Opportunity) for my
[course/product] that teaches [transformation].
```

```
Create the Cart Close Day email sequence (4 emails) for my [product]
using Jeff Walker's PLF urgency framework.
```

```
Design a Seed Launch strategy for validating my [product idea] with a
small audience before building the full course.
```

```
Map out the 9 Mental Triggers for my [product launch] - show me how to
incorporate each one throughout the sequence.
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Pre-Prelaunch (1-2 Weeks Before)

**Purpose**: Build anticipation and buzz before revealing anything.

**Actions:**
1. Warm up your audience with "sneak peeks"
2. Let them know something awesome is coming
3. Ask for feedback: "What TWO questions do you have about [topic]?"
4. Get them invested - they help shape the product

**Example Email:**
> Subject: Something big is coming...
>
> I've been working on something for the past 3 months.
>
> It's not quite ready yet, but I wanted to give you a heads up because
> you've been with me for a while.
>
> Before I finalize it, I need your help. What are your TWO biggest
> questions about [topic]?
>
> Hit reply and let me know - I'll make sure to address them.

**Hollywood Parallel**: This is when trailers are released and actors appear on talk shows.

---

### Step 2: Prelaunch - The Sideways Sales Letter (7-10 Days)

Release 3 pieces of Prelaunch Content (PLC) that deliver massive value while building toward your offer.

#### PLC 1 - The Opportunity (Days 1-3)

**Answer**: "What's possible?"

**Structure:**
1. **The Problem** - What's frustrating them right now?
2. **The Solution** - What did you discover?
3. **Your Story** - How did you discover it?
4. **The Opportunity** - What's now possible for them?
5. **Tie to Pain/Desire** - Connect to what they want most

**Mental Triggers**: Authority, Anticipation, Reciprocity

**Example Hook:**
> "In the next 20 minutes, I'm going to show you the exact system that took
> me from $0 to $127,000 in my first launch - and why everything you've been
> told about [topic] is holding you back."

#### PLC 2 - The Transformation (Days 4-6)

**Answer**: "Why should I believe it's possible for ME?"

**Structure:**
1. Bring focus back to THEM
2. Share case studies, testimonials, success stories
3. Walk through ONE aspect of your process in depth
4. Get them doing exercises and engaging
5. Show what transformation FEELS like

**Mental Triggers**: Social Proof, Trust, Community

**Example:**
> "Meet Sarah. She was exactly where you are 6 months ago - overwhelmed,
> skeptical, and honestly pretty tired of 'gurus' making big promises.
> Here's what changed for her..."

#### PLC 3 - The Ownership Experience (Days 7-10)

**Answer**: "How will it feel to own this mastery?"

**Structure:**
1. Paint the picture of their future
2. Give them a taste of the full experience
3. Sow seeds that an offer is coming
4. Let them know you can help them even more
5. Create anticipation for the Open Cart

**Mental Triggers**: Anticipation (peak), Likeability, Events

**Transition to Offer:**
> "You've now seen what's possible, you've seen others do it, and you've
> gotten a taste of the process. Tomorrow, I'm going to show you how I can
> help you get there faster than you ever thought possible."

---

### Step 3: Open Cart (5-7 Days)

**Purpose**: Release tension, open doors, make sales.

**Key Principle**: Cart is only open for LIMITED time (5-7 days maximum).

**Daily Email Strategy:**

| Day | Focus | # Emails |
|-----|-------|----------|
| 1 | "The doors are open!" + excitement | 2 |
| 2 | Case study - transformation story | 1 |
| 3 | FAQ - handle objections | 1 |
| 4 | "Closing tomorrow!" + bonus announcement | 1 |
| 5 | Cart Close Day (see Step 4) | 3-4 |

**Day 1 Emails:**
1. **Morning**: Announcement - the program is now available
2. **Evening**: Early bird results - "Already X people enrolled!"

**Important**: Don't be afraid to sell. You're being honest about deadlines.

---

### Step 4: Cart Close Day (THE Big Day)

**The Big Day**: Typically 50% of sales happen on the LAST day.

**Email Sequence:**

| Time | Email | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Morning | Simple reminder | "Deadline is tonight at midnight" |
| Midday | Story-based | Why they want it, how they'll feel missing out |
| Evening | "Now or never" | Short, direct, deadline emphasis |
| 1hr before | "LAST CHANCE" | Final push (optional but powerful) |

**Morning Email Example:**
> Subject: [CLOSING TONIGHT] Last chance for [Product]
>
> Quick reminder: The doors close tonight at midnight.
>
> Once they close, you won't be able to get [Product] at this price
> (or possibly at all) for at least another year.
>
> [Link to join]
>
> This is your last chance.

**Final Hour Email Example:**
> Subject: 1 HOUR LEFT
>
> In 60 minutes, this page goes away: [Link]
>
> If you've been on the fence, now is the time to decide.
>
> I'll see you on the inside - or I'll see you next year.
>
> [Name]

- Walk through: Exact process for golden hour portraits
- Exercise: "Try this with your phone today and post in the comments"

**PLC 3 - The Ownership Experience:**
- Paint picture: "Imagine never hesitating to share your photos again"
- Preview: Show inside the course platform
- Seed: "Tomorrow I'll show you how to access the complete system"

**Cart Close Emails:**
1. 8am: "Doors close tonight - here's what's inside"
2. 2pm: Student testimonial video

## Launch Types Reference

| Type | When to Use | Scale |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Seed Launch** | Validating a new idea | Small list, low expectations |
| **Internal Launch** | Launching to your own list | Standard PLF approach |
| **JV Launch** | Partnering with others | Massive reach, revenue share |
| **Evergreen Launch** | Automating a proven launch | Runs continuously |

### Seed Launch (For New Products)

Perfect for validating before building:
1. Survey your small audience
2. Pre-sell based on their responses
3. Build the product WITH early buyers
4. Use their results for future launches

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Launching without prelaunch** - Going straight to "buy now"
2. **Too much content at once** - Sequence and stagger for impact
3. **Not collecting feedback** - Pre-prelaunch questions increase engagement
4. **Fear of selling** - Being apologetic about your offer
5. **Fake scarcity** - Destroys trust forever
6. **Ignoring close day** - Most sales happen on the last day
7. **One email per day max during close** - Send 3-4 on close day
8. **No stories** - Facts don't sell, stories do
9. **Skipping mental triggers** - Each piece should hit multiple triggers
10. **Not asking "what's in it for them"** - Always customer-focused
