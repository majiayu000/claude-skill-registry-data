# YC Pitch Deck

> Create a compelling startup pitch deck that follows the structure proven to raise billions from top investors. Master the YC and Sequoia formats that get founders funded.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Fundraising** to create investor pitch decks
- **YC application** to structure your narrative
- **Demo Day prep** to craft your 2-minute pitch
- **Angel investors** to communicate your opportunity
- **Partnership pitches** to structure compelling asks
- **Internal alignment** to articulate your strategy clearly

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | YC (Y Combinator), Sequoia Capital pitch framework |
| **Core Principle** | "The best pitch decks tell a story: Problem → Solution → Why Now → Why You. Every slide must earn its place." |
| **Why This Matters** | Investors see thousands of decks. You have 3 minutes of attention. A great deck doesn't get you funded—a bad deck gets you rejected. |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures video workflow | Final creative vision |
| Suggests shot compositions | Equipment selection |
| Creates storyboard templates | Brand aesthetics |
| Generates script frameworks | Final approval |
| Identifies technical requirements | Budget allocation |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Structures your narrative** - Proven slide sequence that works
2. **Crafts compelling slides** - What goes on each slide
3. **Identifies what to include/exclude** - Signal vs. noise
4. **Tailors for stage** - Pre-seed vs. Seed vs. Series A
5. **Prepares you for Q&A** - What investors will ask
6. **Provides templates** - Starting points for each slide

## How to Use

### Create a Pitch Deck from Scratch
```
Help me create a pitch deck for my startup:
[Description of company]
Stage: [Pre-seed/Seed/Series A]
Raising: [$X]
Key metrics: [if any]
```

### Review an Existing Pitch Deck
```
Review my pitch deck against YC/Sequoia best practices:
[Paste slide content or describe]
What's working? What needs improvement?
```

### Prepare for Demo Day
```
I have 2 minutes for Demo Day.
Here's my company: [description]
Help me structure the 2-minute pitch.
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Standard Structure

```
## Pitch Deck Structure (10-15 slides)

### Core Slides (Required)

```

---

### Step 2: Craft Each Slide

```
## Slide-by-Slide Guide

### SLIDE 1: Title
**Purpose:** First impression. Who are you?

**Include:**
- Company name and logo
- One-line description (what you do)
- Your name and contact

**Format:**
[Logo]
"[One-line description]"
[Founder Name] | [email]

**Example:**
"Stripe for healthcare payments"
"AI that writes sales emails that actually get responses"

**Don't:** Start with "We are..." or use jargon.

---

### SLIDE 2: Problem
**Purpose:** Make investors feel the pain.

**Structure:**
1. Who has the problem? (specific customer)
2. What is the problem? (concrete, relatable)
3. Why is it painful? (stakes, cost)

**Do:**
- Use a specific customer story
- Quantify the pain ($, time, frequency)
- Make it visceral/emotional

**Don't:**
- List multiple unrelated problems
- Use abstract language
- Describe your solution yet

**Example Template:**
"[Customer type] struggle with [problem].
Currently they [painful workaround].
This costs them [quantified impact]."

**Strong Example:**
"Marketing teams spend 6+ hours/week manually pulling data from 5 different tools to answer one question: 'What's working?'"

---

### SLIDE 3: Solution
**Purpose:** Your answer to the problem.

**Structure:**
1. What is your solution? (one sentence)
2. How does it work? (simple explanation)
3. What's the key insight? (why this approach)

**Do:**
- Start with the customer benefit, not features
- Keep it simple (if you can't explain simply, you don't understand it)
- Show, don't tell (visual if possible)

**Don't:**
- List features
- Use technical jargon
- Describe every capability

**Example Template:**
"[Product] is [category] that [key benefit].
Unlike [alternative], we [unique approach].
The result: [outcome]."

**Strong Example:**
"Databox pulls all your marketing data into one dashboard, automatically. No spreadsheets, no manual work. See what's working in 30 seconds."

---

### SLIDE 4: Why Now
**Purpose:** Why is THIS the moment?

**Market timing matters more than you think.**
Great ideas at the wrong time fail.

**Why Now Categories:**
- **Technology shift:** "AI/ML now makes X possible"
- **Regulatory change:** "New regulation requires X"
- **Behavior change:** "COVID changed how people X"
- **Cost inflection:** "Cloud costs dropped, now X is viable"
- **Platform shift:** "Mobile/AR/crypto created X opportunity"

**Structure:**
"[Recent change] has created [new reality].
This means [customers] now [new behavior/need].
We're positioned to [capture opportunity]."

**Don't:**
- Say "It's just time" without specifics
- Claim first mover advantage alone
- Ignore the "why not 5 years ago" question

---

### SLIDE 5: Market Size
**Purpose:** Is the opportunity big enough?

**The Hierarchy:**
- **TAM:** Total Addressable Market (everyone who could buy)
- **SAM:** Serviceable Addressable Market (who you could realistically reach)
- **SOM:** Serviceable Obtainable Market (what you'll capture in 3-5 years)

**How to Calculate:**
Bottom-up (preferred): # customers × price = market size
Top-down: Industry reports (less credible)

**What Investors Want:**
- Believable path to $100M+ revenue
- Clear logic in numbers
- SAM/SOM more important than TAM

**Example:**
"TAM: $50B (all SMB marketing software)
SAM: $5B (SMBs with marketing teams)
SOM: $500M (marketing teams using data tools)
We're targeting the SOM, growing SAM over time."

**Don't:**
- Throw out huge TAM with no logic
- Say "if we capture 1% of TAM..." (red flag)
- Ignore competition in market sizing

---

### SLIDE 6: Product
**Purpose:** Show what you built.

**Options:**
- Screenshots (annotated)
- Short demo video (30-60 sec)
- Before/After
- Product in action

**Do:**
- Show the core experience
- Highlight what's different
- Keep it simple

**Don't:**
- Show every feature
- Include UI-heavy screenshots with no context
- Use mockups if you have a real product

**For Pre-Product:**
- Show prototype/mockup
- Be clear it's not built yet
- Focus on the experience you'll create

---

### SLIDE 7: Traction
**Purpose:** Prove it's working.

**Best Traction Metrics by Stage:**

| Stage | Good Traction |
|-------|---------------|
| Pre-seed | Waitlist, LOIs, pilot customers |
| Seed | Revenue, users, growth rate |
| Series A | Revenue growth, retention, unit economics |

**Structure:**
- Lead with strongest metric
- Show growth trajectory (graph)
- Include context (timeline)

**What Investors Care About:**
1. **Growth rate** (MoM, WoW) > absolute numbers
2. **Retention** > new users
3. **Revenue** > free users
4. **Engagement** > signups

**Example:**
"$30K MRR, growing 25% MoM
100 paying customers (75% month-over-month retention)
Started charging 4 months ago"

**No Traction?**
Show other signals:
- Waitlist with conversion
- Letters of intent
- Pilot commitments
- Expert/customer testimonials

---

### SLIDE 8: Business Model
**Purpose:** How you make money.

**Include:**
- Revenue model (subscription, transaction, etc.)
- Pricing
- Unit economics (if available)

**Keep Simple:**
"We charge $X per [unit] per [period]."
"Customer pays [how much] for [what]."

**If you have data:**
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- LTV/CAC ratio (3+ is good)
- Payback period

**Example:**
"SaaS: $99/user/month
Current LTV: $2,400 | CAC: $400 | LTV/CAC: 6x
Payback: 4 months"

---

### SLIDE 9: Competition
**Purpose:** Show you understand the landscape and why you win.

**DO NOT:** Say "We have no competition."
(It means no market or you don't understand it.)

**Best Format:** 2×2 Matrix or Feature comparison

**2×2 Matrix Example:**
| | Low [Axis 1] | High [Axis 1] |
|---|---|---|
| **High [Axis 2]** | Competitor A | **YOU** |
| **Low [Axis 2]** | Competitor B | Competitor C |

Choose axes where you win.

**Alternative: Why We Win**
- We're faster because [technical advantage]
- We're cheaper because [efficiency]
- We're better for [specific segment] because [focus]

**Don't:**
- Dismiss competitors
- Show a feature matrix where you check every box
- Ignore the "do nothing" alternative

---

### SLIDE 10: Team
**Purpose:** Why YOU can pull this off.

**Include:**
- Founders (photo, name, relevant background)
- Key relevant experience
- Why this team for this problem

**What Matters:**
- Relevant domain expertise
- Relevant startup/tech experience
- Co-founder complementarity
- Prior exits (if any)

**Format:**
[Photo] Name | Role
Previously: [Relevant credential]
[One-line about why they're perfect]

**Example:**
"Jane (CEO): 10 years at Google Ads, built their SMB product
John (CTO): Ex-Stripe, scaled payments infra 100x
We met this problem daily—now we're solving it."

**If team is weak:**
- Show advisors
- Show early hires you'll make
- Be honest about gaps and how you'll fill them

---

### SLIDE 11: Ask
**Purpose:** What do you want?

**Include:**
- Amount raising
- What you'll do with it
- Key milestones you'll hit

**Example:**
"Raising $2M Seed
Use of funds:
- 50% Engineering (ship v2, integrations)
- 30% GTM (first sales hire, marketing)
- 20% Operations (12-month runway)

Milestones: $500K ARR, 500 customers, Series A ready"

**Don't:**
- Be vague about use of funds
- Ask for too wide a range ("$1-5M")
- Skip this slide
```

---

### Step 3: Apply Stage-Specific Adjustments

```
## Adjustments by Stage

### Pre-Seed ($500K-$1M)
**Focus:** Problem, solution, team, early signal
**Acceptable to not have:** Revenue, clear CAC/LTV, full team
**Key question:** "Is this a problem worth solving by these people?"

### Seed ($1M-$3M)
**Focus:** Traction, product-market fit signal, GTM hypothesis
**Expected:** Some revenue or strong engagement, clear positioning
**Key question:** "Is this working? Can it scale?"

### Series A ($5M-$15M)
**Focus:** Unit economics, scalable GTM, repeatable sales
**Expected:** $1M+ ARR, clear path to $10M+, proven CAC/LTV
**Key question:** "Does this scale? What does $100M look like?"
```

---

### Step 4: The 2-Minute Pitch (Demo Day)

```
## Demo Day Format

### Total Time: 2 minutes
### Structure:

**Hook (10 sec):**
"[Company] is [category] for [customer]."
Or: "[X] companies have [problem]. We fix that."

**Problem (20 sec):**
Who, what, why it hurts—specific and relatable.

**Solution (20 sec):**
What you built, how it works, key insight.

**Traction (20 sec):**
Best metrics, growth rate, proof it works.

**Business Model (15 sec):**
How you make money, unit economics if strong.

**Market/Why Now (15 sec):**
Big opportunity, market timing.

**Ask (10 sec):**
What you're raising, what you'll do with it.

**Close (10 sec):**
Memorable one-liner, call to action.

### Demo Day Tips
- Practice until it's natural
- Don't rush—pause for impact
- Memorize the flow, not word-for-word
- End with energy
- Have your email visible
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Pre-Seed Pitch Deck

**Input:**
> "Create a pitch deck for my AI sales email tool. We help SDRs write personalized emails. Pre-seed, raising $750K. We have a working product and 50 beta users."

**Output:**

## Pitch Deck: [SalesFlow AI]

**Slide 1: Title**
```
[SalesFlow Logo]

AI-Powered Sales Emails That Get Responses

Jane Smith | jane@salesflow.ai
```

---

**Slide 2: Problem**
```
SDRs spend 40% of their time writing emails.
Most of those emails get ignored.

The average SDR:
• Sends 100+ emails/day
• Gets <2% response rate
• Wastes 3+ hours/day on copy-paste personalization

Top performers personalize deeply—but that doesn't scale.
```

---

**Slide 3: Solution**
```
SalesFlow writes personalized emails in seconds.

Input: prospect LinkedIn + company data
Output: unique, personalized email

Not templates. Not mail merge.
Actually personalized—every email is different.

[Screenshot: Before/After of generic vs. personalized email]
```

---

**Slide 4: Why Now**
```
Three shifts make this possible:

1. GPT-4 quality: AI can write like humans now
2. Data availability: LinkedIn, company data, news all accessible
3. Buyer expectations: Generic emails don't work anymore

2024: The year personalization becomes mandatory.
```

---

**Slide 5: Market**
```
$4.5B Sales Engagement Market

TAM: $4.5B (all sales software)
SAM: $800M (email/outreach tools)
SOM: $100M (AI writing for sales)

3M+ SDRs in the US alone
Each worth $500-2000/year
```

---

**Slide 6: Product**
```
[Product screenshots showing:]
1. Paste LinkedIn URL
2. AI analyzes profile + company
3. Generates personalized email
4. One-click send to sequence

"Write 100 personalized emails in 10 minutes"
```

---

**Slide 7: Traction**
```
Early but promising:

• 50 beta users (SDRs at 20 companies)
• 15,000 emails generated
• 4.2% response rate (vs. 2% baseline)
• 3 paid pilots starting ($500/mo each)

[Graph showing weekly email volume growth]
```

---

**Slide 8: Business Model**
```
SaaS: $99/user/month

Target customer: SDR teams of 5-50
Contract value: $500-5,000/month

At scale:
CAC target: <$500
LTV: $2,000 (20-month lifespan)
LTV/CAC: 4x+
```

---

**Slide 9: Competition**

```

---

**Slide 11: Ask**
```
Raising: $750K Pre-Seed

Use of funds:
• 60% Product (AI model, integrations)
• 30% Go-to-market (first customers)
• 10% Ops (runway)

Milestones to Seed:
• $50K MRR
• 500 paying users
• Prove 2x response rate improvement
```

---

### Example 2: Demo Day Script

**Input:**
> "Write my 2-minute Demo Day pitch based on the deck above."

**Output:**

## Demo Day Script (2:00)

**[0:00-0:10] Hook**
"SDRs spend half their day writing emails that nobody opens.

SalesFlow is AI that writes personalized sales emails that actually get responses."

**[0:10-0:30] Problem**
"The average SDR sends 100 emails a day. Response rate? Under 2%.

The problem isn't effort—it's personalization. Top performers research every prospect. But that takes hours—it doesn't scale.

Generic emails don't work anymore. Buyers know when they're in a sequence."

**[0:30-0:55] Solution**
"SalesFlow solves this. You give us a LinkedIn profile. Our AI reads their background, their company, recent news, and writes a unique email—not a template, not mail merge—actually personalized.

What took 5 minutes now takes 5 seconds. Scale AND personalization."

**[0:55-1:15] Traction**
"We launched 8 weeks ago. 50 beta users have sent 15,000 emails.

Their response rates doubled—4.2% versus the 2% baseline.

We just signed our first three paying pilots, $500 a month each. This works."

**[1:15-1:30] Business Model + Market**
"We charge $99 per user per month. There are 3 million SDRs in the US—this is an $800 million market.

The shift to AI writing is happening now. GPT-4 made this possible."

**[1:30-1:45] Team**
"I'm Jane. I spent 8 years at Salesforce selling to these teams. Tom, my co-founder, built GPT applications at OpenAI.

We lived this problem. Now we're solving it."

**[1:45-2:00] Ask**
"We're raising $750K to get to $50K MRR and prove we can 2x response rates at scale.

If you're an SDR, a sales leader, or an investor who's tired of bad cold emails—come talk to us.

SalesFlow. Personalized emails that get responses."
