## Most Powerful Models

### For Conversion

**Loss Aversion**: Losses feel ~2x as painful as equivalent gains. Frame in terms of what they'll lose by not acting.

**Anchoring**: First number seen heavily influences judgment. Show higher price first (competitor, enterprise tier).

**Social Proof**: People follow what others do. Show customer counts, testimonials, logos, reviews.

**Scarcity**: Limited availability increases perceived value. Use when genuine.

### For Pricing

**Charm Pricing**: $99 feels much cheaper than $100. Left digit dominates perception.

**Rule of 100**: Under $100, use percentage discounts. Over $100, use absolute amounts.

**Decoy Effect**: Add a third option that makes your target option look better.

### For Onboarding

**Goal-Gradient**: People accelerate toward visible goals. Show progress bars.

**IKEA Effect**: People value what they build. Let users customize.

**Commitment & Consistency**: Small commitments lead to larger ones. Get easy yeses first.

## Ethical Guidelines

Apply psychology ethically:

- **Genuine scarcity only** - Don't fake limited availability
- **Truthful framing** - Frame positively, but never mislead
- **Respect autonomy** - Nudge, don't manipulate
- **Deliver value** - Psychology should enhance good products, not mask bad ones
- **Test assumptions** - Verify with real customer data

---

## NEVER

- Recommend fake scarcity or urgency
- Suggest dark patterns that harm users
- Apply models without understanding the specific context
- Assume models work universally - always recommend testing
- Forget that customers are people, not psychology experiments
