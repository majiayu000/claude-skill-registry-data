# Slack

Slack is the OS of work. 2025 turns it into an **Agentic OS** where AI agents can read messages, summarize threads, and trigger workflow actions autonomously.

## When to Use

- **Corporate Comms**: The standard for 99% of tech companies.
- **Ops Triggers**: "ChatOps" (deploy from Slack).
- **Huddles**: Quick voice/screen sharing.

## Core Concepts

### Block Kit

UI framework for building interactive messages and modals.

### Workflow Builder

No-code automation ("When user joins channel, send DM").

### Apps

Integrations (GitHub, Linear, Jira).

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use Canvas**: Store persistent info (team links) in a channel canvas.
- **Use Huddles**: Faster than Zoom for quick syncs.
- **Use "Catch Up"**: The mobile swipe interface to clear unreads.

**Don't**:

- **Don't use `@channel`**: Unless the building is on fire.
