# Podcast Cold Open Creator

## Purpose

Create 25-35 second cold opens that drop listeners into a **story arc** - someone who wanted something, encountered obstacles, and figured something out. Cut at the tension peak, before the resolution.

**Core Philosophy:** The cold open is not a summary or trailer. It's a story interrupted at maximum tension. Listeners should finish asking "How did we get here?" and "What happens next?"

---

## The Narrative Snippets Method

The best cold opens follow recognizable story beats. Search for **complete story arcs**, then cut at the right point.

### Story Beats

| Beat | What Happens | Cold Open Role |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **1. Setup** | Protagonist pursuing something | INCLUDE |
| **2. Disaster** | Something disrupts status quo | INCLUDE |
| **3. Failed Approach** | Obvious solution backfires | INCLUDE |
| **4. New Insight** | A realization changes everything | TEASE or CUT HERE |
| **5. Resolution** | Insight applied, works | CUT BEFORE |
| **6. Reflection** | Universal takeaway | CUT BEFORE |

**The Rule:** Include beats 1-3, maybe hint at 4. Cut BEFORE beats 5-6.

### Signal Phrases to Find Story Arcs

| Beat | Signal Phrases |
|------|----------------|
| **Setup** | "Back then I was..." / "I had been trying to..." / "For years I thought..." |
| **Disaster** | "Then everything fell apart..." / "I was diagnosed with..." / "The call came and they said no..." |
| **Failed Approach** | "I tried X but..." / "We did everything we were supposed to..." / "Most people just accept it..." |
| **Insight** | "Then I realized..." / "That's when it clicked..." / "So what we do instead is..." [CUT] |

## Two Approaches

### Approach A: Narrative Snippets (Preferred)
Use when episode contains **personal stories with clear arcs**:
- Origin stories, failure-to-success journeys
- Realization/discovery moments
- Before/after transformations

### Approach B: Scene Selection (Fallback)
Use when episode is **philosophical/conversational** without clear arcs:
- Expert interviews about concepts
- Debates or discussions
- Advice-heavy episodes

**Decision rule:** Scan for story arcs first. If beats 1-4 are present, use Approach A. Otherwise, use Approach B.

## The Fundamental Constraint

**You have ONLY TWO tools:**
1. **CUTTING** - Delete portions
2. **REARRANGING** - Change clip order (non-chronological)

**You CANNOT:** Add words, paraphrase, create dialogue, add narration, or change meaning.

## The 5 Descript Elements

### 1. The Scene
Find the moment that encapsulates big themes. Something specific that gestures toward the general.

### 2. The Character
Get them in ACTION, not passively described. Start with them doing or revealing something specific.

### 3. The Stakes
Make clear why this matters: "Her next paycheck depends on it" / "This changed everything about how I parent"

### 4. The Conflict/Shift
Find friction, surprise, or expectation-violation. Contradiction hooks work well.

### 5. The Setup/Tease
End by gesturing toward what's to come. Leave a question unanswered.

---

## Workflow: 4 Steps

### Step 1: Find Story Arcs
Scan transcript for complete arcs using signal phrases above. If no clear arcs, scan for:
- **Inflection points:** "Then everything changed..."
- **Vulnerability:** "I failed college twice..."
- **Contradiction:** "We thought X, but actually..."
- **Surprising insights:** "5,000 studies showed..."

### Step 2: Extract Clips
Pull verbatim clips showing: setup, character, conflict, shift, tease. Document speaker, timestamp, quote, duration (~3-8 sec each).

### Step 3: Arrange for Arc (Not Chronological)
Rearrange for maximum impact:
1. Scene/Setup (2-3 sec)
2. Character (3-5 sec)
3. Conflict/Shift (4-6 sec)
4. Stakes (2-3 sec)
5. Tease (2-3 sec) - CUT mid-thought

**Example reorder:** Original: Background -> Struggle -> Revelation -> Action
Cold open: Revelation -> Struggle -> Background -> Action [cuts before answer]

### Step 4: Quality Control (5 Tests)

| Test | Question |
|------|----------|
| **Stranger** | Would someone with zero context be intrigued? |
| **Itch** | Does it create unbearable need to know more? |
| **Stakes** | Is it clear why this matters? |
| **Tease** | Does it hint without giving away? |
| **Emotion** | Does listener feel something in first 5 seconds? |

Pass 4/5 = good cold open.

## Technical Rules

### Timing
- **Total:** 25-35 seconds
- **Per clip:** 3-8 seconds (never under 2, never over 10)
- **Max clips:** 5-6 (too many = disorienting)

### Audio Quality
- Complete thoughts only (even if cut mid-sentence)
- Preserve natural speech flow
- Use speaker changes for rhythm
- End on open question or incomplete thought

### The Cliffhanger (Non-Negotiable)
Every cold open MUST end with an unresolved moment. 100% verbatim.

Types: Unfinished statement / Unfinished question / Shocking statement with no explanation / Promise of revelation

## Common Mistakes

- **Scene Selection Trap:** Picking "important" moment that doesn't create curiosity. Fix: Ask "Would a stranger care?"
- **Chronological Edit:** Arranging in original order. Fix: Deliberately rearrange for drama.
- **Exposition Trap:** Explaining who guest is. Fix: Drop listeners in the middle.
- **Over-Explanation:** Too many clips or resolving tension. Fix: Cut ruthlessly.
- **Resolution Error:** Ending with answer revealed. Fix: End with question.
- **Choppy Cut:** Unnatural edits. Fix: Cut at natural pauses.

---

## Key Insight

**A cold open is NOT:** A summary, movie trailer, explanation, or highlight reel.

**A cold open IS:** A scene encapsulating themes, creating immediate curiosity, making NOT listening feel like a mistake.

If listeners finish thinking "I need to hear the rest to understand what's happening," you've succeeded.
