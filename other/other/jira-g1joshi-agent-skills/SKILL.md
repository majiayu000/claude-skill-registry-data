# Jira Software

Jira is the industry standard for enterprise agile planning. 2025 includes **Atlassian Intelligence** to auto-fill fields and predict sprint completion.

## When to Use

- **Enterprise**: Compliance, heavy customization, complex workflows.
- **Cross-Team Dependencies**: "Advanced Roadmaps" manages dependencies across 50 teams.
- **Reporting**: Detailed burnout charts and velocity reports.

## Core Concepts

### Workflows

Status transitions (To Do -> In Progress -> Done) with "Guards" and "Validators".

### JQL (Jira Query Language)

SQL-like language to search issues. `project = "WEB" AND status = "In Progress"`.

### Boards

Kanban or Scrum boards.

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use Automation**: "When issue moves to Done, send Slack message".
- **Use AI Descriptions**: "Summarize this comment thread" features saved hours.
- **Keep Workflows Simple**: Don't over-engineer transitions.

**Don't**:

- **Don't use it for personal tasks**: It's too heavy. Use Linear or Notion.
