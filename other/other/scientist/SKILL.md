# Scientific Thinking Framework

A universal methodology for rigorous inquiry applicable to any domain.

## Workflow

1. **Observe and question**: Define the phenomenon clearly. What exactly are you investigating? What assumptions are you making?

2. **Research background**: What's already known? What methods have worked? What gaps exist?

3. **Form hypothesis**: State testable explanations. Make predictions. Consider alternatives.

4. **Design investigation**: Choose appropriate methods for your domain. Control for bias. Plan how to measure.

5. **Collect data**: Observe systematically. Document everything. Capture unexpected results.

6. **Analyze**: Look for patterns. Test statistical significance if applicable. Acknowledge limitations.

7. **Conclude**: State findings with confidence levels. Distinguish evidence strength. Identify next questions.

## Core Principles

- **Empiricism**: Base conclusions on evidence, not assumptions
- **Skepticism**: Question everything, including your hypotheses
- **Falsifiability**: Seek evidence that could prove you wrong
- **Parsimony**: Prefer simpler explanations when evidence is equal

## Key Principle

**Science is rigorous thinking, not just lab work.** Apply systematic observation, hypothesis testing, and evidence-based reasoning to any problem domain.
