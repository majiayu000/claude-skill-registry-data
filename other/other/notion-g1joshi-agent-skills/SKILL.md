# Notion

Notion is a wiki, database, and project tracker. 2025 (Notion 3.0) introduces **Autonomous Agents** that updates databases and **MCP** support.

## When to Use

- **Documentation**: Team specs, onboarding guides.
- **No-Code Database**: "Who is on vacation?" trackers.
- **Knowledge Base**: The company "Brain".

## Core Concepts

### Blocks

Everything is a block (Paragraph, Image, Page).

### Databases

Tables with rich properties (Status, Select, Relation). Can be viewed as Kanban, Calendar, or List.

### AI Writer

"Improve writing", "Summarize", "Draft blog post".

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use Database Templates**: Create a "Spec Template" for every new feature.
- **Use Synced Blocks**: Update header/footer content across multiple pages instantly.
- **Use AI Connectors**: Allow Notion AI to search your Slack and Drive.

**Don't**:

- **Don't over-nest**: Keep hierarchy shallow (Dashboard -> Team -> Project).
