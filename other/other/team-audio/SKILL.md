argument-hint: "[feature or area to design audio for]"
user-invocable: true
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Write, Edit, Bash, Task

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Read the argument** for the target feature or area (e.g., `combat`,
   `main menu`, `forest biome`, `boss encounter`).

2. **Gather context**:
   - Read relevant design docs in `design/gdd/` for the feature
   - Read the sound bible at `design/gdd/sound-bible.md` if it exists
   - Read existing audio asset lists in `assets/audio/`
   - Read any existing sound design docs for this area

## How to Delegate

Use the Task tool to spawn each team member as a subagent:
- `subagent_type: audio-director` — Sonic identity, emotional tone, audio palette
- `subagent_type: sound-designer` — SFX specifications, audio events, mixing groups
- `subagent_type: technical-artist` — Audio middleware, bus structure, memory budgets
- `subagent_type: gameplay-programmer` — Audio manager, gameplay triggers, adaptive music

Always provide full context in each agent's prompt (feature description, existing audio assets, design doc references).

3. **Orchestrate the audio team** in sequence:

### Step 1: Audio Direction (audio-director)
Spawn the `audio-director` agent to:
- Define the sonic identity for this feature/area
- Specify the emotional tone and audio palette
- Set music direction (adaptive layers, stems, transitions)
- Define audio priorities and mix targets
- Establish any adaptive audio rules (combat intensity, exploration, tension)

### Step 2: Sound Design (sound-designer)
Spawn the `sound-designer` agent to:
- Create detailed SFX specifications for every audio event
- Define sound categories (ambient, UI, gameplay, music, dialogue)
- Specify per-sound parameters (volume range, pitch variation, attenuation)
- Plan audio event list with trigger conditions
- Define mixing groups and ducking rules

### Step 3: Technical Implementation (technical-artist)
Spawn the `technical-artist` agent to:
- Design the audio middleware integration (Wwise/FMOD/native)
- Define audio bus structure and routing
- Specify memory budgets for audio assets per platform
- Plan streaming vs preloaded asset strategy
- Design any audio-reactive visual effects

### Step 4: Code Integration (gameplay-programmer)
Spawn the `gameplay-programmer` agent to:
- Implement audio manager system or review existing
- Wire up audio events to gameplay triggers
- Implement adaptive music system (if specified)
- Set up audio occlusion/reverb zones
- Write unit tests for audio event triggers

4. **Compile the audio design document** combining all team outputs.

5. **Save to** `design/gdd/audio-[feature].md`.

6. **Output a summary** with: audio event count, estimated asset count,
   implementation tasks, and any open questions between team members.
