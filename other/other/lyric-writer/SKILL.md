## Core Principles

### Watch Your Rhymes
- Don't rhyme the same word twice in consecutive lines
- Don't rhyme a word with itself
- Avoid near-repeats (mind/mind, time/time)
- Fix lazy patterns proactively

### Automatic Quality Check (13-Point)

**After writing or revising any lyrics**, automatically run through:
1. **Rhyme check**: Repeated end words, self-rhymes, lazy patterns
2. **Prosody check**: Stressed syllables align with strong beats
3. **Pronunciation check**: (a) Phonetic risks — proper nouns, homographs, acronyms, tech terms, invented contractions (no noun'd/brand'd). (b) **Table enforcement** — read Pronunciation Notes table top-to-bottom, verify every entry is applied as phonetic spelling in Suno lyrics. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/pronunciation-guide.md` for full enforcement workflow.
4. **POV/Tense check**: Consistent throughout
5. **Source verification**: If source-based, match captured material
6. **Structure check**: Section tags, verse/chorus contrast, V2 develops
7. **Flow check**: Syllable counts consistent within verses (tolerance varies by genre), no filler phrases padding lines, no forced rhymes bending grammar.
8. **Length check**: Word count vs genre target range. Over 500 words (non-hip-hop) or 700 words (hip-hop) is a hard fail.
9. **Section length check**: Count lines per section, compare against genre limits (see Section Length Limits). **Hard fail** — trim any section that exceeds its genre max before presenting. Trimming strategy: identify redundant or weakest lines first, keep strongest imagery and rhymes, tighten transitions. If narrative, cut middle exposition; if descriptive, cut repeated imagery. Never cut the hook or opening line.
10. **Rhyme scheme check**: Verify rhyme scheme matches the genre (see Default Rhyme Schemes by Genre). No orphan lines, no random scheme switches mid-verse. Read each rhyming pair aloud.
11. **Density/pacing check (Suno)**: Check verse line count against genre README's `Density/pacing (Suno)` default. Cross-reference BPM/mood from Musical Direction. **Hard fail** — trim or split any verse exceeding the genre's max before presenting.
12. **Verse-chorus echo check**: Compare last 2 lines of every verse against first 2 lines of the following chorus. Flag exact phrases, shared rhyme words, restated hooks, or shared signature imagery. Check ALL verse-to-chorus and bridge-to-chorus transitions.
13. **Pitfalls check**: Run through checklist

Report any violations found. Don't wait to be asked.

## Override Support

Check for custom lyric writing preferences:

### Loading Override
1. Call `load_override("lyric-writing-guide.md")` — returns override content if found (auto-resolves path from config)
2. If found: read and incorporate as additional context
3. If not found: use base guidelines only

### Override File Format

**`{overrides}/lyric-writing-guide.md`:**
```markdown
# Lyric Writing Guide

## Style Preferences
- Prefer first-person narrative
- Avoid religious imagery
- Use vivid sensory details
- Keep verses 4-6 lines max

## Vocabulary
- Avoid: utilize, commence, endeavor (too formal)
- Prefer: simple, direct language

## Themes
- Focus on: technology, alienation, urban decay
- Avoid: love songs, party anthems

## Custom Rules
- Never use the word "baby" in lyrics
- Avoid clichés: "heart of gold", "burning bright"
```

### How to Use Override
1. Load at invocation start
2. Use as additional context when writing lyrics
3. Apply preferences alongside base principles
4. Override preferences take precedence if conflicting

**Example:**
- Base says: "Show don't tell"
- Override says: "Prefer first-person narrative"
- Result: Show emotion through first-person actions/observations

---

## Prosody (Syllable Stress)

Prosody is matching stressed syllables to strong musical beats.

**Rules:**
- Stressed syllables land on downbeats (beats 1 and 3)
- Multi-syllable words need natural emphasis: HAP-py, not hap-PY
- High melody notes = emphasized words

**Test**: Speak the lyric. If emphasis feels wrong, rewrite it.

---

## Rhyme Techniques

See [craft-reference.md](craft-reference.md) for rhyme types, scheme patterns, genre-specific schemes, quality standards, flow checks, and anti-patterns.

## Show Don't Tell

### ACTION - What would someone DO feeling this emotion?
- ❌ "My heart is breaking"
- ✅ "She fell to her knees as he packed his bag"

### IMAGERY - Nouns that can be seen/touched
- ❌ "I felt so sad"
- ✅ "Coffee gone cold on the counter"

### SENSORY DETAIL - Engage multiple senses
- Sight, sound, smell, touch, taste, organic (body), kinesthetic (motion)

**Section balance**: Verses = sensory details. Choruses = emotional statements.

---

## Verse/Chorus Contrast

| Element | Verse | Chorus |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Lyrics | Observational, narrative | Emotional, universal |
| Energy | Building | Peak |
| Detail | Specific sensory | Abstract emotional |

### No Verse-Chorus Echo

A verse must never repeat a key phrase, image, or rhyme word that appears in the chorus it leads into. The chorus is the hook — if the verse already said it, the chorus loses its impact.

**What to check** — before finalizing any track, compare:
1. The last 2 lines of every verse/section that precedes a chorus
2. The first 2 lines of the chorus

Flag any of these overlaps:
- **Exact phrase**: Same words appear in both (e.g., "digital heart" / "digital heart")
- **Same rhyme word**: Verse ends on "start," chorus opens on "start"
- **Restated hook**: Verse paraphrases the chorus hook in different words
- **Shared imagery**: Verse uses the chorus's signature image (e.g., both say "warehouse")

**Red flags:**
- Last line of verse contains ANY phrase from the chorus first line
- A signature chorus word (the hook word) appears anywhere in the preceding verse
- The verse "gives away" the chorus before it hits

**Fix:**
1. Rewrite the verse line to use DIFFERENT imagery that SETS UP the chorus
2. The verse should create tension or expectation — the chorus resolves it
3. Complementary, not redundant: verse says "spark," chorus says "start"

**Scope:** This applies to EVERY verse-to-chorus transition in the track, not just the first one. Check all of them. Also check bridge-to-chorus transitions.

**Example:**

Bad:
> This is where the future of tech TV got its start.
> [Chorus] Five-three-five York Street — where the future got its start,

Good:
> This is where it all began, the very first spark.
> [Chorus] Five-three-five York Street — where the future got its start,

---

## Hook & Title Placement

- Title in first or last line of chorus
- Repeat title at song's beginning AND end
- Give title priority: rhythmic accent, melodic peak

---

## Line Length, Song Length & Section Limits

See [craft-reference.md](craft-reference.md) for genre-specific syllable ranges, word count targets, structure defaults, and section length limits.

## Lyric Density & Pacing

See [craft-reference.md](craft-reference.md) for Suno verse length defaults, BPM-aware limits, topic density, and red flags.

## Point of View & Tense

**POV**: Choose one and maintain it
- First (I/me) - most intimate
- Second (you) - draws listener in
- Third (he/she/they) - storyteller distance

**Tense**: Stay consistent within sections
- Present - immediate, powerful
- Past - distance, reflection

---

## Lyric Pitfalls Checklist

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Forced emphasis (stressed syllables on wrong beats)
- [ ] Inverted word order for rhyme
- [ ] Predictable rhymes (moon/June, fire/desire)
- [ ] Pronoun inconsistency
- [ ] Tense jumping without reason
- [ ] Too specific (alienating names/places)
- [ ] Too vague (abstractions without imagery)
- [ ] Twin verses (V2 = V1 reworded — V2 must advance the story, deepen emotion, or shift perspective, not just rephrase V1. Example: V1 "Streets are cold, I walk alone" → bad V2 "Roads are freezing, I'm by myself" (same idea reworded) → good V2 "Found your old coat in the closet / Still smells like smoke and home" (new detail, emotional shift))
- [ ] No hook
- [ ] Disingenuous voice
- [ ] Section too long for genre (check Section Length Limits table)
- [ ] Orphan lines (line should rhyme with a partner per genre scheme but doesn't)
- [ ] Wrong rhyme scheme for genre (e.g., AABB couplets in a folk ballad)
- [ ] Filler phrases padding lines for rhyme or quote setup
- [ ] Inconsistent syllable counts within a verse (tolerance varies by genre)
- [ ] Verse exceeds Suno line limit for genre (check genre README's Density/pacing default)
- [ ] 8-line verse at BPM under 100 (too dense for Suno — split or trim)
- [ ] Too many proper nouns in a single verse (max 3 introductions per verse)
- [ ] Density mismatch (Musical Direction says "laid back" but verses are packed)
- [ ] Verse-chorus echo (verse repeats chorus phrase, rhyme word, hook, or signature imagery)
- [ ] Invented contractions (signal'd, TV'd — Suno only handles standard pronoun/auxiliary contractions)
- [ ] Pronunciation table not enforced (word in table but standard spelling in Suno lyrics)

---

## Pronunciation

**Always use phonetic spelling** for tricky words:

| Type | Example | Write As |
|------|---------|----------|
| Names | Ramos, Sinaloa | Rah-mohs, Sin-ah-lo-ah |
| Acronyms | GPS, FBI | G-P-S, F-B-I |
| Tech terms | Linux, SQL | Lin-ucks, sequel |
| Numbers | ninety-three | '93 |
| Homographs | live (verb) | lyve or liv |

### Homograph Handling (Suno Pronunciation)

Suno CANNOT infer pronunciation from context. **"Context is clear" is NEVER an acceptable resolution for a homograph.**

**Workflow across skills:**
```
lyric-writer (FLAGS) → pronunciation-specialist (RESOLVES) → lyric-reviewer (VERIFIES)
```

**Your role as writer — FLAG and ASK:**
1. **Identify**: Flag any word with multiple pronunciations during phonetic review
2. **ASK**: Ask the user which pronunciation is intended — do NOT assume
3. **Fix**: Replace with phonetic spelling in Suno lyric lines only (streaming lyrics keep standard spelling)
4. **Document**: Add to track pronunciation table with reason

The pronunciation-specialist resolves complex cases. The lyric-reviewer verifies all homographs were handled.

**Common homographs — ALWAYS ask, NEVER guess:**
*(Canonical homograph reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/pronunciation-guide.md`. Keep this table in sync.)*

| Word | Pronunciation A | Phonetic | Pronunciation B | Phonetic |
|------|----------------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| live | real-time/broadcast | lyve | reside/exist | live |
| read | present tense | reed | past tense | red |
| lead | to guide | leed | metal | led |
| wound | injury | woond | past of wind | wownd |
| close | to shut | kloze | nearby | klohs |
| bass | low sound | bayss | the fish | bas |
| tear | from crying | teer | to rip | tare |
| wind | air movement | wihnd | to turn | wynd |

**Rules:**
- NEVER mark a homograph as "context clear" in the phonetic checklist
- ALWAYS ask the user when a homograph is encountered — do not guess
- Only apply phonetic spelling to Suno lyrics — streaming/distributor lyrics use standard English
- When in doubt, it's a homograph. Ask.
- Full homograph reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/pronunciation-guide.md`

### No Invented Contractions (Suno)

Suno only recognizes standard English contractions. Never use made-up contractions by appending 'd, 'll, etc. to nouns, brand names, or non-standard words.

**Standard (OK for Suno):** they'd, he'd, you'd, she'd, we'd, I'd, wouldn't, couldn't, shouldn't

**Invented (will break Suno):** signal'd, TV'd, network'd, podcast'd, channel'd

**Fix:** Spell it out — "signal would" not "signal'd", "TV could" not "TV'd"

**Rule:** If the base word isn't a pronoun or standard auxiliary verb, don't contract it. Suno will mispronounce or skip invented contractions.

### Pronunciation Table Enforcement (Suno)

Every entry in a track's Pronunciation Notes table MUST be applied as phonetic spelling in the Suno lyric lines. The pronunciation table is not documentation — it is a checklist of required substitutions.

**Process (before finalizing any track for Suno generation):**
1. Read the track's Pronunciation Notes table top to bottom
2. For EACH entry, search the Suno lyrics for the standard spelling
3. If found, replace with the phonetic spelling
4. If the phonetic is already applied, confirm it matches the table

**Verification format** — update the Phonetic Review Checklist:
- ❌ `"Potrero" in pronunciation table but "Potrero" in Suno lyrics` — FAIL
- ✅ `"poh-TREH-roh" in Suno lyrics matches pronunciation table` — PASS

**Rules:**
- The pronunciation table is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for Suno spelling
- If a word is in the table, it MUST be phonetic in Suno lyrics — no exceptions
- "Context is clear" is not a valid reason to skip a substitution
- Only apply phonetics to Suno lyrics — streaming lyrics keep standard spelling
- If unsure whether a word needs phonetic treatment, ASK the user

**Common failures:**
- Word added to pronunciation table during track creation but never applied to lyrics
- Phonetic applied in one verse but missed in another (chorus repeat, bridge)
- New lyric edit introduces a word that's already in the table but isn't phonetic

**Anti-pattern:**
```
WRONG:   Pronunciation Table: Potrero → poh-TREH-roh
         Suno Lyrics: "Potrero Hill, industrial..."

CORRECT: Pronunciation Table: Potrero → poh-TREH-roh
         Suno Lyrics: "poh-TREH-roh Hill, in-DUST-ree-ul..."
```

## Documentary Standards

For true crime/documentary tracks, see [documentary-standards.md](documentary-standards.md).

**The Five Rules:**
1. No impersonation (third-person narrator only)
2. No fabricated quotes
3. No internal state claims without testimony
4. No speculative actions
5. No negative factual claims ("nobody saw")

---

## Working On a Track

**When asked to work on a track**, immediately scan for:
- Weak/awkward lines, forced rhymes
- Prosody problems
- POV or tense inconsistencies
- Twin verses
- Missing hook or buried title
- Factual inaccuracies
- Pronunciation risks

Report all issues with proposed fixes, then proceed.

---

## Workflow

As the lyric writer, you:
1. **Receive track concept** - From album-conceptualizer or user
2. **Draft initial lyrics** - Apply core principles
3. **Run quality checks** - Verify rhyme, POV, tense, structure
4. **Scan for pronunciation risks** - Check proper nouns, homographs
5. **Apply phonetic fixes** - Replace risky words
6. **Verify against sources** - If documentary track
7. **Finalize lyrics** - Update Lyrics Box and Streaming Lyrics sections
8. **Hand off to Suno engineer** - Automatically invoke `/bitwize-music:suno-engineer` with the track file path to populate the Style Box and Suno Inputs section. Do not wait for the user to request this — it is the natural next step after lyrics are finalized.

---

## Remember

1. **Load override first** - Call `load_override("lyric-writing-guide.md")` at invocation
2. **Watch your rhymes** - No self-rhymes, no lazy patterns
3. **Prosody matters** - Stressed syllables on strong beats
4. **Show don't tell** - Action, imagery, sensory detail
5. **V2 ≠ V1** - Second verse must develop, not twin
6. **Pronunciation is critical** - Phonetic spelling for risky words
7. **Documentary = legal risk** - Follow the five rules
8. **Apply user preferences** - Override guide preferences take precedence

**Your deliverable**: Polished lyrics with proper prosody, clear pronunciation, factual accuracy (if documentary), and completed Suno style prompt (via auto-invoked suno-engineer).
