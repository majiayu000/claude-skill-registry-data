# One-on-Ones

> Transform the most important meeting on your calendar. Master the art of 1:1s that build trust, develop people, and surface problems before they become crises.

## When to Use This Skill

- **New manager** learning to run effective 1:1s
- **Improving existing 1:1s** that feel unproductive
- **Building relationships** with new direct reports
- **Developing talent** through coaching conversations
- **Addressing performance issues** early
- **Scaling management** as your team grows

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Sources** | Andy Grove (High Output Management), Kim Scott (Radical Candor), Michael Lopp (Managing Humans), Ben Horowitz |
| **Core Principle** | "The 1:1 is the direct report's meeting, not the manager's. It's their time to surface what matters to them." |
| **Why This Matters** | 1:1s are the highest-leverage relationship-building activity a manager has. Done well, they catch problems early, build trust, and develop people. Done poorly, they're wasted time. |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Structures effective 1:1s** - Cadence, agenda, format
2. **Teaches listening over talking** - Manager as coach, not lecturer
3. **Builds trust systematically** - Through consistency and care
4. **Surfaces problems early** - Before they become crises
5. **Develops direct reports** - Career and skill growth
6. **Handles difficult conversations** - Performance, conflict, change

## How to Use

### Design Your 1:1 System
```
I manage [X] people. Help me design a 1:1 system.
Current state: [what you're doing now]
Challenges: [what's not working]
```

### Run a Specific 1:1
```
I have a 1:1 with [name] who is [context].
Help me prepare for this conversation.
```

### Address a Specific Issue in 1:1
```
I need to discuss [issue] with [name] in our 1:1.
Help me approach this conversation effectively.
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Purpose of 1:1s

```
## Why 1:1s Matter

### The Manager's Highest Leverage Activity

**Andy Grove:**
"The 1:1 is the most important meeting you have because
it's the only one where you can develop your people."

**Kim Scott:**
"1:1s are where you show you care personally and where
you give and get the feedback that challenges directly."

### What 1:1s Are For

**Information flow:**
- Learn what's really happening on the ground
- Hear problems before they explode
- Understand context you'd otherwise miss

**Relationship building:**
- Show you care about them as a person
- Build trust that enables hard conversations
- Create psychological safety

**Development:**
- Coach on skills and career
- Give and receive feedback
- Support their growth

**Alignment:**
- Ensure they understand priorities
- Clear blockers and confusion
- Connect their work to bigger picture

### What 1:1s Are NOT For

**Status updates:**
- That's what standups and written updates are for
- If you're spending 1:1 time on status, you're wasting it

**Manager's agenda only:**
- This is their meeting, not yours
- Your agenda should be secondary

**Lecture time:**
- If you're talking 80% of the time, you're doing it wrong
- Aim for 10% you / 90% them (or at most 50/50)
```

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Mechanics

```
## 1:1 Structure and Cadence

### Frequency

| Task-Relevant Maturity | Frequency | Duration |
|------------------------|-----------|----------|
| New/struggling | 2x/week | 30-45 min |
| Developing | Weekly | 30-45 min |
| Senior/independent | Bi-weekly | 45-60 min |

**Default:** Weekly for most people.
**Never:** Less than bi-weekly. Relationship degrades.

### Scheduling

**Sacred time:**
- Block on both calendars
- Rarely cancel, never consistently
- Canceling sends a message: "You're not important"

**Consistency:**
- Same time each week
- Builds routine and expectation

**Location:**
- Walk-and-talks for casual
- Private room for sensitive topics
- Mix it up to prevent staleness

### Agenda Ownership

**Their meeting, their agenda:**
- They set the agenda
- They share topics in advance
- You add to it, not replace it

**Shared document:**
- Running notes doc both can access
- They add topics before meeting
- You both reference during
- You document key points after

### Time Allocation

**Sample 30-minute breakdown:**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0-5 min | Check-in: How are you? |
| 5-20 min | Their agenda items |
| 20-25 min | Your questions/topics |
| 25-30 min | Commitments and close |

**Ratio target:** They talk 70-90% of the time.
```

---

### Step 3: Master 1:1 Conversations

```
## The 1:1 Conversation Framework

### Opening: The Check-In

**Purpose:** Understand where they're at as a person.

**Good openers:**
- "How are you doing, really?"
- "What's on your mind this week?"
- "How's your energy level?"
- "What's going well? What's challenging?"

**Listen for:**
- Energy and mood
- Life context (personal stuff affecting work)
- Things they might not put on the agenda

### Middle: Their Agenda

**Your job:** Listen. Ask questions. Help them think.

**Key questions:**
- "Tell me more about that."
- "What have you tried?"
- "What options are you considering?"
- "What do you think you should do?"
- "How can I help?"

**Coaching mode:**
Ask → Listen → Ask more → Let them reach conclusions
Don't jump to solving unless they ask for a solution.

**When they bring problems:**
- Resist the urge to fix immediately
- "What have you already considered?"
- "If you had to decide today, what would you do?"
- Give advice only after exploring their thinking

### Middle: Your Topics

**Keep these secondary to their agenda.**

**Topics you might raise:**
- Feedback (positive or constructive)
- Important context/information
- Questions you have about their work
- Development check-ins
- Things you've observed

### Closing: Commitments

**Before ending:**
- "What did we agree to?"
- "What are you committing to?"
- "What am I committing to?"
- "Anything else before we wrap?"

**Document commitments.** Review next time.
```

---

### Step 4: Different 1:1 Types

```
## 1:1 Conversation Types

### The Standard 1:1

**When:** Regular weekly/bi-weekly
**Focus:** What's on their mind
**Your role:** Listen, coach, unblock

### The Career Development 1:1

**When:** Monthly or quarterly
**Focus:** Longer-term growth

**Questions:**
- "Where do you want to be in 2-3 years?"
- "What skills do you want to develop?"
- "What would make this the best job you've ever had?"
- "What are you curious about learning?"
- "What's not in your role that you'd like to try?"

**Output:** Development plan or action items

### The Feedback 1:1

**When:** When there's specific feedback to give

**Structure:**
1. Context: "I want to share something I noticed..."
2. Observation: Specific, not general
3. Impact: Why it matters
4. Discussion: Their perspective
5. Forward: What should change

**See:** Radical Candor skill for detailed approach

### The Performance Conversation

**When:** Performance is concerning

**Structure:**
1. Clear statement of gap
2. Specific examples
3. Their perspective
4. Clear expectations
5. Support and timeline
6. Consequences if not addressed

**Key:** Document this conversation.

### The Trust-Building 1:1

**When:** New relationship or rebuilding

**Focus:** Learning about each other

**Questions:**
- "Tell me about your path to here."
- "What do you like best about your work?"
- "How do you like to receive feedback?"
- "What do you need from me to do your best work?"
- "What's something I should know about you?"

### The Skip-Level 1:1

**When:** You meet with people 2+ levels down

**Purpose:**
- Build relationship directly
- Hear unfiltered perspective
- Develop talent beyond your directs

**Respect the middle manager:**
- Don't give directives to their reports
- Share context back (with permission)
- Support, don't undermine
```

---

### Step 5: Handle Common Challenges

```
## 1:1 Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: "Everything is fine"

**Symptom:** They say nothing is wrong every week.

**Solutions:**
1. Wait in silence longer. Discomfort opens up conversation.
2. Ask different questions:
   - "What would you change if you could?"
   - "What's annoying you lately?"
   - "If you were me, what would you do differently?"
3. Share your own challenges first. Model vulnerability.
4. Ask about specific people/projects.

### Challenge: Turns into status update

**Symptom:** They just list what they did.

**Solutions:**
1. Interrupt gently: "I can read status—what do you need from me?"
2. Redirect: "What's challenging about that?"
3. Start differently: "What's on your mind?" not "What's the update?"
4. Use a shared doc for status, use meeting for discussion.

### Challenge: Venting without action

**Symptom:** Same complaints every week, nothing changes.

**Solutions:**
1. Acknowledge, then redirect: "I hear you. What do you want to do about it?"
2. Ask: "What would you need to see to feel better about this?"
3. Name the pattern: "I notice we've talked about this for several weeks. Are you ready to address it?"
4. Offer help: "Do you want me to intervene, or do you want to handle it?"

### Challenge: Only surface-level

**Symptom:** Conversation stays professional and distant.

**Solutions:**
1. Ask personal questions (appropriately): "How's [hobby]?"
2. Share about yourself. Model appropriate vulnerability.
3. Take some 1:1s outside (coffee, walk).
4. Be patient. Trust takes time.

### Challenge: They want to quit

**Symptom:** Disengaged, looking elsewhere.

**Solutions:**
1. Ask directly: "Are you thinking about leaving?"
2. Listen without defending: Why? What would change it?
3. Be honest about what you can and can't change.
4. If they're leaving, help them do it well.

### Challenge: You're too busy for 1:1s

**Symptom:** Frequent cancellations, rushed meetings.

**Reality check:**
- If you don't have time for 1:1s, you have too many direct reports
- Or you're not delegating enough
- Or your priorities are wrong

**1:1s are not optional.** They're core management work.
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Starting 1:1s with a New Report

**Input:**
> "I have a new direct report starting next week. How should I structure our first few 1:1s?"

**Output:**

## First 1:1s: New Direct Report Onboarding

### Week 1: Getting to Know You

**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Agenda:**

**Part 1: Your story (20 min)**
- "Tell me about your path to here."
- "What drew you to this role?"
- "What are you most excited about?"
- "What questions do you have?"

**Part 2: Working together (20 min)**
- "How do you like to receive feedback?"
- "What does great management look like to you?"
- "How do you prefer to communicate?"
- "What do you need from me to succeed?"

**Part 3: Context and questions (20 min)**
- Share team context and priorities
- Explain how 1:1s will work
- Answer their questions

**After the meeting:**
- Send notes summarizing what you learned
- Share resources they mentioned needing
- Schedule next 1:1

### Week 2-4: Frequent Check-Ins

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes (2x/week initially)

**Focus areas:**
- How's onboarding going?
- What's confusing?
- What do you need?
- Early wins to celebrate
- Course corrections

**Questions:**
- "What's surprised you so far?"
- "What's harder than expected? Easier?"
- "Who have you connected with?"
- "What do you wish you knew that you don't?"

### Week 4+: Establish Routine

**Transition to:**
- Weekly 1:1s (standard)
- Shared running doc for agenda
- Development topics added

**90-Day check-in:**
- How's it going overall?
- What's working? What's not?
- What do you want to focus on next quarter?
- Feedback both directions

---

### Example 2: Turning Around Unproductive 1:1s

**Input:**
> "My 1:1s have become boring status updates. Neither of us looks forward to them. How do I reset?"

**Output:**

## 1:1 Reset: From Status to Substance

### Diagnose the Problem

**Common causes:**
- No clear agenda ownership
- Habit of status reporting
- Lack of trust for deeper topics
- Manager talking too much
- No action coming from meetings

### The Reset Conversation

**In your next 1:1:**

"I want to talk about our 1:1s themselves. I've noticed they've
become mostly status updates, and I don't think we're getting
as much value as we could.

I want to use this time for things you can't get elsewhere—
career development, challenges you're facing, feedback, things
that are stuck. What would make these meetings more valuable
for you?"

**Listen. Take notes. Commit to change.**

### New Structure

**1. Implement a shared agenda doc**

```
## 1:1 Running Notes: [Name]

### This Week
[Their topics]
-
-

[Your topics]
-

### Notes
[Capture during meeting]

### Commitments
[ ] They will:
[ ] You will:

### Previous Weeks
[Archive old notes below]
```

**2. Change your opening question**

Old: "What's your update?"
New: "What's on your mind?"

**3. Add explicit time for development**

"Let's spend the last 10 minutes every week on your
development—skills, career, what you want to learn."

**4. Experiment with format**

- Take a walk
- Get coffee
- Change location
- Do a longer monthly instead of weekly (try temporarily)

### Week-to-Week Improvements

**Week 1:**
Announce the reset. Try new format.

**Week 2:**
Ask: "How did last week feel? What should we adjust?"

**Week 3:**
Start adding development topics.

**Week 4:**
Review: Is this working? What's missing?

### Example 3: Preparing for a Difficult 1:1

**Input:**
> "I need to address repeated missed deadlines with a direct report in our 1:1. They're generally good but this is becoming a pattern. How do I approach this?"

**Output:**

## Difficult 1:1: Addressing Missed Deadlines

### Before the 1:1

**Gather specifics:**
- List the missed deadlines (dates, projects)
- Note the impact of each
- Consider: Is there context you might be missing?

**Check your intent:**
- Am I trying to help them improve? ✓
- Am I coming in angry or punitive? (If yes, wait)

### In the 1:1

**Part 1: Open with care (2 min)**

"Hey [Name], I want to talk about something that's been on
my mind. It's coming from a place of wanting to see you
succeed here, so I want to be direct with you."

**Part 2: State the pattern (3 min)**

"I've noticed a pattern of missed deadlines:
- [Project A] was due [date], delivered [date]
- [Project B] was due [date], delivered [date]
- [Project C] was due [date], still outstanding

This is becoming a pattern, and I want to understand
what's going on."

**Part 3: Ask and listen (10 min)**

"Help me understand—what's happening?"

**Listen without interrupting.**

**Possible responses:**
- Overwhelm → Discuss workload, priorities
- Personal issues → Offer support, adjust if needed
- Skill gap → Identify training or support
- Didn't realize impact → Explain consequences
- Excuse/deflection → Gently redirect to pattern

**Part 4: Impact (3 min)**

"Here's why this matters:
- [Downstream impact]
- [Team/customer effect]
- [Your credibility/career]

I need this to change because [reason]."

**Part 5: Path forward (5 min)**

"What do you need to commit to realistic deadlines and hit them?"

Options to offer:
- Smaller scope
- Earlier escalation when at risk
- Buffer in estimates
- Different support

"Here's what I'll commit to: [support]"

**Part 6: Agreement (2 min)**

"So we're agreeing that:
- You will [specific commitment]
- I will [specific support]
- We'll check in on this in next two 1:1s

Does that feel fair?"

### After the 1:1

**Document:**
- What was discussed
- What was agreed
- Follow-up timeline

**Follow through:**
- Check in next 1:1
- Recognize progress
- Address backsliding immediately
