# Short-Form Video Production

## Purpose

This skill guides short-form video creation from concept through publication. It emphasizes practitioner methodology: fast prototyping, finding what works before building process, and "sponge then sharpen" creative philosophy.

**Core Philosophy:** You can't build a franchise system if you're not already selling a billion cheeseburgers. Find what works FIRST, then build process around it.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating original short-form video content (Reels, TikTok, Shorts)
- Cutting podcast clips for short-form distribution
- Developing video formats and testing new concepts
- Optimizing existing video content for better performance

**For captions and on-screen text only:** Use `video-caption-creation` skill instead.

## The Sponge-Then-Sharpen Method

### Phase 1: Sponge (Hunt for What Works)

Be malleable. Try different things. Stay loosey-goosey.

**In this phase:**
- Prototype fast (15 minutes max per video)
- Publish everything - "I don't have bad clips"
- Test multiple formats, hooks, styles
- Don't build systems yet
- Accept chaos as normal for creative work

**Warning signs you're stuck:**
- Working on one video for hours
- Building complex processes before proving format
- Perfectionism preventing publishing
- Over-investing in content that hasn't performed

### Phase 2: Sharpen (Triple Down on Winners)

Once something works, lock in and scale.

**In this phase:**
- Build process around proven format
- "I'm not gonna sleep and I'm gonna make 15,000 of these"
- Optimize the working format
- Create templates and systems
- Delegate production

**When to shift:** You've found a format that consistently gets views AND you could make it repeatedly.

---

## The 15-Minute Rule

**If you're working on short-form content for longer than 15 minutes, that's a warning sign.**

Short-form prototyping should be:
- Fast to create
- Cheap to fail
- Easy to iterate

Get it 90% good. The last 10% would take 2.5 hours - not worth it.

**Mindset:** You're a better editor than blank-page creator. Get the draft done, then evaluate.

## Hook Construction

### The McDonald's Test

> If a truck driver wouldn't understand your hook, it's too complicated.

- Accessible language beats impressive vocabulary
- "Stop raising entitled kids" > "Addressing entitlement in childhood development"
- Wider net = better performance

### The 3-Second Window

The first 1-3 seconds determine everything. Construct hooks that:
- Stop the scroll immediately
- Create curiosity or emotion
- Promise value without giving it away
- Pass the "would I stop for this?" test

### Hook Categories That Work

**1. Polarizing Statements**
- "George Washington was a screw-up"
- "Your kid's Minecraft addiction is genius"
- Challenge common assumptions

**2. Counter-Intuitive Reveals**
- "The worst experiences are the best teachers"
- "Don't try to limit screen time"
- Flip expected wisdom

**3. Direct Challenges**
- "If your kid hates school, please watch this"
- "Never give up on the weird kid"
- Speak directly to specific audience

**4. Curiosity Gaps**
- "The second person theory"
- "His kids skipped school for 100 days. Here's what happened."
- Incomplete information that demands resolution

**5. List Format**
- "5 dyslexia myths" (add ding + on-screen number)
- "3 reasons comedians make better marketers"
- Promise structure and takeaways

### Hook Optimization

**Punchline First:** Put the payoff at the beginning, not the end.
- "Don't hire a middle-aged man from Google - that's creepy. Hire me instead."
- Then explain how you got there

**No Satisfying Ending?** Add: "Check description for how she solved it"

**Same Video, Different Hooks:** Test the same content with different hooks - space them out over weeks.

## Producible Video Formats

### Tier 1: No Filming Required (Fastest)

**Split-Screen with Oddly Satisfying Footage**
- Top half: talking head or podcast clip
- Bottom half: laffy taffy machine, hot metal balls through foam, horse grooming ASMR
- Keeps lizard brain engaged while delivering content

**Text on B-Roll**
- Stock footage or screen recordings
- Text appears in succession
- Example: "Kids learn to walk at different ages..." [balls falling through foam] "...so why do we make every kid learn algebra at the same age?"

**Greenscreen Commentary**
- You pointing at/reacting to other content
- Co-signing valuable information
- Quick to produce once setup exists

**Podcast Clips (Monologue)**
- Single speaker with compelling insight
- Works best with well-spoken hosts in good visual environments
- Add color correction if needed

### Tier 2: Light Production

**Podcast Clips (Dialogue)**
- Back-and-forth creates energy
- Interview format with host reactions
- More engaging but harder to cut cleanly

**UGC-Style Talking Head**
- You speaking directly to camera
- Casual, authentic feel
- Can use AI restyle for characters (Instagram Edits → Restyle)

**Mashup/Supercut**
- Multiple clips combined around theme
- "5 different moms on their best homeschool tip"
- Requires library of source material

### Tier 3: Produced Content

**On-Location Footage**
- Your own B-roll with voiceover
- Requires shooting and editing time
- Higher quality but more friction

**Scripted UGC**
- Crowdsourced footage with guidelines
- Requires legal releases
- Can build library over time

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### YouTube Shorts
- 8+ minutes = additional ad breaks (algorithm may favor)
- Include #Shorts tag
- Thumbnail + title still matter for browse/search

### Instagram Reels
- 60 seconds is acceptable (but shorter usually better)
- Reels get 2-3x reach vs static posts
- Carousels mostly shown to existing audience
- Use Edits app for AI restyle features

### TikTok
- Can publish 4-5 times daily
- Clip compilations work (often backed by sponsorship deals)
- "I don't have bad clips, I publish everything" mindset

### Facebook Reels
- Comments drive algorithm reach
- Negative sentiment still boosts (algo doesn't distinguish)
- External links hurt reach in main post

---

## Title & Thumbnail (YouTube)

### Click-Through Rate Targets
- Below 4%: Low (fix title/thumbnail)
- 4-6%: Ideal range
- Above 6%: Excellent

### Thumbnail Principles

**Dial It to 11:** What's the most extreme version of this title?
- "Teacher lost control" → Show crying teacher with rambunctious kids

**Stock Photos > Illustrations:** Real photos with expressions work better

**Less Text, Higher Contrast:** "They ate me for lunch" → "They hate me"

**Show Expressive Faces:** If using guest, show reaction/emotion

### Title Principles

**Every Word After Hook Is a Filter:**
- "Five dyslexia myths every parent believes" (narrower)
- "Five dyslexia myths" (broader, more clicks)

**Universalize When Possible:** Make specific topics broadly appealing

**Direct Appeal Format:** "If your kid hates school, please watch this"

### Complementarity

Title and thumbnail should work together, not repeat:
- Title: "6 months with Ray-Ban Smart Glasses"
- Thumbnail text: "It has one problem"

### A/B Testing

Low views usually = bad packaging, not bad content. Try:
- Same video, different title
- Same video, different thumbnail
- Space tests out over weeks
- Revising months later can "restart" performance

## Content Pillars Strategy

Don't limit yourself to one format. Build multiple independent pillars:

| Pillar | Format | Hook Style |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Green Screen Commentary | You reacting to content | Direct commentary |
| Expert UGC | Moms sharing tips | Authentic testimony |
| Faceless B-Roll | Text on satisfying footage | Curiosity/insight |
| Podcast Clips | Monologue or dialogue | Storytelling |
| Historical/Educational | Illustrated or archival | Counter-intuitive reveals |

Each pillar has its own methodology. When one works, triple down on that pillar.

## Algorithm Optimization

### Triple Word Score

Stack four signals - algorithm indexes ALL:
1. **Audio transcript** (what's spoken)
2. **On-screen text** (captions, titles)
3. **Caption/description** (text below)
4. **Hashtags** (still matter)

### First 10 Seconds

Topic words must appear in:
- Audio (spoken explicitly)
- On-screen text (reinforcing, not competing)
- Visual context (environment matches topic)

### Caption Best Practices

- Less text on screen at a time
- Check mobile preview (desktop editing looks different)
- Match what successful podcast clips do
- Captions reinforce audio, don't compete with it

## Production Checklist

### Before Creating

- [ ] What format am I testing? (Tier 1/2/3)
- [ ] What's my hook? (passes McDonald's Test)
- [ ] Do I have all assets? (footage, audio, graphics)
- [ ] Time limit: 15 minutes max

### During Creation

- [ ] Hook appears in first 3 seconds
- [ ] Topic words spoken in first 10 seconds
- [ ] On-screen text readable on mobile
- [ ] Audio quality acceptable
- [ ] 90% good is good enough

### Before Publishing

- [ ] Triple Word Score complete
- [ ] Platform-specific requirements met
- [ ] Title/thumbnail complementary (YouTube)
- [ ] Caption written
- [ ] Hashtags appropriate for platform

### After Publishing

- [ ] Track performance (views, CTR, comments)
- [ ] If low views: consider title/thumbnail revision
- [ ] If it works: plan to make more of this format
- [ ] Don't delete - sometimes old content resurfaces

## Common Mistakes

**Production Mistakes:**
- Working too long on single video (break 15-min rule)
- Over-polishing before proving format works
- Building systems before finding winners
- Not publishing because it's "not good enough"

**Hook Mistakes:**
- Burying the lede (punchline should come first)
- Fancy vocabulary (fails McDonald's Test)
- Giving away payoff completely
- Hook doesn't match content (clickbait)

**Algorithm Mistakes:**
- Topic words not in first 10 seconds
- On-screen text competes with audio
- Inconsistent signals (audio says X, caption says Y)
- Same copy across all platforms

**Thumbnail/Title Mistakes:**
- Repeating same info in title and thumbnail
- Not extreme enough (dial to 11)
- Every word is a filter (too narrow)
- Giving up after one title fails (A/B test)
