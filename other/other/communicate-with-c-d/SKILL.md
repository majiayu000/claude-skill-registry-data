## Who is the CD?

CD types are questioning, skeptical, and deliberate. They combine the analytical precision of the C style with the results-driven determination of the D style -- rigorous analysts who also push for solutions. They don't just identify problems; they drive toward outcomes. They hold themselves and others to exceptionally high standards and aren't afraid to challenge those who fall short. Their skepticism makes them excellent at identifying flaws and improving systems.

## Do's

- Come prepared with data, thorough analysis, and well-reasoned arguments
- Get to the point quickly -- they value efficiency alongside thoroughness
- Be ready to defend your conclusions under logical questioning
- Focus on results, outcomes, and measurable impact
- Respect their expertise and competence
- Present conclusions first, then supporting evidence
- Be concise and precise in all communication
- Demonstrate competence through the quality of your work

## Don'ts

- Don't present sloppy or poorly-reasoned arguments
- Don't rely on emotional appeals or social pressure
- Don't waste their time with unnecessary meetings or small talk
- Don't take their probing questions as personal attacks
- Don't try to micromanage them or constrain their autonomy
- Don't expect warm, enthusiastic reactions -- they show engagement through questions
- Don't dismiss their high standards as being "too picky"
- Don't present consensus as evidence -- they want data, not popularity contests

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Come prepared with data and thorough analysis. Get to the point quickly -- CD types value efficiency. Be ready to defend your conclusions logically and don't take their probing questions personally. They engage most when the conversation is substantive and moving toward a decision.

### Email
Be concise, precise, and well-organized. Lead with conclusions, then provide supporting data. Include relevant evidence for any claims and avoid unnecessary pleasantries or filler. They respect communication that demonstrates you've done your homework.

### Giving Feedback
Be direct and specific with concrete examples. Focus on facts and measurable outcomes. Acknowledge their analytical contributions and the quality of their work before providing actionable improvement suggestions. They respect feedback that's as rigorous as their own standards.

### Resolving Conflict
Stick to logical arguments and evidence. Stay calm and avoid emotional appeals. Acknowledge valid points they make and focus on solving the problem together rather than assigning blame. They respect people who can argue their position logically without taking things personally.
