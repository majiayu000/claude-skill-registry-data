# TODO/FIXME Comments

Use TODO for planned improvements and FIXME for known issues. Include enough context: what needs to be done and why it wasn't done now. Consider adding ticket numbers or dates. Examples: "TODO: Extract to shared utility once we refactor auth module", "FIXME: Race condition when multiple requests hit simultaneously - tracked in JIRA-123". Track these in your issue tracker, not just in code.
