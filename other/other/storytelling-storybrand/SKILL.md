# StoryBrand Framework

> Master Donald Miller's 7-part StoryBrand framework from "Building a StoryBrand" (2017). Clarify your message so customers actually listen.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating or refining website messaging
- Writing brand narratives and marketing copy
- Building sales scripts and pitches
- Clarifying confusing product positioning
- Creating marketing one-liners
- Redesigning homepage and landing pages
- Training teams on consistent messaging

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: Donald Miller - "Building a StoryBrand" (2017)

**Core Principles**:
- "What we think we are saying to our customers and what our customers actually hear are two different things."
- "People don't buy the best products; they buy the products they can understand the fastest."
- "The customer is the hero, not your brand."

**The Two Fatal Mistakes**:
1. Focusing on the brand instead of how you help customers survive/thrive
2. Message is too complex for people to understand quickly

**Why Story Works**: Stories are the most powerful tool for organizing information. The human brain is wired for narrative. StoryBrand uses story structure to make marketing messages clear and compelling.

```

Product: [description]
Customer problem: [pain]
Our solution: [how we help]
```

## Instructions

When applying StoryBrand, work through the 7 plot points systematically:

### The SB7 Framework

```
## THE STORY FORMULA

A **CHARACTER** (who wants something)
has a **PROBLEM** (that they're struggling with)
and meets a **GUIDE** (who understands them)
who gives them a **PLAN** (clear steps to follow)
and **CALLS THEM TO ACTION** (challenges them to act)
that helps them **AVOID FAILURE** (shows the stakes)
and ends in **SUCCESS** (achieves transformation)

---

## 1. THE CHARACTER (Your Customer)

**Key Principle**: Your customer is the HERO of the story, NOT your brand.

**Fatal Mistake**: Most brands position themselves as the hero. ("We are the leading provider of..." "Our award-winning solution..." "Founded in 1985...")

**The Fix**: Define who your customer is and what they want.

**Questions to Answer**:
- Who is the hero of this story?
- What do they want as it relates to your product/service?
- How does this help them survive or thrive?

**Template**:
"A [customer type] who wants [specific desire]..."

**Examples**:
- "A busy executive who wants to look professional without spending time on style"
- "A startup founder who wants to grow without wasting money on ads that don't work"
- "A homeowner who wants a reliable contractor they can trust"

**Rules**:
- ONE clear desire (not multiple)
- Related to survival/thriving (safety, status, belonging, meaning, resources)
- Specific to your offering

---

## 2. THE PROBLEM

**Key Principle**: Problems drive stories. Define the villain and three levels of problem.

**The Villain**:
Every hero needs an obstacle. Define your villain—the source of the problem.

**Villain Rules**:
- Must be a root source of the problem
- Must be relatable (customers recognize it)
- Must be singular (one villain, not many)
- Must be real (not abstract)

**The Three Problem Levels**:

| Level | Definition | Example (Financial Advisor) |
|-------|------------|---------------------------|
| External | The tangible, surface problem | "I don't know how to invest" |
| Internal | How it makes them feel | "I feel stupid about money" |
| Philosophical | Why it's wrong/unjust | "I shouldn't have to be a finance expert to retire" |

**Miller's Insight**: "Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems."

**Template**:
```
Villain: [the root obstacle]
External Problem: [tangible issue]
Internal Problem: [how they feel]
Philosophical Problem: [why this is wrong]
```

**Example (Meal Delivery)**:
```
Villain: The chaos of modern life
External: "I don't have time to cook healthy meals"
Internal: "I feel guilty about feeding my family processed food"
Philosophical: "A busy schedule shouldn't mean compromising health"
```

---

## 3. THE GUIDE (Your Brand)

**Key Principle**: Your brand is the GUIDE, not the hero. Guides have "been there, done that."

**Fatal Mistake**: Competing with your customer for the hero role.

**The Fix**: Position yourself as the wise helper who enables the hero's success.

**Miller**: "If you focus on your customers' success, your own success will follow."

**Two Qualities of a Guide**:

### Empathy
Show you understand their pain.
- "We know how frustrating it is when..."
- "Like you, we've struggled with..."
- "We understand that..."

### Authority
Demonstrate competence and expertise.
- Testimonials
- Statistics
- Awards/logos
- Years of experience
- Case studies

**Balance Required**: Too much authority = arrogant. Too much empathy = weak. You need both.

**Template**:
"[Brand] understands [their pain] (empathy). With [credentials/proof], we've helped [results] (authority)."

**Example**:
"We know what it's like to watch hours disappear into your inbox. With 10 years helping executives reclaim their time, we've freed up over 1 million hours for leaders like you."

---

## 4. THE PLAN

**Key Principle**: Customers won't trust a guide without a plan. Plans remove confusion and fear.

**Two Types of Plans**:

### Process Plan (Removes Confusion)
Simple steps to do business with you.

**Rules**:
- 3-4 steps maximum
- Start with an action verb
- Name each step clearly
- End with the result

**Template**:
```
Step 1: [Action] → [Outcome]
Step 2: [Action] → [Outcome]
Step 3: [Action] → [Success]
```

**Example (Financial Advisor)**:
```
1. Schedule a free consultation
2. Receive a custom retirement plan
3. Start investing with confidence
```

**Example (SaaS)**:
```
1. Sign up for free trial
2. Connect your data in 5 minutes
3. Get insights that grow your business
```

### Agreement Plan (Removes Fear)
Promises and guarantees that lower perceived risk.

**Examples**:
- "Money-back guarantee"
- "No long-term contracts"
- "Free cancellation anytime"
- "Your data stays private"
- "We'll never share your information"

**Template**:
"We promise: [commitment 1], [commitment 2], [commitment 3]"

---

## 5. CALLS TO ACTION

**Key Principle**: Customers won't take action unless challenged to do so.

**Miller**: "Heroes need to be challenged by the guide to take action."

**Two Types of CTAs**:

### Direct CTA
The obvious main ask. Should be everywhere and obvious.

- "Buy Now"
- "Schedule a Call"
- "Get Started"
- "Sign Up Free"
- "Request a Quote"

**Rules**:
- Use a different color than the rest of the page
- Put it above the fold AND repeated throughout
- Use action verbs
- Be specific about what happens next

### Transitional CTA
Lower commitment. Builds trust for those not ready to buy.

- "Download Free Guide"
- "Watch Demo"
- "Take the Quiz"
- "Get Free Sample"
- "Subscribe to Newsletter"

**Rules**:
- Moves them further into the story
- Provides value in exchange for attention
- Less prominent than direct CTA
- Still clearly visible

**Website Rule**: Both CTAs should be visible in the header of every page.

---

## 6. AVOID FAILURE (Stakes)

**Key Principle**: Every story needs stakes. What will the hero lose if they don't act?

**Miller**: "Everyone wants to avoid a tragic ending."

**Questions to Answer**:
- What negative outcomes await if they don't use your solution?
- What will they continue to suffer?
- What's at risk?

**Balance Warning**: Create enough stakes to motivate, but don't overdo fear (looks manipulative).

**Template**:
"Without [solution], you risk [negative outcome 1], [negative outcome 2], and [negative outcome 3]."

**Examples**:
- "Without a proper email system, you'll keep losing 20 hours a week to inbox chaos"
- "Companies that don't adapt will be left behind by competitors"
- "Don't let another year go by without taking control of your finances"

**Subtle vs Overt**:
- Subtle: "Most businesses struggle with X for years before finding a solution"
- Overt: "Without action, you risk bankruptcy, burnout, and losing everything you've built"

Start subtle. Only go overt if subtle isn't motivating action.

---

## 7. SUCCESS (The Happy Ending)

**Key Principle**: Tell people exactly how you can improve their lives—don't assume they know.

**Miller**: "Tell people where you're taking them, or they won't follow."

**Three Ways to End the Story**:

### 1. Winning Power/Position
Status, influence, achievement, resources.

**Example**: "Become the go-to expert in your field"

### 2. Union That Makes Hero Whole
Community, belonging, completeness, partnership.

**Example**: "Join a community of 10,000 founders"

### 3. Self-Realization
Becoming who they were meant to be, reaching potential.

**Example**: "Finally become the leader your team deserves"

**Template**:
"With [solution], you'll [achievement], [feeling], and [transformation]."

**Example (Fitness)**:
"You'll have the energy to play with your kids, the confidence to tackle new challenges, and finally feel at home in your own body."

**Paint the Picture**:
- Use specific, sensory language
- Describe the after state in detail
- Make it aspirational but achievable
```

### Beyond the 7 Elements: Identity Transformation

```
## The Strongest Motivator

**Miller**: "Brands that participate in the identity transformation of their customers create passionate brand evangelists."

**Question**: Who does your customer want to BECOME?

**Before & After Identity**:

| Industry | Before Identity | After Identity |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Fitness | "Out of shape and embarrassed" | "Confident and strong" |
| Finance | "Confused about money" | "In control and secure" |
| SaaS | "Overwhelmed and behind" | "Efficient and ahead" |
| Coaching | "Stuck and unfulfilled" | "Clear and purposeful" |

**Template**:
"From [before identity] to [after identity]"

**Use In**:
- Testimonials: "Before/after" stories
- Marketing: "Join the [aspirational identity]"
- Community: Name for customers (e.g., "Achievers")
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Complete BrandScript (B2B SaaS)

**Business**: Project management software for creative agencies

```
## CHARACTER
Creative agency owners who want to deliver projects on time without micromanaging their team.

## PROBLEM
Villain: Chaos and miscommunication
External: Projects are constantly behind schedule
Internal: "I feel like a babysitter, not a leader"
Philosophical: Running an agency shouldn't mean drowning in admin

## GUIDE
Empathy: "We've worked with 500+ agencies who felt exactly like you—talented people buried in busywork."
Authority: "Our platform has helped deliver 50,000+ projects on time."

## PLAN
Process:
1. Connect your tools in 5 minutes
2. See all projects in one clear view
3. Deliver on time, every time

Agreement:
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- Free migration from your current tool
- No long-term contract

## CALL TO ACTION
Direct: "Start Free Trial"
Transitional: "See How It Works" (video demo)

## FAILURE
Without control, you'll keep missing deadlines, burning out your team, and losing clients to competitors who deliver.

## SUCCESS
- Win back 10+ hours per week
- Become the agency clients recommend
- Build a team that runs itself

## TRANSFORMATION
From: Overwhelmed agency owner drowning in chaos
To: Confident leader running a well-oiled machine
```

### Example 2: StoryBrand One-Liner

**The Formula**:
1. **The Problem** - Start with the problem
2. **The Solution** - Position your product as the solution
3. **The Result** - End with the success

**Template**:
"[Problem] is frustrating. [Product] helps [target] [solution] so they can [result]."

**Examples**:

**Marketing Agency**:
"Most small businesses struggle to get noticed online. Our marketing framework helps you clarify your message so customers actually listen and buy."

**Fitness App**:
"Getting in shape is hard when you don't have a plan. FitPath gives you a personalized workout and meal plan so you can transform your body in 90 days."

**Financial Advisor**:
"Retirement planning is confusing and stressful. We create simple, custom plans so you can retire with confidence."

**Accounting Software**:
"Spreadsheets waste hours and cause errors. CloudBooks automates your finances so you can focus on growing your business."

- Subhead: "Simple project management for teams tired of chaos" (problem → solution)
- Body:
  - Section 1: Problem (We know how frustrating missed deadlines are)
  - Section 2: Guide (Join 5,000+ teams who solved this)
  - Section 3: Plan (3 steps to get started)
  - Section 4: Success (What life looks like after)
