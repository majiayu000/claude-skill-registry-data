# GSD TDD Reference

Test-Driven Development patterns and practices.

## When to Use

- Writing new functionality
- Refactoring existing code
- Ensuring test coverage

## TDD Cycle

1. Red - Write failing test
2. Green - Make test pass
3. Refactor - Improve code

## Best Practices

- Write smallest test first
- Test one thing at a time
- Use descriptive test names
- Maintain fast test execution
- Achieve high coverage

## Success Criteria

Tests written before implementation, all passing.
