# API Documentation

Document each endpoint with: HTTP method and path, description, request parameters (path, query, body) with types, response format with examples, error codes and their meanings, authentication requirements. Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST APIs. Include runnable examples. Document rate limits and pagination. Keep docs in sync with code—consider generating from annotations or types.
