# Zed

Zed is a high-performance editor from the creators of Atom. Built in Rust with a GPU-accelerated UI. 2025 brings **Zeta** (Open Model AI) and **ACP** (Agent Client Protocol).

## When to Use

- **Performance**: It is significantly faster than VS Code. Opens 5GB logs instantly.
- **Collaboration**: "Multiplayer" is built-in. Share a link, code together like Google Docs.
- **Rust/Web Dev**: First-class support for these languages.

## Core Concepts

### Channel

A persistent chat room + coding session. Teams hang out in a Channel.

### GPUI

Rendered on the GPU. 120fps typing experience.

### Assistant Panel

Built-in chat with context. Can use OpenAI, Anthropic, or Ollama (local models).

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use Vim Mode**: Zed's Vim emulation is excellent and getting better.
- **Edit Remote**: Use `ssh` remote editing which is buttery smooth compared to VS Code.
- **Bind AI**: Map `Command-Enter` to send to assistant.

**Don't**:

- **Don't expect every Extension**: The extension ecosystem is growing but strictly smaller than VS Code's.
