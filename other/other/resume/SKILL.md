## Instructions

When this skill is invoked with an album name:

### Step 1: Find the Album via MCP

1. Call `find_album(name)` — fuzzy match by name, slug, or partial (case-insensitive)
2. If not found: MCP returns available albums — suggest closest match or `/bitwize-music:new-album`
3. If multiple matches: list all with paths, ask user which one
4. If MCP returns stale/missing cache error: call `rebuild_state()` then retry

### Step 2: Get Album Progress

1. Call `get_album_progress(album_slug)` — returns track counts by status, completion percentage, and detected workflow phase
2. Call `list_tracks(album_slug)` — returns per-track details (status, has_suno_link, sources_verified)

### Step 3: Update Session Context

Call `update_session(album=album_slug, phase=detected_phase)` to set the active album and phase.

### Step 4: Determine Current Phase

Based on album and track statuses, identify the workflow phase:

| Album Status | Track Statuses | Current Phase |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Concept | Most "Not Started" | Planning - Need to fill in album README and create tracks |
| In Progress | Mixed, some "Not Started" | Writing - Need to complete lyrics |
| In Progress | Some "Sources Pending" | Verification - Need human verification of sources |
| In Progress | All have lyrics | Ready to Generate - Run Ready to Generate checkpoint |
| In Progress | Some "Generated" | Generating - Continue generating on Suno |
| Complete | All "Final" | Mastering - Ready to master audio |
| Released | All "Final" | Released - Album is live |

### Step 5: Report to User

Present a clear status report:

```
📁 Album: [Album Title]
   Location: {content_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/
   Status: [Album Status]

📊 Progress:
   - Tracks: [X completed / Y total]
   - Not Started: X
   - In Progress: Y
   - Generated: Z
   - Final: N

📍 Current Phase: [Phase Name]

✅ What's Done:
   - [List completed items]

⏭️ Next Steps:
   1. [Specific action 1]
   2. [Specific action 2]
   3. [Specific action 3]

Ready to continue? Tell me what you'd like to work on.
```

### Step 6: Recommend the Single Best Next Action

Pick ONE clear recommendation from the decision tree below. Don't list 5 options — pick the best one, include the skill name, and be specific about which track.

**Decision Tree** (evaluate top-to-bottom, first match wins):

```
Album Status = "Concept"
  → "Define the album concept. Run /bitwize-music:album-conceptualizer"

Album Status = "Research Complete"
  → Any tracks Sources Pending?
    YES → "Sources need verification. Run /bitwize-music:verify-sources [album]"
    NO  → "Ready to write! Pick a track and use /bitwize-music:lyric-writer"

Album has tracks with "Not Started"
  → "Write lyrics for [first not-started track]. Use /bitwize-music:lyric-writer"

Album has tracks with "In Progress" (lyrics partially written)
  → "Finish lyrics for [first in-progress track]. Use /bitwize-music:lyric-writer"

Album has tracks with "Sources Pending"
  → "Verify sources for [track]. Run /bitwize-music:verify-sources [album]"

All tracks have lyrics, none generated
  → "All lyrics complete! Style prompts should be ready. Run /bitwize-music:pronunciation-specialist to check for pronunciation risks, then /bitwize-music:lyric-reviewer for final QC, then /bitwize-music:pre-generation-check to validate all gates before generating on Suno."

Some tracks generated, some not
  → "Generate [first un-generated track] on Suno. Use /bitwize-music:suno-engineer"

All tracks generated
  → "All tracks generated! Import audio with /bitwize-music:import-audio, then master with /bitwize-music:mastering-engineer"

Album Status = "Complete"
  → "Album is complete! Release with /bitwize-music:release-director"

Album Status = "Released"
  → "This album is released! Consider /bitwize-music:promo-director for promotional content"
  → Also suggest: "Start a new album? Check /bitwize-music:album-ideas list"
```

**Format the recommendation as:**
```
RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTION:
  [Clear, specific instruction with skill name and track name]

WHY:
  [One sentence explaining why this is the right next step]
```

### When No Album Specified (No Arguments)

If invoked without an album name:
1. Call `get_session()` — check `last_album` from session context, resume that album
2. If no session context, call `list_albums()` to find all in-progress albums
3. Prioritize: closest to completion > unblocked work > last worked on
4. If no albums exist, suggest `/bitwize-music:new-album`

Present a multi-album summary if multiple are in progress:
```
You have X albums. Here's the most actionable:

PRIORITY 1: [album-name] ([genre])
  Status: [status] | Progress: [X/Y tracks]
  → [Recommended action]

Also in progress:
  - [album-2] — [brief status]
```

```

### Example 2: Album Ready for Generation

```
/bitwize-music:resume demo-album

✅ What's Done:
   - All 8 tracks have complete lyrics
   - All lyrics phonetically reviewed
   - Suno Style and Lyrics boxes filled

⏭️ Next Steps:
   1. Run Ready to Generate checkpoint (I'll verify everything)
   2. Start generating on Suno
   3. Log generation attempts

Shall I run the Ready to Generate checkpoint now?
```

### Example 3: Album Not Found

```
/bitwize-music:resume my-album

❌ Album 'my-album' not found.

Available albums:
- demo-album (electronic) - In Progress
- example-tracks (hip-hop) - Complete

Did you mean one of these? Or use /bitwize-music:new-album to create a new album.
```

## Implementation Notes

- **Use MCP tools** - `find_album`, `get_album_progress`, `list_tracks`, `update_session` instead of reading state.json directly
- **Case-insensitive matching** - "Sample-Album" should match "sample-album"
- **Handle missing albums gracefully** - List what exists, don't error
- **Be specific about next steps** - Don't just say "continue working", say exactly what to do
- **Include full paths** - User needs to know where files are located
- **Use emojis sparingly** - Only for section headers in the report

---

## Model

Use **Sonnet 4.5** - This is a coordination/reporting task, not creative work.
