- Balance quantitative and qualitative information

### 5. Balance Transparency with Tact
- Be honest about challenges and setbacks
- Frame problems with potential solutions
- Acknowledge uncertainty when appropriate

See `references/workflows.md` for complete incident communication framework.

## Tone and Style Guidelines

### Professional Yet Approachable
**Do**: Use conversational but clear language, write like you speak (but edited), show personality within bounds.

**Don't**: Use corporate jargon or buzzwords, write in overly formal language, sacrifice clarity for cleverness.

**Example**:
- ❌ "We are pleased to announce that the strategic initiative has reached its preliminary milestone."
- ✅ "Great news! We've hit our first major milestone on the customer portal redesign."

### Transparency and Authenticity
**Do**: Share both good news and challenges, admit when you don't know something, explain the reasoning behind decisions.

**Don't**: Spin bad news into forced positivity, hide problems until they're critical, exaggerate accomplishments.

### Inclusive Language
**Do**: Use gender-neutral language, avoid idioms that don't translate well, be mindful of cultural differences, consider time zones for global teams.

**Don't**: Use unnecessarily gendered language, use phrases like "obviously" or "simply", reference culture-specific events only.

### Action-Oriented Messaging
**Do**: Use active voice, start with verbs, make requests specific, set clear deadlines, define ownership.

**Don't**: Use passive voice excessively, be vague about expectations, leave actions unassigned.

**Example**:
- ❌ "A decision needs to be made about the framework."
- ✅ "Sarah, please decide which framework we're using by Friday."

### Appropriate Formality by Context
**Formal** (All-hands, policy changes): Complete sentences, professional tone, minimal emoji.

**Semi-Formal** (Status reports, team updates): Conversational but professional, personality appropriate, occasional emoji.

**Informal** (Slack, quick updates): Conversational and brief, emoji and GIFs appropriate, fragments acceptable.
