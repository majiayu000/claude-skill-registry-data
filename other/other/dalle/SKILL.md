# DALL-E 3 / 4

DALL-E is OpenAI's image model. It excels at **Prompt Adherence**—it draws exactly what you ask for, including complex text.

## When to Use

- **ChatGPT Integration**: "Draw a diagram of..." inside a chat flow.
- **Complex Instructions**: "A cat holding a sign that says 'Hello World'".
- **Safety**: Strict guardrails against NSFW/Copyright.

## Core Concepts

### Integration

Available via OpenAI API (`dall-e-3`) and ChatGPT.

### Editing

In ChatGPT, you can select an area of the image and say "Make the cat blue".

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use via ChatGPT**: The conversational refinement is its superpower.
- **Ask for JSON**: The API can return the image or a revised prompt.

**Don't**:

- **Don't expect photorealism**: It often has a "plastic" or "smooth" look compared to Midjourney.
