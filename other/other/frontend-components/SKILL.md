name: Frontend Components
description: Build reusable, composable UI components with single responsibilities, clear prop interfaces, proper state management, and minimal coupling. Use this skill when creating or editing React components (.tsx, .jsx files), when designing component APIs with props, when implementing component composition patterns, when managing local component state, when building shadcn/ui components, when creating shared UI components in resources/js/Components/, when implementing component documentation, or when refactoring large components into smaller, focused pieces.

# Frontend Components

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle frontend components.

## When to use this skill

- When creating new React components in `.tsx` or `.jsx` files
- When editing existing components in `resources/js/Components/` or similar directories
- When designing component prop interfaces and TypeScript types
- When implementing component composition by combining smaller components
- When managing component state (useState, useReducer, etc.)
- When building or customizing shadcn/ui components
- When creating reusable UI components (buttons, cards, modals, forms, etc.)
- When refactoring monolithic components into smaller, focused pieces
- When implementing component documentation or usage examples
- When deciding between local state and lifting state up to parent components
- When defining component naming conventions
- When encapsulating component internal logic and exposing minimal APIs
