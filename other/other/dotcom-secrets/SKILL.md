| **Source** | DotCom Secrets (2015, updated 2020) |

## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

This skill transforms your approach to online sales by replacing scattered marketing tactics with a systematic funnel architecture.

Instead of driving traffic to a generic website, you'll create focused conversion paths that:
1. Capture attention with irresistible "bait"
2. Convert visitors into subscribers (traffic you own)
3. Qualify buyers with low-ticket offers
4. Ascend customers through increasingly valuable offers
5. Maximize lifetime value with backend products

The result: predictable customer acquisition costs, higher profit margins, and the ability to scale through paid advertising.

## How to Use

### Prompt Examples

```
Design a complete sales funnel for my [product/service] targeting [audience].
Include the value ladder, funnel type selection, and page sequence.
```

```
Write a Soap Opera email sequence (5 emails) to nurture new subscribers
for my [business type]. Use the DotCom Secrets framework.
```

```
Create a Perfect Webinar script outline for selling my $997 [course/program]
to [target audience]. Include the 3 secrets structure.
```

```

```

```
Design order form bumps and upsell sequence for my [product]
to maximize average order value.
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Define Your Secret Formula

Answer these four questions before building any funnel:

**1. Who is your dream customer?**
- Demographics, psychographics, behaviors
- Their hopes, fears, struggles, desires
- Create a vivid avatar with a real photo

**2. Where do they congregate?**
- Facebook groups, forums, podcasts
- Influencers they follow
- Newsletters they read
- Search: "keyword + forum"

**3. What bait will attract them?**
- Free report, ebook, webinar, quiz
- Must match their specific desires
- Valuable enough to exchange email

**4. What result will you deliver?**
- Focus on transformation, not features
- Specific, measurable outcomes
- The "after" state they desire

### Step 2: Build Your Value Ladder

Design offerings at each price tier:

```
BACKEND ($2,000+)
├── Done-for-you services
├── High-ticket coaching
├── Mastermind groups
├── Live events
│
MIDDLE ($100-$2,000)
├── Online courses
├── Group coaching
├── Workshops
├── Software subscriptions
│
FRONTEND ($7-$97)
├── Ebooks
├── Mini-courses
├── Templates
├── Low-ticket offers
│
BAIT ($0)
├── Lead magnets
├── Free webinars
├── Quizzes
├── Free + shipping offers
```

**Rule**: Each step provides 10x more value than the previous.

### Step 3: Select Funnel Type

Match funnel to traffic temperature and price point:

| Traffic | Price | Funnel Type |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Cold | Free-$47 | Free + Shipping, Tripwire |
| Cold/Warm | $47-$97 | Self-Liquidating Offer (SLO) |
| Warm | $100-$2,000 | Webinar, VSL |
| Warm | $200-$2,000 | Product Launch |
| Hot | $2,000+ | Application + Phone |

---

### Step 4: Create Funnel Pages

**Frontend Funnel Structure:**
1. **Ad/Traffic Source** →
2. **Squeeze Page** (collect email) →
3. **Sales Page** (frontend offer) →
4. **Order Form** (with bump) →
5. **OTO 1** (upsell) →
6. **OTO 2** (upsell/downsell) →
7. **Thank You Page** (next funnel teaser)

**Key Elements per Page:**
- ONE clear goal per page
- Hook in headline
- Story that builds connection
- Irresistible offer with Stack
- Urgency/scarcity
- Clear CTA

---

### Step 5: Write Email Sequences

**Soap Opera Sequence (New Subscribers):**

| Day | Email | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 0 | Set the Stage | Welcome, set expectations |
| 1 | High Drama | Start with exciting moment |
| 2 | Epiphany | Share breakthrough discovery |
| 3 | Hidden Benefits | Unexpected advantages |
| 4 | Urgency + CTA | Create deadline, ask for action |

**Daily Seinfeld Emails (Ongoing):**
- 90% entertainment, 10% content
- Share daily observations/stories
- ALWAYS tie back to an offer
- Keep Attractive Character top of mind

---

### Step 6: Apply Sales Scripts

**For Low-Ticket (Who/What/Why/How):**
1. Who you are
2. What you're offering
3. Why they need it
4. How to get it
5. Address "the catch"
6. Add urgency
7. Guarantee
8. Recap

**For Mid-Ticket (Perfect Webinar):**
1. Big Promise + Hook to End
2. Qualify yourself
3. The One Thing (core concept)
4. Secret #1 (destroy myth)
5. Secret #2 (destroy myth)
6. Secret #3 (destroy myth)
7. The Stack (pile on value)
8. If/All close
9. Reveal price
10. Guarantee + Scarcity
11. CTA

---

### Step 7: Optimize with Upsells

**Order Form Bump:**
- Checkbox offer after credit card, before submit
- Complementary product, ~$37-$47
- "Add [X] to your order for just $37"

**One-Time Offers (OTOs):**
- OTO 1: More of same OR done-faster solution
- OTO 2: Related product OR payment plan
- OTO 3 (optional): High-ticket application

**Downsell Strategy:**
- If they decline OTO, offer payment plan
- Or offer lighter version at lower price
