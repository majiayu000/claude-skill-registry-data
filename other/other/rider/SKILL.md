# Rider

Rider is JetBrains' .NET IDE. It is faster than Visual Studio 2022 in many cases and runs on Mac/Linux. It works great for **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**.

## When to Use

- **Game Dev**: Best Unity/Unreal integration on the market.
- **Cross-Platform .NET**: Developing ASP.NET Core on macOS.
- **Performance**: ReSharper engine process runs out-of-process, keeping typing smooth.

## Core Concepts

### ReSharper

The analysis engine powering Rider. 2000+ code inspections.

### Solution Explorer

Standard .NET project view.

### Decompiler

Built-in IL decompiler allows you to view source of closed-source libraries.

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use Unity Mode**: Special tool windows for Unity logs and gameplay debugging.
- **Use Dynamic Program Analysis**: Finds memory leaks and allocations while you run the app.
- **Hot Reload**: Supports .NET Hot Reload for rapid iteration.

**Don't**:

- **Don't ignore hints**: Rider enables "Solution Wide Analysis". If it's green, it compiles.
