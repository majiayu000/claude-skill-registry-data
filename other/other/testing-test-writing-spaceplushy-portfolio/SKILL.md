name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write strategic, behavior-focused tests for core user flows and critical functionality using Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for end-to-end testing. Use this skill when writing test files, testing utilities, or implementing test coverage for critical paths. When working on Vitest test files (.test.ts, .spec.ts), Playwright E2E test suites, test setup and configuration files (vitest.config.ts, test-setup.ts), mock implementations for external dependencies, testing utility functions or test helpers, component test files using React Testing Library, API route test files, or integration tests for Content Collections and data fetching logic.

# Testing Test Writing

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.

## When to use this skill

- When writing Vitest unit tests for utilities, components, or business logic
- When creating Playwright E2E tests for critical user workflows
- When testing API routes and server-side logic
- When implementing mocks for external dependencies (APIs, databases, file systems)
- When testing Content Collection queries and data transformations
- When writing integration tests for data fetching logic
- When setting up test configurations (vitest.config.ts, test-setup.ts)
- When using React Testing Library for component testing
- When focusing tests on behavior rather than implementation details
- When writing clear, descriptive test names that explain expected outcomes
- When prioritizing tests for core user flows over edge cases during development
