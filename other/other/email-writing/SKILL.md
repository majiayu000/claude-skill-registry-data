# Email Writing

> Master email marketing from subject lines to sequences. Templates for welcome emails, nurture campaigns, sales emails, and newsletters that get opened, read, and clicked.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing email subject lines that get opens
- Creating welcome email sequences
- Building nurture and sales sequences
- Writing newsletters that engage
- Re-engagement and win-back campaigns
- Reviewing and improving email performance

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: Compiled from Copyhackers, Really Good Emails, Val Geisler, Joanna Wiebe, and direct response email best practices.

**Core Principle**: Email is a conversation, not a broadcast. Every email should feel like it came from a person, provide value, and respect the inbox.

**Why This Matters**: Email still delivers the highest ROI of any channel ($36 for every $1 spent). But only if it gets opened, read, and clicked.

```

```

## Instructions

When writing emails, apply these frameworks:

### Subject Line Mastery

```
## Subject Line Formulas That Work

### Category 1: Curiosity
Create a gap between what they know and want to know

**Formulas:**
- "[Unexpected thing] about [topic]"
- "I was wrong about [topic]"
- "This changes everything"
- "Quick question"
- "Weird thing happened..."

**Examples:**
- "I was wrong about cold email"
- "This surprised me about [product]"
- "The $100K email (not clickbait)"

---

### Category 2: Benefit/Value
Promise clear value for opening

**Formulas:**
- "[Number] ways to [achieve outcome]"
- "How to [achieve result]"
- "The [adjective] way to [do thing]"
- "[Resource] inside"

**Examples:**
- "7 ways to fix your landing page"
- "Your [Month] marketing calendar is ready"
- "The lazy way to write better emails"

---

### Category 3: Personal/Conversational
Feels like it came from a person

**Formulas:**
- "Quick question about [topic]"
- "Thoughts on [topic]?"
- "This made me think of you"
- "Re: [previous topic]" (use sparingly)

**Examples:**
- "Quick question about your goals"
- "Thoughts on this approach?"
- "Made me think of you"

---

### Category 4: Urgency/Scarcity
Time-sensitive (only if genuine)

**Formulas:**
- "[X] hours left"
- "Last chance: [offer]"
- "Closing [timeframe]"
- "Before you miss this"

**Examples:**
- "24 hours left (then price goes up)"
- "Closing at midnight"
- "Last call for [offer]"

---

### Category 5: List/Story
Promise organized content

**Formulas:**
- "[Number] [things] you need to [outcome]"
- "A story about [topic]"
- "How I [achieved result]"

**Examples:**
- "3 emails that made us $50K"
- "A story about my worst launch"
- "How we fixed our churn problem"

---

## Subject Line Power Words

**Open-Boosters:**
- Quick, Fast, Easy
- New, Now, Today
- How, Why, What
- You, Your
- Free, Save
- [Numbers]

**Spam-Triggers to Avoid:**
- FREE!!! (all caps + exclamation)
- URGENT!!!
- Act now!!!
- Buy now
- Click here
- Too many emojis
```

---

### Email Body Structure

```
## The Anatomy of a High-Performing Email

### Opening Line (The Hook)
- First 1-2 sentences determine if they read on
- NO "Hope this finds you well"
- Start with curiosity, story, or direct value

**Good Opens:**
- "I made a mistake last week."
- "Quick question for you:"
- "You asked for this, so here it is."
- "[Name], I noticed something about your [X]..."
- Direct statement of value

**Bad Opens:**
- "Hope this email finds you well!"
- "Just checking in..."
- "I wanted to reach out because..."
- "As per my last email..."

---

### Body (The Value)
- One idea per email (focused)
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences max)
- White space is your friend
- Write for mobile (52% open on mobile)
- Use bold for emphasis sparingly
- Bullets for lists

**Reading Length Guidelines:**
- Newsletter: 200-400 words
- Sales email: 150-300 words
- Welcome email: 150-250 words
- Promotional: 100-200 words

---

### CTA (The Action)
- One primary CTA per email
- Make it button or obvious link
- Tell them exactly what happens when they click
- CTA above and below long emails

**CTA Templates:**
- "Click here to [get specific thing]"
- "Grab your [offer] →"
- "[Action verb] now →"
- "Reply and let me know"

---

### Signature (The Close)
- Consistent, personal sign-off
- Photo optional but humanizing
- Keep it short
- P.S. line for second pitch (optional but effective)
```

---

### Email Performance Optimization

```
## What to Track

### Primary Metrics
- **Open Rate**: Subject line effectiveness
  - Industry avg: 15-25%
  - Good: 25%+

- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Content + CTA effectiveness
  - Industry avg: 2-4%
  - Good: 4%+

- **Conversion Rate**: Overall email effectiveness
  - Varies by goal

### Improvement Strategies

**Low Open Rate (< 15%)**
- Test subject lines (A/B test)
- Check sender name (person vs. company)
- Review send time
- Clean your list (remove cold)
- Check deliverability

**High Open, Low Click (< 2%)**
- Email too long
- CTA not clear/visible
- Content/CTA mismatch
- Wrong audience segment
- Weak value proposition

**High Click, Low Conversion**
- Landing page issue
- Expectation mismatch
- Too many steps after click
- Wrong audience in sequence

### A/B Test Ideas
1. Subject line (curiosity vs. direct)
2. Send time (morning vs. afternoon)
3. CTA button vs. text link
4. Email length (short vs. long)
5. Personal vs. branded sender
6. With image vs. text only
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Welcome Email

**Context**: SaaS trial signup welcome

**Output**:

```
Subject: Your account is ready (+ quick tip)

Hey [Name],

Welcome to [Product].

Your account is ready to go: [Login Link]

But before you dive in, here's the #1 thing I wish someone told me when I started:

**Don't try to do everything at once.**

Start with [one key feature]. It takes 5 minutes and you'll see the value immediately.

Here's exactly how to set it up:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

That's it. Once you've done that, you'll be ahead of 80% of new users.

Questions? Reply to this email—I actually read them.

P.S. I'll send you a few more tips over the next week. They're short and useful, promise.

### Example 2: Sales Email Sequence

**Context**: B2B software, demo booking goal

**Email 1 of 5**:

```
Subject: The spreadsheet problem

[Name],

Every Monday, you probably do the same thing.

Open the spreadsheet. Wait for it to load. Scroll through 47 tabs. Spend 20 minutes finding the number you need.

And by the time you find it, it's already outdated.

Sound familiar?

That's because spreadsheets weren't built for [specific use case]. They're where good data goes to die.

Tomorrow, I'll show you what happens when you ditch the spreadsheet.

Until then,
[Sign-off]
```

**Email 2 of 5**:

```
Subject: Ditch the spreadsheet

[Name],

Yesterday I mentioned the spreadsheet problem.

Today, the solution: [Product Name].

Instead of 47 tabs and outdated data, you get:
- Real-time [specific data] in one dashboard
- Updates that sync automatically
- Reports that take seconds, not hours

[Customer Name] at [Company] made the switch 6 months ago.

Results: "We got 3 hours back every week. And our numbers are actually accurate now."

Worth 15 minutes to see if it'd work for you?

No pitch. Just a look at your data and whether we can help.

### Example 3: Newsletter

**Context**: Marketing newsletter for B2B audience

**Output**:

```
Subject: We killed our best-performing email

Hey,

Our welcome sequence was converting at 12%.

Last month, we deleted it and started over.

Here's why:

The sequence was 18 months old. Our product had changed. Our positioning had changed. But our first impression hadn't.

New subscribers were getting promises we no longer make.

It was converting—but to the wrong people.

**The lesson**: High performance isn't everything. Performance aligned with where you're going matters more.

We're still A/B testing the new sequence. Early signs: 8% conversion but 40% lower churn at 30 days.

Worth it.

**This week's links:**
- The 5 emails every SaaS needs (our framework) [Link]
- Why your free trial converts worse than it should [Link]
- Tool I'm testing for email analytics [Link]

Until next week,
[Sign-off]

P.S. Building your own sequence? Reply and I'll send you our new template (not published yet).
