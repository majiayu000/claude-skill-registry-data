# Personal Growth Framework

A systematic approach to self-improvement through pattern recognition and structured reflection.

## Workflow

1. **Identify patterns**: Review recent experiences. What recurring situations, behaviors, or outcomes do you notice?

2. **Analyze strengths**: What's working well? Which approaches consistently succeed? What natural talents emerge?

3. **Spot improvement areas**: Where do you struggle repeatedly? What skills need development? What habits hold you back?

4. **Understand context**: When do challenges occur? What triggers them? What environmental factors matter?

5. **Design experiments**: Choose one small change to test. Make it specific and measurable. Set a timeframe.

6. **Track progress**: Document what happens. Note what works and what doesn't. Adjust based on evidence.

7. **Iterate**: Build on successes. Learn from failures. Repeat the cycle with new experiments.

## Core Principles

- **Evidence-based**: Base improvements on observed patterns, not assumptions
- **Incremental**: Small, consistent changes beat dramatic overhauls
- **Contextual**: What works depends on your situation and goals
- **Iterative**: Growth is continuous experimentation and refinement

## Key Principle

**Self-improvement is pattern recognition + systematic experimentation.** Observe yourself objectively, identify patterns, test changes, and refine based on results.
