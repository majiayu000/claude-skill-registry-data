# Social Media Content Creator

## Purpose

This skill transforms any source material into high-performing social media posts using the **framework fitting method**: extract standalone concepts, match to proven templates, generate volume, select best, execute, and proliferate winners.

**Key Philosophy:** Content creation isn't about constantly coming up with new ideas. It's about turning 1 idea into 1000 variations using proven frameworks.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Repurpose newsletter content into social posts
- Transform long-form articles into multi-platform campaigns
- Create LinkedIn posts from any concept or story
- Generate multiple post options quickly
- Multiply high-performing posts using SCAMPER, Human Desires, or Vision/Anti-Vision reframing

**Do NOT use for:**
- Short-form video captions (use `video-caption-creation` skill instead)
- Podcast-specific clip selection (separate podcast workflow)

## The Framework Fitting Method

### Core Principle
Good content follows proven formats/frameworks/templates. The skill is in **framework fitting** - matching concepts to the delivery mechanisms that amplify them best.

### Critical Rule: Avoid First-Match Bias
**Do NOT default to the first template that seems to fit.**

> "Analyze, Then Select" - Treat template selection as a distinct step. Read and consider ALL applicable frameworks before selecting.

The best framework might not be the obvious one.

### Critical Rule: Avoid AI Tells
**Never use formatting that screams "AI wrote this."**

Common AI tells to avoid in social posts:
- **Arrow bullets** (→, ➡️, ▸) - Use plain dashes, numbers, or line breaks instead
- **Emoji bullets** as list markers
- **"Here's the thing:"** or **"Let me explain:"** throat-clearing
- **Staccato fragments:** "No fluff. No filler. Just results."
- **Correlative constructions:** "It's not about X - it's about Y"

Write like a human would text a friend, not like a bot formatting a listicle.

## The 4-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Extract Standalone Concepts

**Goal:** Identify the most shareable "standalone" concepts from source material

#### Step 1: Read Source Material Thoroughly
- Full newsletter, article, or podcast transcript
- Look for bundles of ideas within their context
- Self-contained insights that can live independently

#### Step 2: Extract Concepts
For each standalone concept, capture:
- **Core Insight** (1-2 sentences)
- **Context Needed** (what background info is required?)
- **Emotion/Value** (what does this unlock for the reader?)
- **Human Desire(s)** (which of the 8 desires does this address?)
- **Potential Angles** (initial framework ideas)

**How Many Concepts to Extract:**
- Newsletter segment: 1-3 concepts per segment
- Full newsletter: 5-10 concepts total
- Long-form article: 5-15 concepts
- Podcast episode: 3-8 concepts (plus video clips handled separately)

#### Step 3: Create Concepts Document

Create file: `[Source]_Concepts.md`

**Example format:**

```markdown
# Microschools Article - Extracted Concepts

## Concept 1: Policy Failure → Grassroots Success
**Core Insight:** Nevada's ESA program was blocked by courts in 2015, but families created 95,000 microschools anyway. Sometimes policy losses create space for something better.

**Context:** Grant Hewitt's experience working on Nevada ESA, subsequent grassroots movement

**Emotion/Value:** Empowerment, autonomy, resilience, "you don't need permission"

**Human Desires:** Freedom From Fear, Survival & Success

**Potential Angles:** Before/After, Pattern Recognition, Failure Story, Reverse Framing

---

## Concept 2: Credentials vs Community
**Core Insight:** Most successful microschool founders don't start with teaching credentials. They start with community. About half of Prenda's guides are parents without credentials.

**Context:** Dalena Wallace (3 families → 16 students), Kelly Smith (Prenda founder), Jon England stories

**Emotion/Value:** Permission, accessibility, "you can do this"

**Human Desires:** Social Acceptance, Comfort & Clarity, Safety of Tribe

**Potential Angles:** Pattern Recognition, Contrarian Truth, What If It Was Simpler

[Continue for all extracted concepts...]
```

**Reference for this phase:**
- `Frameworks/Basic Context/OpenEd Identity Framework.md` (alignment check)
- `references/human-desires-guide.md` (8 desires)

---

### Phase 2: Framework Matching (THE CRITICAL PHASE)

**Goal:** Match extracted concepts to best-fit frameworks using volume generation → selection

#### The Framework Matching Process

**For each concept:**

1. **Brainstorm First:** How COULD this concept be presented?
   - Think beyond the obvious
   - Consider different platforms
   - Imagine different emotional angles

2. **Review ALL Applicable Frameworks:**
   - LinkedIn templates (86+ options)
   - Text post structures (100+ options)
   - Don't stop at first match
   - Consider at least 5-10 frameworks minimum

3. **Test the Fit:**
   - Does concept naturally fit framework structure?
   - What would make this concept fit BETTER in another framework?
   - Which framework amplifies the core emotion/value most?

4. **Generate Volume:**
   - **Quick social plan:** 2-4 framework matches per concept
   - **High-volume campaign:** 10-20 framework matches per concept
   - **Article repurposing:** 7-10 total posts across all concepts

5. **Select Best:**
   - Which frameworks amplify the concept most?
   - Which platforms matter most for this content?
   - Which formats are most efficient to execute?

#### Step 1: Review Template Libraries

**LinkedIn Templates** (`references/linkedin-frameworks.md`):
- 86 templates from LinkedIn Swipe File
- 50 templates from Justin Welsh
- Best for: Thought leadership, educational content, stories

**Text Post Structures** (`references/post-structures.md`):
- 100+ proven tweet/post frameworks
- Best for: X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram captions
- Includes: Comparisons, Lists, Challenges, Observations, Analogies

#### Step 2: Generate Framework Matches

Create file: `[Source]_Framework_Matches.md`

**For each concept, document:**

```markdown
## Concept: "Credentials vs Community"

### Framework Matches Generated (10 total):

**1. Pattern Recognition Template** (LinkedIn Swipe File #48)
- **Fit Assessment:** ✅ STRONG
- **Why it fits:** Clear pattern of successful founders starting with community
- **Structure:** "I've noticed a pattern: [Common Belief] isn't what leads to [Success]... It's [Core Insight]"
- **Platform:** LinkedIn
- **Execution Preview:** "We've noticed a pattern: The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials. They start with community."

**2. Contrarian Truth Template** (Justin Welsh)
- **Fit Assessment:** ✅ STRONG
- **Why it fits:** Challenges assumption that credentials are required
- **Structure:** "Most people think [X] is [importance]. I think [actual importance]."
- **Platform:** LinkedIn, X/Twitter
- **Execution Preview:** "Most people think you need a teaching credential to start a school. I think you need 8-12 committed families. That's it."

**3. This vs That Template** (LinkedIn Swipe File #55)
- **Fit Assessment:** ✅ STRONG
- **Why it fits:** Clear contrast between traditional approach and microschool reality
- **Structure:** "[A] says: [belief]. [B] says: [contrarian belief]." (Multiple rounds)
- **Platform:** LinkedIn, Instagram carousel
- **Execution Preview:** "Traditional schools say: 'You need certified teachers.' Microschools say: 'About half our guides are parents without credentials.'"

**4. What If It Was Simpler Template** (Justin Welsh)
- **Fit Assessment:** ✅ STRONG
- **Why it fits:** Simplifies perceived complexity of starting a school
- **Structure:** "What if [goal] was simpler? → [simple steps]"
- **Platform:** LinkedIn, Facebook
- **Execution Preview:** "What if starting a school was simpler than you thought? → 8-12 families, 2-3 days/week, space to meet. That's it."

**5. Behavior Dichotomy** (Post Structures)
- **Fit Assessment:** ⚠️ MODERATE
- **Why it fits:** Could work but less narrative power
- **Structure:** "[X] people do 'x'. [Y] people do '-x'"
- **Platform:** X/Twitter, Facebook
- **Execution Preview:** "Failed founders chase credentials. Successful ones build community."

**6. Shoutout Post** (LinkedIn Swipe File #20)
- **Fit Assessment:** ✅ STRONG (for brand account, not individual)
- **Why it fits:** Can highlight multiple founders who embody this truth
- **Structure:** "We're seeing something remarkable: Leaders like [Name 1], [Name 2], [Name 3]..."
- **Platform:** LinkedIn (brand account only)
- **Execution Preview:** "Leaders like Kelly Smith (Prenda), Jon England (Education Innovators), Dalena Wallace (WISE)..."

... [Continue through 10 options]

### SELECTED FOR EXECUTION (Top 3):
1. **Pattern Recognition** (LinkedIn) - Highest narrative power, proven performer
2. **This vs That** (LinkedIn/IG) - Visual, shareable, clear contrast
3. **What If It Was Simpler** (LinkedIn/FB) - Removes barriers, empowers action

**Rationale:** Pattern Recognition tells the story. This vs That is highly shareable. What If It Was Simpler drives action. Together they cover awareness → inspiration → enablement.
```

**Quality Check for Framework Matching:**
- [ ] Generated at least 5-10 framework options per concept
- [ ] Assessed fit strength (STRONG/MODERATE/WEAK)
- [ ] Explained WHY concept fits or doesn't fit each framework
- [ ] Selected best 2-4 with clear rationale
- [ ] Considered platform appropriateness
- [ ] Avoided first-match bias (didn't stop at obvious choice)

**Reference for this phase:**
- `references/linkedin-frameworks.md`
- `references/post-structures.md`

---

### Phase 3: Execute Selected Frameworks

**Goal:** Create polished, platform-optimized posts from selected frameworks

#### Step 1: Determine Output Scope

**Quick Social Plan** (1-3 posts):
- Select 1-3 best framework matches
- Execute one variation per framework
- Total output: 1-3 posts

**Multi-Platform Campaign** (5-10 posts):
- Select 5-10 framework matches across concepts
- Generate 1-2 variations per framework
- Total output: 5-10 posts

**High-Volume Repurposing** (10-20 posts):
- Select 10-15 framework matches
- Generate 2-3 variations per framework
- Total output: 10-20+ posts

#### Step 2: Execute Each Framework

Create file: `[Source]_Social_Posts.md`

**For each selected framework:**

1. **Load Framework Structure**
   - Reference the specific template from libraries
   - Note the exact structure/formula

2. **Fill with Concept Details**
   - Insert core insight
   - Add context as needed
   - Include specific examples, names, data

3. **Apply Voice**
   - **Brand voice:** OpenEd account (institutional but warm)
   - **Individual voice:** Grant, Ela, etc. (personal, authentic)
   - Reference: `Frameworks/Style/Pirate Wires Imitation Style Guide.md`

4. **Platform-Specific Optimization**
   - Apply platform rules (see Platform Guidelines below)
   - Hashtag strategy
   - Link placement
   - Character limits

5. **Generate Variations**
   - Create 1-3 variations of same framework
   - Vary hook, examples, or closing
   - Different lengths for different platforms

#### Platform-Specific Guidelines

**LinkedIn:**
- **Length:** Long-form value-dense posts outperform (200-500 words)
- **Links:** Always in comments (not main post)
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 maximum, minimal
- **Voice:** Professional yet conversational, thought leadership
- **Hook:** First 2 lines critical (shows in feed before "see more")
- **Structure:** Hook → Body → Insight → Question or CTA
- **Tagging:** Tag mentioned people/orgs (increases reach)

**X (Twitter):**
- **Length:** 70-100 characters optimal (despite 280 limit)
- **Hashtags:** 1-2 maximum
- **Voice:** Witty, concise, to-the-point
- **Threads:** Use for longer concepts (link to thread in main tweet)
- **Current focus:** Reply game until 500-1000 followers (low posting ROI)

**Facebook:**
- **Length:** 40-140 characters optimal
- **Links:** NO external links in main post (kills reach)
- **Hashtags:** NO hashtags (Facebook doesn't reward them)
- **Voice:** Informal, playful, personable
- **Format:** Question posts with background images perform best
- **Audience:** Parents in program (80% category, 20% program)

**Instagram:**
- **Length:** 30-125 characters for feed captions
- **Hashtags:** 5-10 relevant hashtags
- **Voice:** Friendly, authentic, micro-story format
- **Formats:** Reels outperform static posts, carousels for educational content
- **Audience:** Further up funnel (problem aware, not solution aware)

#### Step 3: Format Post Output

**LinkedIn Post Example:**

```markdown
## POST 1: Pattern Recognition Template

We've noticed a pattern:

The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials.

They start with community.

Dalena Wallace was homeschooling six kids in Kansas when she realized: "This is hard. I need community."

She opened a Prenda microschool in her home with three families. Within months, she had 16.

Kelly Smith started with 7 kids around his kitchen table. Today Prenda serves nearly 10,000 students.

Jon England spent 14 years in traditional schools before realizing: teachers need support to create their dream schools. Now he's helped launch over 100.

The National Microschooling Center started from one question: "Can you help me start a microschool?"

The answer was yes.

Then it was yes again.

And again.

Now they support schools across multiple states.

Here's the lesson:

You don't need permission.

You don't need a building.

You don't need millions in funding.

You need 8-12 families who want something different.

The rest? There are people ready to help you figure it out.

Tag someone who's been thinking about starting a microschool but doesn't think they're "qualified."

**Framework:** Pattern Recognition (LinkedIn Swipe File #48)
**Voice:** OpenEd brand
**Word Count:** 247
**Hashtags:** #Education #Microschools #CommunityFirst
**Platform:** LinkedIn
**Link in Comments:** [Article URL]
**Tags:** @Kelly Smith @Jon England @National Microschooling Center
```

**X/Twitter Thread Example:**

```markdown
## POST 2: This vs That (Thread)

**Tweet 1:**
Traditional schools say: "You need certified teachers with degrees."

Microschools say: "About half our guides are parents without credentials."

**Tweet 2:**
Traditional schools say: "5 days a week, 180 days a year, everyone learns the same."

Microschools say: "2-3 days/week, mixed ages, learn at your own pace."

**Tweet 3:**
Traditional schools say: "It costs $15,000+ per student."

Microschools say: "$2,000-15,000 with sliding scale."

**Tweet 4:**
Here's the result at Prenda:

→ 18% increase in grade-level proficiency
→ Intrinsic motivation: 27% → 62%
→ Kids who WANT to be there: 36% → 86%

The question isn't which is "better."

It's which is better for YOUR family.

**Framework:** This vs That (LinkedIn Swipe File #55) adapted to thread
**Voice:** OpenEd brand
**Thread Length:** 4 tweets
**Hashtags:** #Education #Microschools (only on first tweet)
**Platform:** X/Twitter
```

**Facebook Post Example:**

```markdown
## POST 3: Question Post

What if starting a school was simpler than you thought?

→ 8-12 committed families
→ 2-3 days per week
→ Space to meet (church, rec center, living room)
→ No building required

That's it. A minimum viable microschool.

Dalena Wallace did it in her Kansas living room. Kelly Smith started with 7 kids around his kitchen table.

The permission you're really seeking isn't from the state.

It's from yourself.

- [ ] Format optimized for platform

**Framework Fidelity:**
- [ ] Actually follows selected framework structure
- [ ] Doesn't drift into generic post
- [ ] Template name documented for reference

**Strategic Alignment:**
- [ ] Would target audience stop scrolling for this?
- [ ] Creates curiosity, emotion, or value in first 2 seconds?
- [ ] Clear what action reader should take (if any)?

### Phase 4: Proliferate Winners (OPTIONAL)

**Goal:** Multiply high-performing posts using SCAMPER, Human Desires, and Vision/Anti-Vision reframing

**When to use this phase:**
- Monthly: Study top-performing posts and multiply them
- Pre-posting: Generate many options, select best before publishing
- Content drought: Multiply existing winners instead of creating new

#### Method 1: SCAMPER Variations

Generate 7 variations from one post (one per letter):

**S - Substitute**
- Replace the main idea with adjacent concept
- Swap the method/process for accomplishing benefit
- Change the examples while keeping structure

**C - Combine**
- Merge with personal experience or story
- Combine two similar concepts for more power
- Add a reply to someone else's post as your own content

**A - Adapt**
- Expand Heavy-Hitting One-Liner into full post or thread
- Add "missing piece" that wasn't in original
- Adapt to different platform with same core idea

**M - Modify**
- Magnify specific pain points (exaggeration for effect)
- Use same idea in different post format
- Make more "punchy" by removing words

**P - Purpose** (Put to other use)
- Angle for different audience segment
- What other benefit/pain point can this solve?
- Example: "Web design for freelancing" → "Web design for your business"

**E - Eliminate**
- Remove words to make punchier
- Simplify complex explanation
- Cut nuance and uncertainty

**R - Reverse**
- Flip the idea completely
- "With X you get Y" becomes "Without X you stay stuck with Z"
- Positive framing becomes negative (or vice versa)

**SCAMPER Example:**

Original post:
> "The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials. They start with community."

**S - Substitute:**
> "The most successful microschool founders don't start with curriculum. They start with committed families."

**C - Combine:**
> "I spent years thinking I needed a teaching credential to start a school. Then I met Dalena Wallace. She started with 3 families in her living room. Within months, 16 students. The most successful founders don't start with credentials. They start with community."

**A - Adapt (expand to thread):**
> "Thread: 3 things successful microschool founders start with (hint: not credentials)
>
> 1. Community (8-12 committed families)
> 2. A guide who cares (not necessarily a teacher)
> 3. A space to meet (living room, church, rec center)
>
> That's it. The rest you figure out together."

**M - Modify (magnify pain):**
> "You're waiting for the 'perfect' teaching credential while your kid suffers in a system that wasn't designed for them. The most successful microschool founders don't wait. They start with community."

**P - Purpose (angle for different audience):**
> "Burned out teachers: The most successful microschool founders aren't career educators. They're parents who wanted something better. You already have the skills. You just need 8-12 committed families."

**E - Eliminate (simplify):**
> "Successful microschool founders start with community, not credentials."

**R - Reverse:**
> "Without community, your teaching credentials mean nothing. Ask any burned-out public school teacher."

**Reference for SCAMPER:** `references/scamper-guide.md`

#### Method 2: Human Desires Reframing

Spin concept through 8 desire lenses to create 8 variations:

1. **Safety of Tribe**
2. **Survival & Success**
3. **Life Enjoyment**
4. **Social Acceptance**
5. **Sexual Companionship** (usually not applicable for education content)
6. **Comfort & Clarity**
7. **Freedom From Fear**
8. **Perceived Status**

**Human Desires Example:**

Original concept: "Credentials vs Community"

**Safety of Tribe:**
> "Your kid needs a tribe that gets them. Not a credential on the wall. The most successful microschool founders build community first, credentials never."

**Survival & Success:**
> "The path to success isn't through credentials. It's through community. Every successful microschool founder knows this. The credential-obsessed schools are failing. The community-first microschools are thriving."

**Life Enjoyment:**
> "Life's too short to let credentials stop you from building the school your kid deserves. Successful microschool founders prioritize joy and community over paperwork and requirements."

**Social Acceptance:**
> "Worried what people will think if you start a school without a teaching credential? The most successful microschool founders worried about that too. Then they did it anyway. Now they're the ones other parents want to be like."

**Comfort & Clarity:**
> "Starting a school feels overwhelming. Too many requirements, too many credentials needed. Here's what brings clarity: successful microschool founders don't start there. They start with 8-12 families who want something different. Everything else becomes clear after that."

**Freedom From Fear:**
> "The fear of 'not being qualified' stops more microschools than anything else. But here's the truth: the most successful founders aren't the most credentialed. They're the ones who pushed through that fear and started with community."

**Perceived Status:**
> "Society tells you credentials = status. But successful microschool founders know better. Real status comes from kids who love learning, parents who trust you, and a community you built from scratch."

**Reference for Human Desires:** `references/human-desires-guide.md`

#### Method 3: Vision/Anti-Vision Reframing

Frame concept through OpenEd vision and anti-vision:

**OpenEd Vision:**
- Personalized education tailored to each child
- Family autonomy and wholeness
- Kids who love learning
- Parents empowered, not inadequate
- Mix-and-match educational freedom

**OpenEd Anti-Vision:**
- One-size-fits-all standardization
- Institutional conformity and credential gatekeeping
- Kids who hate school
- Parents feeling helpless
- Educational monopoly

**Vision/Anti-Vision Example:**

Original: "Credentials vs Community"

**Vision Framing (what we're FOR):**
> "This is what educational freedom looks like: 8-12 families, a guide who cares, a space to meet. No credentials required. Just community. That's how the most successful microschools start. That's open education."

**Anti-Vision Framing (what we're AGAINST):**
> "The credential gatekeepers want you to believe you're not qualified. They want you dependent on their system. The most successful microschool founders ignored them and started with community instead. That's how you break the educational monopoly."

**Both (Transformation):**
> "From credential gatekeeping to community empowerment. From 'you're not qualified' to 'you and 8-12 families can do this.' The most successful microschool founders made this shift. You can too."

**Reference for Vision/Anti-Vision:** `references/vision-framing-guide.md`

#### Proliferation Output

Create file: `[Post Title]_Proliferations.md`

Include:
- 7 SCAMPER variations
- 8 Human Desire reframes (or applicable ones)
- 2-3 Vision/Anti-Vision frames
- **Total: 17-18 new variations from 1 original post**

**Proliferation Strategy:**
- Generate all variations
- Select best 3-5 for scheduling
- Space out over weeks/months
- Test different angles with same core concept
- Track which variations perform best

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Content Issues
❌ **First-Match Bias** - Picking the first framework that fits without exploring options
❌ **Generic Posts** - Not using any framework, just writing
❌ **Too Many Concepts** - Trying to cover multiple ideas in one post
❌ **Missing Context** - Concept doesn't stand alone without source material

### Framework Issues
❌ **Framework Drift** - Starting with a framework then abandoning its structure
❌ **Mismatched Fit** - Forcing a concept into framework that doesn't amplify it
❌ **No Volume Generation** - Creating only 1 option instead of 5-10+

### Platform Issues
❌ **Wrong Link Placement** - External links in Facebook posts, LinkedIn main posts
❌ **Hashtag Overload** - Too many hashtags for platform (LinkedIn, X)
❌ **Platform Voice Mismatch** - Too formal for Facebook, too casual for LinkedIn

### Process Issues
❌ **Skipping Concept Extraction** - Trying to write posts without identifying standalone concepts first
❌ **No Framework Matching** - Writing "from scratch" instead of using proven templates
❌ **Not Documenting Framework** - Can't reference what worked later

---

## Success Metrics

A successful social post:

✅ **Follows a proven framework** - Not generic, has clear structure
✅ **Stops the scroll** - Hook creates curiosity/emotion in first 2 seconds
✅ **Standalone value** - Concept works without reading source material
✅ **Platform-optimized** - Follows rules for hashtags, links, length, voice
✅ **Framework documented** - Template name noted for future reference
✅ **Shareable** - Audience would forward/tag others
✅ **Authentic voice** - Sounds like real person, not corporate
