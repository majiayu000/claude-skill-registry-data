description: Atom hackable text editor from GitHub. Use for extensible editing.

# Atom (Legacy)

> [!WARNING]
> **Atom is Discontinued**. GitHub archived the project in 2022.

Atom pioneered Electron-based editors and the modern extension model. Its spirit lives on in **VS Code** (Microsoft) and **Zed** (created by Atom's founder).

## When to Use

- **Do Not Use**: It receives no security updates.
- **Migration**: If you have Atom packages, look for their VS Code equivalents.

## Alternatives (2025)

1.  **VS Code**: The direct successor in spirit and tech stack.
2.  **Zed**: The spiritual successor by the same creator (Nathan Sobo).
3.  **Pulsar**: A community fork attempting to keep Atom alive.

## Core Concepts (Historical)

### Teletype

Real-time collaboration (precursor to Live Share).

### APM (Atom Package Manager)

The tool that inspired `code --install-extension`.
