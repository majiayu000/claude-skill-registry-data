# Test-Driven Development

Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle: write a failing test first, implement the minimum code to pass, then refactor while keeping tests green. TDD encourages testable designs, ensures high coverage, and keeps you focused on requirements. Start with the simplest test case and incrementally add complexity. Not every situation requires TDD, but it's valuable for complex logic.
