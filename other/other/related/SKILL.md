# /related

Find all notes related to a topic using parallel sub-agents for comprehensive search.

## Usage

```
/related <topic>
/related VendorA
/related SAP BTP
/related Jane Doe
```

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Planning

1. Analyse the topic to determine:
   - Is it a person? → Focus on Person notes, meetings with them
   - Is it a technology? → Focus on Pages, ADRs, Projects
   - Is it a project? → Focus on Project, Meetings, Tasks
   - Is it an organisation? → Focus on Organisation, People, Meetings

2. Load relevant context file:
   - People topic → `.claude/context/people.md`
   - Tech topic → `.claude/context/technology.md`
   - Project topic → `.claude/context/projects.md`
   - Org topic → `.claude/context/organisations.md`

### Phase 2: Parallel Search (use sub-agents)

Launch 4 sub-agents in parallel using `model: "haiku"` for efficiency:

**Agent 1: Direct Matches** (Haiku)
- Find notes with topic in filename
- Find notes with topic in title frontmatter
- Return: filename, type, title

**Agent 2: Content Search** (Haiku)
- Grep for topic across all .md files in vault root
- Return: filename, matching line, context

**Agent 3: Backlink Analysis** (Haiku)
- If a note exists for topic, find all notes linking TO it
- Return: linking notes with context

**Agent 4: Tag & Metadata Search** (Haiku)
- Search frontmatter for topic in tags, project, organisation fields
- Return: notes with metadata matches

### Phase 3: Compile & Rank Results
