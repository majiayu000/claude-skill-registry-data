# Naming Conventions

Use camelCase for JavaScript/TypeScript variables and functions. Use PascalCase for classes and React components. Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants. Use kebab-case for file names in many projects. Boolean variables should be prefixed with is, has, can, should. Event handlers often use handle prefix. Follow the conventions established in the codebase.
