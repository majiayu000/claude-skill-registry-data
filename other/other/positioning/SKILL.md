# Positioning Expert (April Dunford Method)

> Master product positioning using April Dunford's proven 5+1 framework from "Obviously Awesome". Transform how customers perceive your product by deliberately setting the right context.

## When to Use This Skill

- Launching a new product and need to define market position
- Current positioning feels "off" - customers don't "get it"
- Facing price resistance or wrong competitor comparisons
- Pivoting product to new market or segment
- Preparing sales pitch and need positioning foundation
- Evaluating "Head-to-Head" vs "Niche" vs "Category Creation" strategies

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: April Dunford - "Obviously Awesome" (2019) & "Sales Pitch" (2023)

**Core Principle**: Positioning is context setting. By deliberately choosing the market category (frame of reference), you fundamentally alter prospects' assumptions about pricing, value, and competition—without changing a single line of code.

**The Cake vs Muffin Paradigm**: The same baked good positioned as "cake" competes with ice cream and pie (dessert), but positioned as "muffin" competes with bagels and yogurt (breakfast). The product hasn't changed—the context has. A "dry cake" becomes a "hearty muffin."

## What This Skill Does

1. **Diagnoses positioning problems** - Identifies if issues are positioning vs product
2. **Applies 5+1 Component Framework** - Systematic positioning development
3. **Guides 10-Step Workshop Process** - Cross-functional positioning exercise
4. **Recommends positioning style** - Head-to-Head, Niche, or Category Creation
5. **Translates to Sales Narrative** - 8-step pitch structure
6. **Creates Positioning Canvas** - Single-page strategic document

## How to Use

### Diagnose Positioning Issues
```
Analyze if my product has a positioning problem. Here's the situation: [describe symptoms like price objections, customer confusion, wrong comparisons]
```

### Develop New Positioning
```
Help me position my product using April Dunford's framework.
Product: [description]
Current customers: [who buys it]
Problem: [what problem they have with current positioning]
```

### Choose Positioning Style
```
Should I go Head-to-Head, Big Fish Small Pond, or Create a New Category for [product]? Help me evaluate each approach.
```

### Build Sales Pitch from Positioning
```
Convert this positioning into an 8-step sales narrative: [positioning canvas or description]
```

## Instructions

When helping with positioning, follow April Dunford's methodology precisely:

### Step 1: Diagnose - Is This a Positioning Problem?

Before developing positioning, confirm the issue is actually positioning-related:

```
## Positioning Problem Diagnosis

**Symptoms of Weak Positioning:**

| Symptom | What It Looks Like | Score (1-5) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| "What is it?" confusion | Prospects ask "So, are you like X?" 15 min into demo | |
| Price resistance | "I love it but it's too expensive" (wrong comparison) | |
| Feature gap requests | Prospects ask for irrelevant features | |
| High churn | Customers leave saying "thought it would do X" | |
| Long sales cycles | Takes forever to explain value | |

**Diagnosis**: If 3+ symptoms score 3+, this is likely a positioning problem.

**Key Insight**: A product can fail in one market category and succeed in another without any R&D—purely by changing the frame of reference.
```

### Step 2: Apply the 5+1 Components Framework

Work through each component in order—they have logical dependencies:

```
## The 5+1 Positioning Components

### Component 1: Competitive Alternatives
**Question**: What would customers do if your solution didn't exist?

**Common alternatives:**
- Direct competitors (rare - usually not the real threat)
- Status quo ("doing nothing", "living with the pain")
- Manual processes (Excel, email, pen & paper)
- In-house solutions ("script the CTO wrote 5 years ago")

**Warning**: Avoid the "Phantom Competitor" fallacy. Don't position against Salesforce if customers are using spreadsheets.

**Your alternatives**:
1. ________________________________
2. ________________________________
3. ________________________________

---

### Component 2: Unique Attributes
**Question**: What features/capabilities do YOU have that alternatives LACK?

**Rules:**
- Must compare to alternatives from Component 1
- Must be factual and provable
- "Easy to use" doesn't count unless you have data

**Your unique attributes**:
| Attribute | Why Competitors Don't Have It |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |

---

### Component 3: Value (and Proof)
**Question**: What benefit do those attributes enable?

**Translation Layer:**
- Engineers speak: "10ms latency", "ISO 27001"
- Buyers hear: "Don't lose customers at checkout", "Don't get sued"

**Value Cluster Template:**

| Unique Attribute | → | Value to Customer | Proof |
|-----------------|---|-------------------|-------|
| [technical feature] | → | [business outcome] | [data/case study] |
| | → | | |

---

### Component 4: Target Market Characteristics
**Question**: Who cares DISPROPORTIONATELY about this value?

**Bad segmentation**: "We target mid-sized banks"
**Good segmentation**: "We target mid-sized banks currently undergoing regulatory audit on data privacy"

**Situational Triggers**:
- What situation makes this value urgent?
- What event triggers the buying decision?

**Your target**: Companies/people who ________________________________
**Because**: They're experiencing ________________________________

---

### Component 5: Market Category
**Question**: What frame of reference makes your unique attributes look like strengths?

**The category dictates:**
- Competitive set
- Budget category
- Buyer expectations

**Category options to consider**:
| Category Option | Competitive Set | Your Position |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| [Category A] | [Competitors] | [Strong/Weak/Irrelevant] |
| [Category B] | [Competitors] | [Strong/Weak/Irrelevant] |
| [Category C] | [Competitors] | [Strong/Weak/Irrelevant] |

**Best category**: Where your unique attributes = must-have features

---

### Component +1: Relevant Trends (Optional)
**Question**: What trend makes this solution urgent RIGHT NOW?

**Rules:**
- Trend must connect to your value pillars
- Don't attach to irrelevant trends (cynicism)
- Creates urgency, not the position itself

**Trend**: ________________________________
**Connection to value**: ________________________________
```

### Step 3: Choose Positioning Style

```
## Three Positioning Styles

### Style 1: Head-to-Head
**The play**: Enter existing market, claim to be the best
**When to use**: Market fragmented (no leader) OR leader complacent with obsolete tech
**Risk**: HIGH - Fighting the "Gorilla" with more budget and brand
**Requirement**: Distinct, quantifiable advantage for majority of market

### Style 2: Big Fish, Small Pond (RECOMMENDED FOR MOST B2B)
**The play**: Carve out specific sub-segment of existing market
**Example**: "CRM for Investment Banks" instead of "CRM"
**When to use**: Default for most B2B startups
**Risk**: LOW - Caps TAM but gains dominance, pricing power, low CAC
**Requirement**: Features highly specific to niche that generalist would never build

### Style 3: Create a New Game (Category Creation)
**The play**: Create category that didn't exist
**When to use**: Truly disruptive innovation that defies comparison
**Risk**: VERY HIGH - Must educate market or die
**Requirement**: Massive marketing resources, long education cycle
**Reward**: If successful, become "Category King" (HubSpot, Drift)

---

**Decision Framework:**

| Factor | Head-to-Head | Big Fish Small Pond | New Category |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Market maturity | Mature | Mature | Emerging |
| Your resources | High | Low-Medium | Very High |
| Differentiation | Better at core | Better for niche | Different paradigm |
| Sales cycle | Medium | Short | Long |
| Risk | High | Low | Very High |
```

### Step 4: Create Positioning Canvas

```
## Positioning Canvas

**Product**: ________________________________

| Component | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Competitive Alternatives** | [What customers would use otherwise] |
| **Unique Attributes** | [What you have that alternatives lack] |
| **Value** | [Benefits those attributes enable] |
| **Target Customers** | [Who cares most about that value] |
| **Market Category** | [Frame of reference for value] |
| **Trend** (optional) | [Why this matters now] |

---

**Positioning Statement** (internal use):
For [target customers] who [situation/trigger], [product] is a [category] that [key value].
Unlike [alternatives], we [unique differentiation].

---

**One-liner** (external use):
[Product] helps [target] achieve [value] through [unique approach].
```

### Step 5: Translate to Sales Narrative (8-Step Pitch)

```
## Sales Pitch Structure (from Positioning)

### THE SETUP (Market Context)

**1. The Insight**
Start with tension about customer's world:
> "We've noticed that [trend/problem] is affecting [target market]..."

**2. The Alternatives**
Validate current pain:
> "Most teams try to manage this with [alternative 1] or [alternative 2]..."

**3. The Perfect World**
Define buying criteria BEFORE introducing product:
> "In a perfect world, you would be able to [ideal state]..."

### THE FOLLOW-THROUGH (Solution)

**4. The Introduction**
Now introduce product:
> "That's why we built [Product], a [category]..."

**5. Differentiated Value**
Show how you deliver the perfect world:
> "We do this through [unique attribute], which means [value]..."

**6. Proof**
Social proof, case studies, data:
> "For example, [customer] achieved [specific result]..."

**7. Objections**
Pre-handle resistance:
> "You might be wondering about [common objection]. Here's how we handle that..."

**8. The Ask**
Close for next step:
> "The next step would be [specific action]..."
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Database → Data Warehouse Pivot

**Situation**: Startup built a database. Positioned as "Database," prospects asked about SQL, ACID compliance, transaction volume. Product was weak on transactions but incredible at analytics.

**Problem**: In "Database" context, they were a "bad database" losing to Oracle.

**Positioning Pivot**:
- **Unique attribute**: Incredible speed on massive aggregate queries
- **Context shift**: Repositioned as "Data Warehouse"
- **Result**: In "Data Warehouse" context, no one expects transaction support. Weakness became irrelevant. Speed became hero feature.

**Outcome**: Sales cycle collapsed from months to weeks. Pricing power increased.

---

### Example 2: Userlist - Email Tool → SaaS Messaging

**Situation**: Userlist entered as email tool facing Intercom (expensive) and Mailchimp (not SaaS-specific).

**Problem**: "We are like Intercom but cheaper" = feature war they couldn't win.

**Positioning Analysis**:
- **Alternatives**: Best customers used in-house scripts, not competitors
- **Unique attribute**: Data model understanding "User" vs "Company" (B2B SaaS necessity)
- **Value**: "Email automation specifically for B2B SaaS"

**Result**: Big Fish Small Pond strategy. Became "Customer Messaging for SaaS."
- Premium pricing for SaaS-specific features
- Ignored e-commerce customers (wrong fit)
- Focused roadmap and marketing

---

### Example 3: The Cake vs Muffin

**Product**: Dense, not very sweet, portable baked good with chocolate.

**Positioned as "Cake"**:
- Competitors: Ice cream, pie, tiramisu
- Expectation: Sweet, frosted, celebratory
- Review: "Dry and boring" → FAIL

**Positioned as "Muffin"**:
- Competitors: Bagel, yogurt, banana
- Expectation: Substantial, portable, not too sweet
- Review: "Hearty and healthy" → SUCCESS

**Same product. Different context. Opposite outcomes.**

## Checklists & Templates

### Positioning Workshop Checklist (10 Steps)

```
## Pre-Workshop

- [ ] Identify "Best-Fit" customers (those who "get it" instantly)
- [ ] Assemble cross-functional team (Sales, CS, Product, Marketing, CEO)
- [ ] CEO committed to attend (required for authority)
- [ ] Team aligned on vocabulary and willing to release baggage

## Workshop

- [ ] Step 1: List TRUE competitive alternatives (from customer POV)
- [ ] Step 2: Isolate unique attributes (factual, provable)
- [ ] Step 3: Map attributes to value clusters (So What?)
- [ ] Step 4: Determine who cares most (situational triggers)
- [ ] Step 5: Test market category options
- [ ] Step 6: Layer on relevant trend (if applicable)
- [ ] Step 7: Document in Positioning Canvas

## Post-Workshop

- [ ] Translate to sales narrative
- [ ] Update all marketing materials
- [ ] Train sales team on new pitch
- [ ] Schedule 6-month review
```

### Positioning Red Flags Checklist

```
- [ ] "We are the Uber of X" → Brings competitor baggage
- [ ] "All-in-one platform" → Diluted, unclear message
- [ ] Marketing wrote it without Sales → Will be ignored
- [ ] Based on what we WANTED to build, not what we BUILT
- [ ] Positioning against competitor customers don't use
- [ ] No proof for value claims
- [ ] Target market = "Everyone"
```

### Governance: When to Revisit Positioning

```
## Scheduled Reviews
- [ ] Every 6 months: Sanity check

## Event-Driven Triggers
- [ ] Major competitor enters market
- [ ] Significant product feature released
- [ ] External environment shift (new regulation, trend)
- [ ] Acquisition or merger
- [ ] Entering new geographic market
```

## Skill Boundaries (Frontier Recognition)

### This skill excels for:
- B2B products with unclear competitive positioning
- Pivots where existing positioning no longer fits
- New products needing go-to-market framing
- Sales teams losing deals due to "wrong comparison" objections

### This skill is NOT ideal for:
- **Brand-new categories** with no analogous market → Consider category-design skill instead
- **Commodity products** where positioning = price/features only → Focus on differentiation first
- **Consumer products** where emotional positioning dominates → Supplement with brand-strategy skill
- **Technical implementation** of positioning (website, sales deck) → Use sales-pitch-dunford after

### Quality Checkpoints

Before accepting the output, verify:
- [ ] Competitive alternatives are what customers ACTUALLY use (not just direct competitors)
- [ ] Unique attributes are provable and specific (not "easy to use")
- [ ] Target segment has a clear situational trigger (not just demographics)
- [ ] Market category makes your weaknesses irrelevant
- [ ] Positioning statement could NOT be used by a competitor

---

## Iteration Guide

> "The first output is a starting point, not a destination."

### Recommended Iteration Pattern

| Pass | Focus | Questions to Ask |
|------|-------|------------------|
| **1st** | Alternatives | "Are these the REAL alternatives my customers consider?" |
| **2nd** | Attributes | "Can I prove these? Would customers agree?" |
| **3rd** | Value | "Is this the language customers use to describe the benefit?" |
| **4th** | Target | "Is the segment specific enough to build a sales playbook for?" |

### Useful Follow-up Prompts

After the first output, try:
- "My customers actually compare us to [X], not [Y]. Redo with that context."
- "The value statement feels generic. Here's what customers say in their own words: [quotes]"
- "Stress-test this positioning against [specific competitor]. Where does it break?"
- "My sales team would object that [objection]. How do we address this in the positioning?"

---

## Learning Curve

| Usage | What You'll Experience |
|-------|----------------------|
| **1st use** | Full framework walkthrough, discover the 5+1 structure |
| **3rd use** | You anticipate the questions, prep better inputs |
| **10th use** | Framework becomes second nature, you focus on nuance |

**Pro tip**: The quality of your positioning output directly correlates with how well you know your best-fit customers. If outputs feel generic, go interview 5 customers first.
