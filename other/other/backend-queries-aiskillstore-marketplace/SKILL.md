name: backend-queries
description: Write secure, optimized database queries using parameterized statements, eager loading, proper indexing, and transaction management. Use this skill when writing database queries, implementing data fetching logic, optimizing query performance, preventing SQL injection, handling N+1 query problems, using ORMs or query builders, implementing caching strategies, or managing database transactions. Apply when working with SQL queries, ORM query methods, database repository patterns, or any code that retrieves or manipulates data from databases.

# Backend Queries

## When to use this skill

- When writing database queries using ORM methods or raw SQL
- When implementing data fetching logic in controllers, services, or repositories
- When optimizing query performance or addressing slow database operations
- When using eager loading to prevent N+1 query problems
- When implementing filtering, sorting, or pagination for data sets
- When writing JOIN operations or querying related data
- When using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- When implementing database transactions for related operations
- When adding query timeouts or performance monitoring
- When caching expensive or frequently-run queries
- When selecting specific columns instead of using SELECT *
- When creating database indexes to optimize query performance
- When refactoring queries for better efficiency or readability

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend queries.
