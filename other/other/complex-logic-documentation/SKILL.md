# Complex Logic Documentation

When implementing complex algorithms, mathematical formulas, or intricate business rules, add comments explaining the approach. Reference external sources (papers, specifications, tickets) when applicable. Break complex algorithms into labeled steps. For business rules, document the requirements they implement. This helps future maintainers understand and safely modify the code.
