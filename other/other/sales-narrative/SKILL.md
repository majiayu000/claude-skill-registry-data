# Sales Pitch Dunford

> Master April Dunford's 8-step sales narrative from "Sales Pitch" (2023). Transform your positioning into a compelling story that wins enterprise deals.

## When to Use This Skill

- Structuring B2B sales presentations and demos
- Creating pitch decks for complex products
- Training sales teams on narrative-driven selling
- Converting positioning strategy into sales conversations
- Winning against entrenched competitors
- Selling to enterprise buyers with long decision cycles

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: April Dunford - "Sales Pitch" (2023) + "Obviously Awesome" (2019)

**Core Principle**: The sales pitch is the narrative implementation of positioning. A robust positioning strategy is useless if it dies in a PowerPoint deck. The pitch must follow a specific arc that establishes context before presenting the product.

**Why This Matters**: Without a positioning-led narrative, sales reps revert to the "Feature Dump"—opening the laptop and listing features. This forces the customer to figure out why those features matter, leading to comparison against the wrong things, focus on price, and stalled deals.


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Structures the 8-step narrative arc** - From insight to close
2. **Connects positioning to conversation** - Strategy becomes pitch
3. **Builds "The Setup" phase** - Establishes context before product
4. **Creates "The Follow-Through"** - Presents solution with proof
5. **Aligns Marketing and Sales** - Same story, different formats

## How to Use

### Build a Complete Sales Pitch
```
Create a Dunford-style sales pitch for:
Product: [description]
Category: [market category]
Unique value: [differentiation]
Target buyer: [persona]
Key competitors: [alternatives they'd consider]
```

### Transform Positioning into Pitch
```
I have this positioning:
[paste positioning canvas or statement]

Create an 8-step sales narrative from this positioning.
```

### Review a Sales Deck
```
Review this pitch against Dunford's 8-step framework:
[paste deck outline or key slides]

Identify what's missing or out of order.
```

## Instructions

When creating sales pitches, follow Dunford's 8-step narrative structure precisely:

### Phase 1: THE SETUP (Establishing Context)

**Purpose:** Create tension and establish buying criteria BEFORE introducing your product.

#### Step 1: The Insight

```
## Step 1: The Insight

**Purpose:** Start with a statement about the customer's world that creates tension.

**Format:**
"We've noticed that [trend or market shift]..."
"There's been a fundamental change in [customer's domain]..."
"[Industry] is facing a new reality: [insight]..."

**What Makes a Good Insight:**
- Based on market research or data
- Hints at a problem or opportunity
- Creates tension or curiosity
- Customer nods in recognition

**Examples:**

B2B SaaS:
"We've noticed that data volumes in healthcare are doubling every 18 months,
but IT budgets are staying flat."

Cybersecurity:
"The average enterprise now has 76 different security tools—yet breach
rates have never been higher."

HR Tech:
"Remote work has fundamentally changed how employees experience culture.
The old playbook doesn't work anymore."

**Warning:** Don't introduce your product here. Build tension first.
```

#### Step 2: The Alternatives

```
## Step 2: The Alternatives

**Purpose:** Discuss current ways of coping. Validate the customer's pain
and set up the "villain."

**Format:**
"Most teams try to handle this by [alternative 1], [alternative 2], or [alternative 3]..."
"The typical approaches are..."
"What we see companies doing today is..."

**Key Principle:**
The alternatives come directly from your Positioning Canvas (Component 1:
Competitive Alternatives). This is NOT about listing competitors—it's about
what customers do if your solution doesn't exist.

**Common Alternatives:**
- The Status Quo ("living with the pain")
- Manual Processes ("Excel," "the intern," "email")
- In-house Solutions ("some script the CTO wrote")
- Competitor Products (only if actually considered)

**Examples:**

Data Platform:
"Most teams try to manage this with spreadsheets and manual data entry.
Some hire consultants. Others build internal tools that become maintenance nightmares."

Security:
"Teams typically respond by adding more point solutions—another tool for
endpoints, another for cloud, another for email. Or they hire more analysts
and hope they can keep up."

**Then Show Why Alternatives Fail:**
"But here's the problem with these approaches..."
- Spreadsheets: "Errors creep in, versions conflict, no real-time view"
- More tools: "Creates more complexity, more alerts, more fatigue"
- Hiring: "Talent is scarce and expensive; doesn't scale"

**Purpose:** Customer thinks "Yes, that's exactly my situation. None of
those work well for me."
```

#### Step 3: The Perfect World

```
## Step 3: The Perfect World

**Purpose:** Define the buying criteria BEFORE introducing your product.
This "rigs the game" in your favor.

**Format:**
"In a perfect world, you would be able to..."
"What if you could..."
"Ideally, a solution would..."

**Key Principle:**
The "Perfect World" describes capabilities that YOUR product delivers
uniquely well. You're setting up criteria that favor your differentiation.

**Structure:**
1. [Capability that solves pain point 1]
2. [Capability that solves pain point 2]
3. [Capability that solves pain point 3]

**Examples:**

Data Platform:
"In a perfect world, you could:
- Handle this volume automatically without adding headcount
- Get real-time visibility instead of monthly reports
- Trust the data without manual verification"

Security:
"Ideally, you'd have:
- A single view across all your tools
- AI that filters real threats from noise
- Response times in minutes, not days"

**Why This Matters:**
When you later present your product, the customer evaluates it against
the criteria YOU just established—not criteria from RFPs or competitors.
```

---

### Phase 2: THE FOLLOW-THROUGH (The Solution)

**Purpose:** Present your product as the answer to the Perfect World criteria.

#### Step 4: The Introduction

```
## Step 4: The Introduction

**Purpose:** Now—and ONLY now—introduce your product.

**Format:**
"That's exactly why we built [Product Name]."
"[Product Name] is a [Market Category] that [one-line value prop]."
"We created [Product Name] specifically to [deliver Perfect World]."

**Key Elements:**
1. Product Name
2. Market Category (from Positioning Canvas Component 5)
3. One-line connection to the Perfect World

**Examples:**

"That's exactly why we built DataSync—a real-time data operations
platform that gives you complete visibility without adding headcount."

"Introducing SecurityHub—a unified threat intelligence platform that
turns 76 tools into one command center."

**Warning:**
Keep it brief. This is not the feature dump. Just enough to categorize
what you are and bridge to the differentiation.
```

#### Step 5: Differentiated Value

```
## Step 5: Differentiated Value

**Purpose:** Show how the product delivers the "Perfect World" using
your Unique Attributes.

**Structure:**
For each Perfect World criterion, show:
1. The capability (what it does)
2. The unique attribute (how it works)
3. The value (why it matters)

**Format:**
"We do this via our [Unique Attribute], which means [Value]."
"Unlike [alternative], we [differentiation], so you get [benefit]."

**Template:**

| Perfect World Criterion | Unique Attribute | Delivered Value |
|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| [From Step 3] | [Technical differentiator] | [Business outcome] |
| [From Step 3] | [Process differentiator] | [Business outcome] |
| [From Step 3] | [Model differentiator] | [Business outcome] |

**Examples:**

DataSync:
"Remember we said you'd want to handle volume without headcount?
We do this via our AI-powered data matching engine, which runs
continuously and learns your data patterns. This means you can
process 10x the data with the same team."

**Key Principle:**
Every element of Differentiated Value comes from your Positioning Canvas:
- Unique Attributes → Component 2
- Value → Component 3
- This ensures Marketing (Canvas) and Sales (Pitch) tell the same story.
```

#### Step 6: Proof

```
## Step 6: Proof

**Purpose:** Provide evidence that your claims are real.

**Types of Proof:**

1. **Customer Stories**
"Here is [Company] that [achieved result]."
- Specific numbers preferred
- Named customers if possible
- Similar industry/size to prospect

2. **Third-Party Validation**
- Analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)
- Industry awards
- Certifications

3. **Demos/Trials**
"Let me show you exactly how this works..."
- Self-evident proof is powerful
- Seeing is believing

4. **Data**
- Benchmarks
- Performance metrics
- Before/after comparisons

**Format:**
"Don't just take my word for it. Here's what happened when [Customer]
implemented this..."

"[Customer Name], a [similar company], saw [specific result] within
[timeframe]. Here's their quote: [testimonial]"

**Examples:**

"Memorial Hospital implemented DataSync last year. They reduced their
data processing time from 4 days to 4 hours—a 24x improvement. Their
VP of Operations said: 'We finally trust our numbers.'"

**Warning:**
- Proof must be relevant to THIS prospect
- Generic case studies don't convince
- Match proof to prospect's industry/size/situation
```

#### Step 7: Objections

```
## Step 7: Objections (Pre-Handling Resistance)

**Purpose:** Address concerns BEFORE they derail the conversation.

**Format:**
"You might be wondering about [common objection]..."
"A question we often get is..."
"I know what you're thinking: [objection]. Here's how we handle that..."

**Common Objection Categories:**

1. **Integration/Implementation**
"How long does this take to implement?"
"Will it work with our existing tools?"

2. **Security/Compliance**
"Is this SOC 2 compliant?"
"Where is data stored?"

3. **Cost/ROI**
"What's the total cost of ownership?"
"How do we measure success?"

4. **Change Management**
"How do we get the team to adopt this?"
"What about training?"

**Pre-Handling Template:**

"You might be worried about implementation time. Most of our customers
go live in [timeframe]. Here's why: [reason]. And we provide [support]."

**Examples:**

"You might be thinking: 'This sounds great, but we've tried platforms
before and they take forever to implement.' I get it. That's why we
built a 14-day rapid deployment program. We've done this 200 times.
Here's exactly what the first two weeks look like..."

**Key Principle:**
Address the top 2-3 objections. Don't try to cover everything.
Focus on objections that actually kill deals.
```

#### Step 8: The Ask

```
## Step 8: The Ask

**Purpose:** Close for the next step. Clear, specific, easy to say yes.

**Format:**
"Based on what we've discussed, here's what I'd recommend as a next step..."
"The logical next step would be..."
"Shall we..."

**Types of Asks (Progressive):**

| Deal Stage | The Ask |
|------------|---------|
| Discovery | "Can I schedule a technical deep-dive with your team?" |
| Demo | "Would you like to see this with your own data?" |
| Evaluation | "Can we set up a pilot with your team?" |
| Proposal | "Should I send over a formal proposal?" |
| Close | "Are you ready to move forward?" |

**Effective Ask Structure:**
1. Summarize mutual fit
2. Propose specific next step
3. Make it easy to say yes

**Examples:**

"Based on what you've shared about your data challenges and what you've
seen today, it sounds like there's a fit here. The next step would be
a 2-hour technical session with your data team where we can map this
to your specific use case. Do you have time next week?"

"You mentioned Q2 is your planning cycle. To make that timeline work,
I'd recommend we do a 30-day pilot starting January 15th. I can have
a proposal to you by Friday. Sound good?"

**Warning:**
- Always have a clear next step
- Make the ask specific (not "let me know")
- Match urgency to their timeline
```

### Positioning to Pitch Translation

```
## How Canvas Maps to Pitch

Every pitch element comes from the Positioning Canvas:

| Positioning Component | Pitch Element |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Component 1: Competitive Alternatives | Step 2: The Alternatives |
| Component 2: Unique Attributes | Step 5: Differentiated Value |
| Component 3: Value | Step 5: Differentiated Value |
| Component 4: Target Market | Who you're pitching to |
| Component 5: Market Category | Step 4: The Introduction |
| Component 6: Trends | Step 1: The Insight |

**Result:** Marketing (Canvas) and Sales (Pitch) tell the exact same story.
```

## Examples

### Example 1: B2B SaaS Security Platform

**Context:** Selling unified security platform to enterprise CISO

**The Complete Pitch:**

**Step 1 - Insight:**
"We've been talking to CISOs all year, and there's a pattern. The average enterprise now runs 76 different security tools. And yet—breach rates have never been higher. More tools isn't making you safer. It's making you slower."

**Step 2 - Alternatives:**
"What we see teams doing: adding more point solutions, hiring more analysts, building internal dashboards. But here's what happens:
- More tools = more alerts = more fatigue
- More analysts = talent wars you can't win
- Internal tools = maintenance nightmare"

**Step 3 - Perfect World:**
"Ideally, you'd have:
- A single pane of glass across all your tools
- AI that separates real threats from noise
- Response times in minutes, not days
- Your existing team 10x more effective"

**Step 4 - Introduction:**
"That's exactly why we built ThreatHub—a unified security intelligence platform that turns your 76 tools into one command center."

**Step 5 - Differentiated Value:**
"Here's how we deliver on that:
- **Single View**: Our integration fabric connects to 200+ tools in days, not months. You see everything in one dashboard.
- **AI Triage**: Our ML models learn your environment and filter 95% of noise. Your team only sees what matters.
- **Rapid Response**: Automated playbooks cut response from hours to minutes."

**Step 6 - Proof:**
"Don't take my word for it. Acme Financial—similar size, similar stack—deployed ThreatHub last quarter. They reduced their mean time to respond from 4 hours to 12 minutes. Their CISO said: 'We finally feel like we're ahead of the attackers instead of chasing them.'"

**Step 7 - Objections:**
"You might be thinking: 'We've tried platforms before—they never integrate as promised.' That's fair. Here's what's different: we guarantee integration with your top 20 tools in 14 days or we pause the contract. We've done this 150 times."

**Step 8 - Ask:**
"Based on what you've shared about your current challenges, there's clearly a fit. The next step would be a technical session with your security architects where we map this to your specific stack. Can you get them on a call next Tuesday or Wednesday?"

---

### Example 2: HR Tech Platform

**Context:** Selling employee experience platform to VP HR

**Step 1 - Insight:**
"Remote and hybrid work changed everything about how employees experience culture. The old playbook—office perks, in-person town halls, casual conversations—doesn't work when half your team is distributed."

**Step 2 - Alternatives:**
"Most companies try to adapt with Slack channels, occasional surveys, and virtual happy hours. But what we're hearing is:
- Engagement scores are dropping
- New hires feel disconnected
- Culture is becoming fragmented by location"

**Step 3 - Perfect World:**
"What if you could:
- Pulse-check culture continuously, not annually
- Give managers real-time visibility into team health
- Create connection across locations without more meetings"

**Step 4 - Introduction:**
"That's why we built CultureOS—an employee experience platform designed for the distributed workplace."
