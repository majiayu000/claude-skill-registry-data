# Copy Frameworks

> Master the essential copywriting frameworks used by top marketers. AIDA, PAS, PASTOR, BAB, FAB, and 4Ps—the building blocks of persuasive copy.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing sales copy and need a proven structure
- Structuring landing pages, emails, or ads
- Overcoming writer's block by following a formula
- Teaching copywriting fundamentals to your team
- Reviewing copy to identify structural weaknesses
- Creating templates for repeatable content

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: Industry consensus compiled from Claude Hopkins, Eugene Schwartz, Gary Halbert, Dan Kennedy, and modern digital marketing practitioners.

**Core Principle**: Great copy follows predictable psychological patterns. These frameworks encode decades of tested persuasion sequences into repeatable structures.

**Why This Matters**: Starting from scratch every time is inefficient and risky. Frameworks give you a proven skeleton—you add the creative muscle.


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Applies the right framework** - Matches structure to context
2. **Expands each framework element** - Turns acronyms into actionable copy
3. **Combines frameworks** - Uses hybrid approaches for complex situations
4. **Reviews existing copy** - Diagnoses structural problems
5. **Creates framework-based templates** - Reusable copy structures

## How to Use

### Choose the Right Framework
```
Help me choose a copy framework for:
Offer: [description]
Goal: [conversion, awareness, etc.]
Audience temperature: [cold, warm, hot]
```

### Apply a Specific Framework
```
Write copy using [AIDA/PAS/PASTOR/BAB/FAB/4Ps] for:
Product: [description]
Audience: [who]
Key benefit: [main value prop]
```

### Review Copy Structure
```
Analyze this copy against standard frameworks and identify what's missing:
[paste copy]
```

## Instructions

When helping with copy frameworks, apply these structures precisely:

### Framework 1: AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

```
## AIDA Framework

**Best For**: General-purpose copy, ads, landing pages, email
**Invented By**: E. St. Elmo Lewis (1898)
**When to Use**: Most situations—this is the foundational framework

### A - ATTENTION
Capture immediate focus. Use:
- Shocking statistic
- Bold claim
- Pattern interrupt
- Direct address of pain point

**Time**: 0-3 seconds
**Goal**: Stop the scroll

### I - INTEREST
Build engagement with relevant details:
- Expand on the hook
- Show you understand their situation
- Introduce curiosity gap
- Present the opportunity

**Time**: 3-30 seconds
**Goal**: Keep them reading

### D - DESIRE
Create emotional want:
- Paint the after-state vividly
- Use social proof
- Stack benefits
- Show transformation

**Time**: 30 seconds - 2 minutes
**Goal**: Make them WANT it

### A - ACTION
Tell them exactly what to do:
- Clear CTA
- Remove friction
- Add urgency/scarcity
- Handle final objections

**Time**: Final moments
**Goal**: Get the conversion
```

**AIDA Template**:
```
[ATTENTION: Hook/headline that stops them]

[INTEREST: "Here's the thing..." or "You've probably noticed..."]

[DESIRE: "Imagine..." or "What if you could..." + benefits + proof]

[ACTION: "Click here to..." or "Get started now by..."]
```

### Framework 2: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

```
## PAS Framework

**Best For**: Pain-driven products, B2B, consulting, SaaS
**Popularized By**: Dan Kennedy
**When to Use**: When the problem is clear and painful

### P - PROBLEM
State the problem clearly:
- Show you understand their pain
- Be specific (not generic)
- Use their language

**Example**: "Your inbox has 1,847 unread emails. You can't find anything. Important things slip through the cracks."

### A - AGITATE
Twist the knife (ethically):
- Explore consequences
- Show what happens if unsolved
- Create emotional resonance
- Make the pain vivid

**Example**: "Every day it gets worse. You miss a client email. Then another. You spend 3 hours just searching for that one attachment..."

### S - SOLUTION
Present your offering as the answer:
- Clear link to the problem
- Specific mechanism
- Proof it works

**Example**: "Inbox Zero Pro categorizes, prioritizes, and auto-responds in your voice. Users report 4.2 fewer hours per week in email."
```

**PAS Template**:
```
[PROBLEM: "You know that feeling when..." or "If you're like most [audience]..."]

[AGITATE: "And here's what makes it worse..." or "The real cost is..."]

[SOLUTION: "That's exactly why we built..." or "Introducing..."]

[CTA]
```

### Framework 3: PASTOR

```

### O - OFFER
Present what they get
- Core offer
- Bonuses
- Guarantee
- Price

### R - RESPONSE
Call to action
- Clear instructions
- Urgency
- Final push
```

**PASTOR Structure**:
```
[PROBLEM: 2-3 paragraphs identifying the pain]

[AMPLIFY: 2-3 paragraphs making it vivid]

[STORY: 3-5 paragraphs with narrative]

[TRANSFORMATION: Before/after + testimonials]

[OFFER: Full offer stack]

[RESPONSE: CTA + urgency + guarantee]
```

### Framework 4: BAB (Before-After-Bridge)

```
## BAB Framework

```

**BAB Template**:
```
[BEFORE: "Right now, you're probably..." or "Struggling with..."]

[AFTER: "Imagine instead..." or "What if you could..."]

[BRIDGE: "Here's how to get there:" or "[Product] makes it happen."]

[CTA]
```

**Example (Software)**:
```
BEFORE: You're spending 10 hours a week on manual data entry. Errors creep in. Reports are always late.

### Framework 5: FAB (Features-Advantages-Benefits)

```

**FAB Copy Flow**:
```

### Framework Selection Guide

```
## Which Framework to Use?

| Situation | Best Framework | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| General landing page | AIDA | Versatile, proven |
| Pain-driven product | PAS | Emphasizes problem |
| Long sales page | PASTOR | Complete persuasion arc |
| Short ad/email | BAB | Maximum impact, minimum words |
| Technical product | FAB | Translates features to value |
| High-ticket offer | 4Ps | Thorough proof-building |
| Cold audience | PAS or PASTOR | Need more problem setup |
| Warm audience | BAB or AIDA | Can move faster |
| Hot audience | FAB | They want specifics |
```

## Examples

### Example 1: PAS for B2B SaaS

**Context**: Landing page for project management software targeting overwhelmed managers

**Input**:
> Write PAS copy for a project management tool. Audience: stressed project managers. Key benefit: visibility into all projects.

**Output**:

**PROBLEM:**
You're running three projects. Maybe five. You've lost count.

Every morning starts with the same panic: "What did I miss?" You check Slack. Then email. Then that spreadsheet someone shared. Then the other spreadsheet. By 10 AM, you still don't know what's actually on track.

**AGITATE:**
Here's what keeps happening:

The CEO asks for a status update. You scramble. You send something that's 60% accurate. Maybe 40%.

A deadline slips because nobody knew Sarah was waiting on Mark who was waiting on the client who was waiting on you.

Your team thinks you don't have your act together. Maybe they're right.

You tried the sticky notes. The whiteboards. The color-coded calendars. Three different tools that each do part of the job.

Still drowning.

**SOLUTION:**
ProjectLens shows you everything. One dashboard. Every project, every task, every dependency.

Red means late. Yellow means at-risk. Green means on track.

No hunting. No guessing. No 10 AM panic.

When the CEO asks, you show the dashboard. Updated in real-time. Actually accurate.

**Why this works**: Deep problem identification, emotional resonance through specific scenarios, simple solution positioning

### Example 2: BAB for Social Ad

**Context**: Facebook ad for online fitness program

**Input**:
> Write a BAB ad for an online fitness program. Audience: busy professionals who've "tried everything."

**Output**:

**BEFORE:**
Every January, same story. Gym membership. New running shoes. Motivation for exactly 3 weeks.

By February, you're back to takeout and "I'll start Monday."

**AFTER:**
What if you had a body you didn't have to "fix" every new year?

What if getting dressed was fun again?

What if you knew exactly what to eat and how to move—in 30 minutes a day?

**BRIDGE:**
FitFoundation is the last program you'll buy.

Not because it's magic. Because it's built for people who work 60 hours and still want results.

Short workouts. Simple meals. Real coaching.

### Example 3: AIDA for Email

**Context**: Launch email for a new course

**Output**:

**Subject**: The $50K skill nobody teaches

**ATTENTION:**
In 2023, I made $127,000 from one skill.

Not coding. Not design. Not sales.

**INTEREST:**
It's the skill behind every successful launch, every viral post, every product that "sells itself."

And almost nobody teaches it properly.

I know because I tried to learn it. Bought 14 courses. Read 30 books. Most of it was theory. Or outdated. Or flat-out wrong.

So I figured it out myself. Took 4 years.

**DESIRE:**
Now I've packaged those 4 years into 6 weeks.

The Persuasion Playbook gives you:
- The exact frameworks I use for $20K+ sales pages
- 127 templates you can swipe today
- Weekly live reviews of YOUR copy
- Lifetime access + updates

Students average a 47% conversion lift in 60 days.

**ACTION:**
Doors close Friday.

Once they're closed, they're closed until September.
