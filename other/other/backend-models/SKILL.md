name: backend-models
description: Define database models and ORM entities with proper naming, relationships, validation, and data integrity constraints. Use this skill when creating or modifying model classes, database table definitions, model relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many), data validation rules, database constraints, or model methods. Apply when working with ORM model files, ActiveRecord, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, Prisma schemas, or any database model definitions that map objects to database tables and enforce data structure and relationships.

- When implementing timestamps (created_at, updated_at) on models
- When setting up foreign keys and database-level constraints
- When choosing appropriate data types for model attributes
- When creating indexes on model fields for query optimization
- When defining cascade behaviors for related records
- When implementing model methods, scopes, or query helpers
- When refactoring model structure for better data integrity
- When working with ORM configuration files or schema definitions

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend models.
