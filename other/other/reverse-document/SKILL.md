# Reverse Documentation

This skill analyzes existing implementation (code, prototypes, systems) and generates
appropriate design or architecture documentation. Use this when:
- You built a feature without writing a design doc first
- You inherited a codebase without documentation
- You prototyped a mechanic and need to formalize it
- You need to document "why" behind existing code

---

## Workflow

### 1. Parse Arguments

**Format**: `/reverse-document <type> <path>`

**Type options**:
- `design` → Generate a game design document (GDD section)
- `architecture` → Generate an Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
- `concept` → Generate a concept document from prototype

**Path**: Directory or file to analyze
- `src/gameplay/combat/` → All combat-related code
- `src/core/event-system.cpp` → Specific file
- `prototypes/stealth-mech/` → Prototype directory

**Examples**:
```bash
/reverse-document design src/gameplay/magic-system
/reverse-document architecture src/core/entity-component
/reverse-document concept prototypes/vehicle-combat
```

### 2. Analyze Implementation

**Read and understand the code/prototype**:

**For design docs (GDD):**
- Identify mechanics, rules, formulas
- Extract gameplay values (damage, cooldowns, ranges)
- Find state machines, ability systems, progression
- Detect edge cases handled in code
- Map dependencies (what systems interact?)

**For architecture docs (ADR):**
- Identify patterns (ECS, singleton, observer, etc.)
- Understand technical decisions (threading, serialization, etc.)
- Map dependencies and coupling
- Assess performance characteristics
- Find constraints and trade-offs

**For concept docs (prototype analysis):**
- Identify core mechanic
- Extract emergent gameplay patterns
- Note what worked vs what didn't
- Find technical feasibility insights
- Document player fantasy / feel

### 3. Ask Clarifying Questions (Collaborative Protocol)

**DO NOT** just describe the code. **ASK** about intent:

**Design questions**:
- "I see a stamina system that depletes during combat. Was this for:
  - Pacing (prevent spam)?
  - Resource management (strategic depth)?
  - Or something else?"
- "The stagger mechanic seems central. Is this a core pillar, or supporting feature?"
- "Damage scales exponentially with level. Intentional power fantasy, or needs rebalancing?"

**Architecture questions**:
- "You're using a service locator pattern. Was this chosen for:
  - Testability (mock dependencies)?
  - Decoupling (reduce hard references)?
  - Or inherited from existing code?"
- "I see manual memory management instead of smart pointers. Performance requirement, or legacy?"

**Concept questions**:
- "The prototype emphasizes stealth over combat. Is that the intended pillar?"
- "Players seem to exploit the grappling hook for speed. Feature or bug?"

### 4. Present Findings

Before drafting, show what you discovered:

```
I've analyzed src/gameplay/combat/. Here's what I found:

MECHANICS IMPLEMENTED:
- 3-hit combo system with timing windows
- Guard-break mechanic (heavy attack vs blocking enemy)
- Stamina system (depletes on attack/dodge, regens when idle)
- Stagger system (builds up, triggers vulnerable state)

FORMULAS DISCOVERED:
- Damage = Base * (1 + StrengthScaling * Level)
- Stagger buildup = AttackStaggerValue / (Enemy.Poise * 0.5)
- Stamina cost = BaseStaminaCost * (1 - EfficiencyBonus)

UNCLEAR INTENT AREAS:
1. Stamina system — pacing or resource management?
2. Stagger — core pillar or supporting feature?
3. Damage scaling — power fantasy or needs tuning?

Before I draft the design doc, could you clarify these points?
```

Wait for user to clarify intent before drafting.

### 5. Draft Document Using Template

Based on type, use appropriate template:

| Type | Template | Output Path |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `design` | `templates/design-doc-from-implementation.md` | `design/gdd/[system-name].md` |
| `architecture` | `templates/architecture-doc-from-code.md` | `docs/architecture/[decision-name].md` |
| `concept` | `templates/concept-doc-from-prototype.md` | `prototypes/[name]/CONCEPT.md` or `design/concepts/[name].md` |

**Draft structure**:
- Capture **what exists** (mechanics, patterns, implementation)
- Document **why it exists** (intent clarified with user)
- Identify **what's missing** (edge cases not handled, gaps in design)
- Flag **follow-up work** (balance tuning, missing features)

### 6. Show Draft and Request Approval

**Collaborative protocol**:
```
I've drafted the combat system design doc based on your code and clarifications.

[Show key sections: Overview, Mechanics, Formulas, Design Intent]

ADDITIONS I MADE:
- Documented stamina as "pacing mechanic" per your clarification
- Added edge cases not in code (what if stamina hits 0 mid-combo?)
- Flagged balance concern: exponential damage scaling at high levels

SECTIONS MARKED AS INCOMPLETE:
- "Enemy AI interaction with stagger" (not fully implemented yet)
- "Weapon variety and scaling" (only sword implemented so far)

May I write this to design/gdd/combat-system.md?
```

Wait for approval. User may request changes before writing.

### 7. Write Document with Metadata

When approved, write the file with special markers:

```markdown
---
status: reverse-documented
source: src/gameplay/combat/
date: 2026-02-13
verified-by: [User name]
---

# Combat System Design

> **Note**: This document was reverse-engineered from the existing implementation.
> It captures current behavior and clarified design intent. Some sections may be
> incomplete where implementation is partial or intent was unclear.

[Rest of document...]
```

### 8. Flag Follow-Up Work

After writing, suggest next steps:

```
✅ Written to design/gdd/combat-system.md

FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDED:
1. Run /balance-check on combat formulas (exponential scaling concern)
2. Create ADR for stamina system architecture decision
3. Implement missing edge cases:
   - Stamina depletion mid-combo behavior
   - Stagger state during dodge
4. Extend design doc when weapon variety is implemented

Would you like me to tackle any of these now?
```

## Template Selection Logic

| If analyzing... | Use template... | Because... |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| `src/gameplay/*` | design-doc-from-implementation.md | Gameplay mechanics → GDD |
| `src/core/*`, `src/ai/*` | architecture-doc-from-code.md | Core systems → ADR |
| `prototypes/*` | concept-doc-from-prototype.md | Experiments → concept doc |
| `src/networking/*` | architecture-doc-from-code.md | Technical systems → ADR |
| `src/ui/*` | design-doc-from-implementation.md | UI/UX → design spec |

## Example Session: Reverse-Document Combat Code

```
User: /reverse-document design src/gameplay/combat

Agent: I'll analyze your combat implementation to create a design doc.
       [Reads code, discovers mechanics, formulas]

Agent: I've analyzed src/gameplay/combat/. Here's what I found:
       [Shows mechanics, formulas, unclear areas]

       Before drafting, could you clarify:
       1. Stamina system intent?
       2. Is stagger a core pillar?
       3. Damage scaling — intentional or needs tuning?

User: 1. Stamina is for pacing, prevent button mashing
      2. Stagger is core — I want deliberate combat
      3. Yeah, exponential is too much, should be linear

Agent: Perfect, that clarifies the vision. Let me draft the design doc.
       [Shows draft with clarified intent]

       May I write this to design/gdd/combat-system.md?

User: Yes, write it.

Agent: ✅ Written to design/gdd/combat-system.md
       ✅ Marked as [REVERSE-DOCUMENTED]
       ✅ Flagged damage scaling for rebalancing

       Next steps:
       - Update damage formula to linear scaling
       - Run /balance-check to validate progression curve
       - Document stagger as core pillar in game-pillars.md
```

## Collaborative Protocol

This skill follows the collaborative design principle:

1. **Analyze First**: Read code, understand implementation
2. **Question Intent**: Ask about "why", not just "what"
3. **Present Findings**: Show discoveries, highlight unclear areas
4. **User Clarifies**: Separate intent from accidents
5. **Draft Document**: Create doc based on reality + intent
6. **Show Draft**: Display key sections, explain additions
7. **Get Approval**: "May I write to [filepath]?"
8. **Flag Follow-Up**: Suggest related work, don't auto-execute

**Never assume intent. Always ask before documenting "why".**
