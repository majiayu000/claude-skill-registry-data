# YouTube Video Ideation (Search-First + Ed Lawrence Method)

Generate video concepts that rank for real search terms AND perform well algorithmically.

## Core Philosophy: Search + Browse

**Every video needs BOTH:**
1. **Search ranking** - Title matches keywords people actually search
2. **Browse performance** - Thumbnail/hook stops scrolling

**Reference file:** `youtube/system/aeo-keyword-data.md` (source of truth for all keyword decisions)

---

## Step 1: Keyword Selection (FIRST)

**Before generating ANY ideas, select the target keyword.**

### Keyword Tiers (from aeo-keyword-data.md)

| Tier | Volume | Growth | Examples |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| **1: Core AEO** | 1K-10K | +900% | answer engine optimization, ai search optimization |
| **2: High Volume** | 10K-100K | +900% | ai seo, google ai overviews |
| **3: Emerging** | 10-1K | +∞ | rank in chatgpt, optimize for chatgpt |
| **4: Comparison** | 1K-10K | +900% | seo vs geo |

### Selection Criteria

**For flagship content:** Tier 1 keywords (own the category)
**For quick wins:** Tier 3 keywords (first-mover, low competition)
**For volume:** Tier 2 keywords (broader audience)
**For conversions:** Tier 4 keywords (comparison = buyer intent)

Document the target keyword before proceeding.

## Step 2: Title Formula (Search-Optimized)

### The Formula
```
[Target Keyword]: [Specific Promise/Outcome]
```

### Examples by Keyword

| Target Keyword | Search-Optimized Title |
|----------------|----------------------|
| answer engine optimization | "Answer Engine Optimization: Complete Guide 2026" |
| rank in chatgpt | "How to Rank in ChatGPT (Step-by-Step)" |
| ai search optimization | "AI Search Optimization: Get Found by ChatGPT & Gemini" |
| seo vs geo | "SEO vs GEO: What Actually Matters in 2026" |
| google ai overviews | "Google AI Overviews: How to Get Featured" |

### Title Requirements

1. **Target keyword appears in first 5 words** (SEO)
2. **Specific outcome or promise** (click-worthy)
3. **No clickbait** (delivers on promise)
4. **Under 60 characters** (doesn't truncate)

---

## Step 3: The 1+1=3 Rule (Thumbnail)

**Title and thumbnail must COMPLEMENT, not repeat.**

| Title Does | Thumbnail Does |
|------------|----------------|
| Contains the keyword | Creates emotional reaction |
| Explains WHAT | Shows WHY it matters |
| Targets search | Stops scrolling |

### Thumbnail Text Rules

- **3-5 words maximum**
- **Does NOT repeat title words**
- **Emotional/stakes-based**
- **Readable at 160x90px (mobile)**

### Examples

| Title | Thumbnail Text (BAD) | Thumbnail Text (GOOD) |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| "Answer Engine Optimization Guide" | "AEO GUIDE" | "NEW SEO" |
| "How to Rank in ChatGPT" | "RANK IN CHATGPT" | "GET FOUND" |
| "SEO vs GEO" | "SEO VS GEO" | "WHICH ONE?" |

---

## Step 4: Concept Generation (5 Variations)

Generate 5 title/thumbnail combinations for the target keyword.

### Variation Types

**Variation 1: Direct How-To**
- Title: "[Keyword]: [Step-by-Step/Complete Guide/How-To]"
- Thumbnail: Action-oriented text

**Variation 2: Transformation**
- Title: "[Keyword] Took This Business From X to Y"
- Thumbnail: Before/after implication

**Variation 3: Data/Research**
- Title: "I Studied [X] for [Keyword] - Here's What Works"
- Thumbnail: Surprising stat or finding

**Variation 4: Problem-Aware**
- Title: "Why [Keyword] Isn't Working (And How to Fix It)"
- Thumbnail: Problem acknowledgment

**Variation 5: Comparison/Contrarian**
- Title: "[Keyword] vs [Alternative]: [Verdict]"
- Thumbnail: Choice/tension

---

## Step 5: Selection (5 → 3 → 1)

### Round 1: Kill List Filter (5 → 3)

**Reject any title that:**
- [ ] Doesn't include keyword in first 5 words
- [ ] Over 60 characters
- [ ] Thumbnail repeats title words
- [ ] No specific promise/outcome
- [ ] Sounds like clickbait

Advance 3 titles.

### Round 2: Read Aloud Test (3 → 1)

Read each title aloud. Ask:
1. Would I click this?
2. Does it sound natural?
3. Does the thumbnail add information?

Select winner.

### Required Elements

|---------|---------------|
| **Your face** | Right 40% of frame |
