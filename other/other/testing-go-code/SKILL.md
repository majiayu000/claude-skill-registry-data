# Testing Go Code

All commands run from the Go module root (`installer/`).

## Unit Tests

```bash
task test                       # Run all tests with race detection
task test -- -run TestName      # Run specific test(s)
task test -- -short             # Skip integration tests
```

For test conventions (naming, assertions, table-driven patterns, mock usage), see the `writing-go-code` skill.

## Coverage

```bash
task cov
```

Runs tests with coverage and opens an HTML report in the browser.

## Benchmarks

```bash
task bench
```

Runs all benchmarks with memory allocation stats.

## Combined Check

```bash
task check
```

Runs tests + lint in sequence. Use before committing.

## Mock Regeneration

```bash
mockery
```

Run from the module root with no arguments after adding or modifying interfaces. Configuration is in `.mockery.yml`. Never edit generated mock files (`*_mock.go`) manually.
