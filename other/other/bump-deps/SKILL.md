# Bump Dependencies Skill

Update Node.js dependencies using taze CLI with smart prompting: auto-apply MINOR/PATCH updates, prompt for MAJOR updates individually, skip fixed-version packages.

When package names are provided as arguments (e.g. `/bump-deps react typescript`), scope all taze commands to only those packages using `--include`.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify taze is installed by running:

```bash
scripts/run-taze.sh
```

If exit code is 1, stop and inform the user that taze must be installed:

- Global install: `npm install -g taze`
- One-time: `npx taze`

## Update Workflow

### Step 1: Scan for Updates

Run the taze script to discover available updates. The script auto-detects monorepo projects (`workspaces` in package.json or `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) and enables recursive mode automatically.

```bash
scripts/run-taze.sh
```

### Step 2: Parse and Categorize Updates

From the taze output, categorize each package update:

| Category  | Version Change                              | Action        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Fixed** | No `^` or `~` prefix (e.g., `"1.0.0"`)      | Skip entirely |
| **PATCH** | `x.y.z` → `x.y.Z` (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`) | Auto-apply    |
| **MINOR** | `x.y.z` → `x.Y.0` (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`) | Auto-apply    |
| **MAJOR** | `x.y.z` → `X.0.0` (e.g., `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`) | Prompt user   |

If package arguments were provided, filter to only those packages.

**Identifying fixed versions:** In package.json, fixed versions have no range prefix:

- Fixed: `"lodash": "4.17.21"` → skip
- Ranged: `"lodash": "^4.17.21"` → process

### Step 3: Apply MINOR/PATCH Updates

Apply all non-major updates automatically without prompting:

```bash
# All packages
taze minor --write

# Specific packages only (when args provided)
taze minor --write --include react,typescript
```

The script auto-detects monorepo mode, but when running taze directly, detect it yourself: check for `workspaces` in package.json or `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and add `-r` if present.

Report the packages that were updated.

### Step 4: Prompt for MAJOR Updates

**Auto-skip packages:** Never prompt for these packages—auto-apply their major updates:

- `lucide-react` (icon library with frequent major bumps, backward-compatible in practice)

For each remaining package with a major update available, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user individually:

```
Package: <package-name>
Current: <current-version>
Available: <new-version>

Update to major version?
```

**Question format:**

- header: Package name (max 12 chars, truncate if needed)
- options: "Yes, update" / "No, skip"
- multiSelect: false

Collect all approved major updates.

### Step 5: Apply Approved MAJOR Updates

After collecting user approvals, apply the approved major updates:

```bash
taze major --write --include <pkg1>,<pkg2>,<pkg3>
```

Add `-r` if monorepo was detected.

### Step 6: Update Bun Catalogs

After applying all updates, check the **root** `package.json` for Bun workspace catalogs. Bun monorepos can centralize dependency versions using `catalog` and `catalogs` fields inside the `workspaces` object:

```json
{
  "workspaces": {
    "packages": ["packages/*"],
    "catalog": {
      "react": "^19.0.0"
    },
    "catalogs": {
      "testing": {
        "jest": "^30.0.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Workspace packages reference these with `"react": "catalog:"` (default catalog) or `"jest": "catalog:testing"` (named catalog).

**Skip this step** if neither `workspaces.catalog` nor `workspaces.catalogs` exists in the root `package.json`.

For each package that was updated in Steps 3/5:

1. Check if it appears in `workspaces.catalog` — if so, update the version there
2. Check each named catalog in `workspaces.catalogs` — if the package appears, update the version there

Preserve the existing range prefix (`^`, `~`, or none) from the catalog entry. For example, if the catalog has `"react": "^19.0.0"` and taze bumped react to `19.1.0`, update the catalog to `"react": "^19.1.0"`.

Use `Edit` to apply the version changes directly to the root `package.json`.

### Step 7: Install Dependencies

After all updates are applied, remind the user to run their package manager's install command:

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
# or
yarn install
```

## Taze Output Interpretation

Taze displays updates grouped by type. Example output:

```
@types/node  ^20.0.0  →  ^22.0.0   (major)
typescript   ^5.3.0   →  ^5.4.0    (minor)
eslint       ^8.56.0  →  ^8.57.0   (patch)
```

The rightmost column indicates update type (major/minor/patch).

Packages shown with `--include-locked` that have no `^` or `~` are fixed versions—skip these entirely.

## Script Reference

| Script                | Purpose                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/run-taze.sh` | Run taze in non-interactive mode, check installation |

## Important Notes

- Fixed-version dependencies (no `^` or `~`) indicate intentional pinning—never modify these
- MAJOR updates may contain breaking changes—always prompt the user
- MINOR/PATCH updates are backward-compatible by semver convention—safe to auto-apply
- The `--include` flag accepts comma-separated package names or regex patterns
- Monorepo detection is automatic—no flag needed
- Bun catalogs (`workspaces.catalog` / `workspaces.catalogs`) are the source of truth for workspace packages using the `catalog:` protocol—always update catalog entries alongside regular deps
