Name: Core Feature Specifications
Description: This document outlines the foundational features for the Antifragile learning and reflection platform. The core philosophy is based on Nassim Taleb’s concept of Antifragility: systems that gain from disorder, stressors, and volatility.

## Volatility Harvesting Journal
Goal: Transform setbacks into actionable intelligence (Post-Traumatic Growth).

The Mechanic: A specialized entry system that moves beyond standard journaling. When a user logs a "stressor" or setback, the AI performs a Signal-to-Noise analysis.

The Antifragile Edge: * Identifies Information Gain from failures.

Visualizes a Growth-to-Stress Ratio.

Helps users see that breakthroughs are often "convex" responses to stress.

SaaS Value: High emotional ROI; transforms the app from a diary into a resilience engine.

## Barbell Strategy Decision Matrix
Goal: Risk management through extreme dualities (Convexity & Optionality).

The Mechanic: A split-interface planning tool.

Side A (90% - Hyper-Conservative): Focuses on "The Floor" (habits, health, financial safety).

Side B (10% - Hyper-Aggressive): Focuses on "The Ceiling" (speculative ventures, radical learning, bold networking).

The Antifragile Edge: Automatically flags the "Fragile Middle"—tasks that carry moderate risk with limited upside (e.g., a stressful job with no growth potential).

SaaS Value: Provides a unique framework for high-performers to manage life/business architecture.

## Via Negativa Auditor (The Subtraction Engine)
Goal: Achieving clarity and strength through omission (Knowledge through Subtraction).

The Mechanic: An AI-powered auditor (via MCP integration) that analyzes schedules, habits, and task lists.

The Antifragile Edge: * Identifies Fragility Points (single points of failure).

Combats Additive Bias (the urge to solve problems by adding more complexity).

Prompts the user: "What can we remove to make this system stronger?"

SaaS Value: Positions the app as a "Clarity" engine, reducing burnout by simplifying the user's life.
