# YAGNI Principle

Only implement features that are explicitly required right now. Avoid adding "just in case" parameters, methods, or abstractions. Don't build for hypothetical future requirements—they often never materialize or differ from predictions. Code that isn't written doesn't need to be maintained, tested, or debugged.
