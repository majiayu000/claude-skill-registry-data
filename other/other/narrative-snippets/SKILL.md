# Narrative Snippets

## Overview

Turn raw source material into structured stories by identifying universal narrative beats. Instead of describing what makes a good story, this skill shows you how to deconstruct and reconstruct them.

**The core insight:** Stories follow predictable patterns. When you can identify those patterns in source material, you can extract and reshape them for any format - blog posts, cold opens, social content, newsletters.

## The Universal Story Structure

Every compelling snippet follows these beats:

### The Six Beats

| Beat | What Happens | Emotional Function |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **1. Setup** | Protagonist in their world, everything seems fine | Establish stakes, create identification |
| **2. Disaster** | Something goes wrong, disrupts the status quo | Hook attention, create tension |
| **3. Failed Approach** | They try the obvious solution, it backfires | Show the old way doesn't work |
| **4. New Insight** | A realization, shift in thinking, or discovery | The "aha" moment |
| **5. Resolution** | They apply the new insight, it works | Payoff, demonstration of value |
| **6. Reflection** | What it means, the takeaway | Universal principle, reader application |

### Example Breakdown

**Raw story from transcript:**
> "I was writing these massive prompts, like 2000 words of instructions. And the outputs kept getting worse. I'd add more detail to fix it, and it would get even more generic. Then I read about how George Lucas directed Star Wars - he showed his crew four films instead of explaining what he wanted. So I tried that with AI - just gave it five examples instead of explaining. Night and day difference."

**Deconstructed:**

1. **Setup:** "I was writing these massive prompts, like 2000 words of instructions"
2. **Disaster:** "And the outputs kept getting worse"
3. **Failed Approach:** "I'd add more detail to fix it, and it would get even more generic"
4. **New Insight:** "I read about how George Lucas directed Star Wars - he showed his crew four films instead of explaining"
5. **Resolution:** "So I tried that with AI - just gave it five examples instead of explaining. Night and day difference"
6. **Reflection:** [Implied: Show, don't tell - examples beat instructions]

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scan for Story Seeds

Read through source material looking for:
- **Transitions:** "Then I realized..." / "That's when..." / "Everything changed when..."
- **Contrast markers:** "Before X, I thought... Now I know..."
- **Failure admissions:** "I tried... it didn't work... so I..."
- **Turning points:** Moments where someone's approach shifted

### Step 2: Extract the Raw Snippet

Pull out the complete story unit - usually 3-8 sentences. Include enough context for the beats to be identifiable.

### Step 3: Identify the Beats

Label each beat in the snippet:

```markdown
**[SETUP]** I was spending hours on detailed prompts.
**[DISASTER]** The outputs kept getting worse.
**[FAILED APPROACH]** Adding more instructions made it more generic.
**[INSIGHT]** George Lucas showed his crew films instead of describing Star Wars.
**[RESOLUTION]** I tried examples instead of instructions - huge improvement.
**[REFLECTION]** Show, don't tell. Examples > descriptions.
```

### Step 4: Reshape for Target Format

**For a cold open:**
Start at the disaster. Drop the reader into tension.
> "The outputs kept getting worse. Every detail I added made them more generic..."

**For a blog introduction:**
Start at setup, compress beats, expand reflection.

**For a social post:**
Insight + reflection only. The "aha" as a standalone:
> "George Lucas didn't describe Star Wars to his crew. He showed them four films. Your AI prompts should work the same way."

**For a newsletter section:**
Full arc, conversational tone, first-person.

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: The Career Pivot Story

**Source snippet:**
> "I was a software engineer making good money but I dreaded Mondays. I tried switching companies three times - same feeling. Then my company did layoffs and I had three months of severance. Instead of job hunting immediately, I took a writing course. Turns out I'd been a writer all along, just hiding in engineering. Now I wake up excited to work."

**Beat breakdown:**
- **Setup:** Software engineer, good money, dreaded Mondays
- **Disaster:** Layoffs, forced pause
- **Failed approach:** Switched companies 3x, same feeling
- **Insight:** Used severance for writing course instead of job hunt
- **Resolution:** Discovered hidden identity as writer
- **Reflection:** Sometimes you need external disruption to find internal truth

### Example 2: The Parenting Insight

**Source snippet:**
> "My daughter was struggling with math. I hired tutors, bought workbooks, sat with her every night. She just got more anxious. Her grades tanked. Then her PE teacher mentioned she learns everything through movement - she's kinesthetic. We started doing math while walking, using her hands to count. Within a month, she was helping other kids."

**Beat breakdown:**
- **Setup:** Daughter struggling with math
- **Disaster:** Grades tanking despite intervention
- **Failed approach:** Tutors, workbooks, nightly help - more anxiety
- **Insight:** PE teacher's observation - kinesthetic learner
- **Resolution:** Math while walking, hands-on counting
- **Reflection:** The solution wasn't more of the same - it was a different approach entirely

### Example 3: The Business Discovery

**Source snippet:**
> "We were losing customers to cheaper competitors. Our response was to cut prices, which killed our margins. Then cut features, which made the product worse. A customer on the way out told me: 'I'd pay double for what you had two years ago.' We raised prices 40% and brought back everything we'd cut. Revenue tripled. The customers who left weren't our customers."

**Beat breakdown:**
- **Setup:** Losing customers to cheaper competitors
- **Disaster:** Revenue declining
- **Failed approach:** Cut prices (killed margins), cut features (worse product)
- **Insight:** Departing customer would pay double for original product
- **Resolution:** Raised prices 40%, restored features, revenue tripled
- **Reflection:** Racing to the bottom attracts customers who were never yours

## Target Formats

### Cold Open (25-35 seconds spoken)

Start at disaster or insight. Create immediate tension or curiosity.

**Template:**
```
[DISASTER - drop reader into problem]
[FAILED APPROACH - show what didn't work]
[HINT AT INSIGHT - create curiosity]
[TEASE - promise resolution]
```

### Blog Introduction (100-200 words)

Full arc, compressed. Setup can be one sentence. Expand reflection.

**Template:**
```
[SETUP - one sentence context]
[DISASTER - what went wrong]
[FAILED APPROACH - brief]
[INSIGHT - the turn]
[RESOLUTION - compressed]
[REFLECTION - expanded, connects to article thesis]
```

### Social Post (< 280 characters or short LinkedIn)

Insight + reflection only. The "aha" as a standalone principle.

**Template:**
```
[COUNTERINTUITIVE INSIGHT]
[WHY IT MATTERS / REFLECTION]
```

### Newsletter Section

Full arc, conversational, first-person if appropriate.

## Finding Snippets in Transcripts

When processing a podcast or interview transcript, search for:

### Signal Phrases
- "The moment I realized..."
- "What changed everything was..."
- "I used to think X, but now..."
- "The mistake I kept making..."
- "Here's what nobody tells you about..."
- "Everyone does X, but actually..."

### Story Structure Markers
- Temporal shifts: "Back then... Now..."
- Contrast pairs: "I thought... Turns out..."
- Admission of failure: "I tried X and it bombed"
- Discovery language: "That's when I learned..."

### High-Value Snippet Types
1. **Origin stories** - How someone started or discovered something
2. **Failure reversals** - Something went wrong, then was fixed
3. **Counterintuitive lessons** - Expectation vs. reality
4. **Before/after transformations** - Clear change over time

## Quality Checklist

Before using a snippet, verify:

- [ ] **Complete arc** - All six beats present (even if some are implied)
- [ ] **Emotional stakes** - Reader cares what happens
- [ ] **Specific details** - Concrete, not abstract
- [ ] **Universal application** - Reflection applies beyond the specific story
- [ ] **Authentic voice** - Sounds like a person, not a summary

---

## Anti-Patterns

### The Fake Story
Don't manufacture details. If the source doesn't have a complete story, note what's missing rather than inventing.

### The Summary
"They learned X" is not a story. Show the journey, don't summarize the destination.

### The Lecture
If there's no setup/disaster, you have an insight, not a story. That's fine - label it as an insight, not a narrative snippet.

### Over-Dramatization
Keep the emotional intensity proportional to the actual stakes. Not every work insight is "life-changing."
