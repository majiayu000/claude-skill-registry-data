# Lean Canvas

> Document your business model on one page and systematically de-risk it. Master Ash Maurya's adaptation of Business Model Canvas optimized for startups and uncertainty.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Starting a new venture** to articulate and test your business model
- **Preparing for customer discovery** to document hypotheses to validate
- **Pivoting decisions** to compare alternative business models
- **Investor conversations** to communicate your model concisely
- **Team alignment** to get everyone on the same page
- **Comparing opportunities** to evaluate multiple ideas systematically

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Ash Maurya - "Running Lean" (2012), adapted from Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas |
| **Core Principle** | "Document your Plan A, identify the riskiest parts, and systematically test them." |
| **Why This Matters** | A business plan is a 60-page guess. A Lean Canvas is a 1-page hypothesis you can test in weeks, not months. It replaces planning with learning. |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Creates one-page business models** - 9 boxes that capture your entire model
2. **Identifies riskiest assumptions** - Highlights what could kill your business
3. **Prioritizes validation experiments** - Focuses on highest-risk unknowns first
4. **Enables rapid pivots** - Easy to update as you learn
5. **Facilitates communication** - Share your model in 5 minutes
6. **Tracks evolution** - Version control your business model thinking

## How to Use

### Create a Lean Canvas for a New Idea
```
Create a Lean Canvas for this business idea: [description]
Fill out all 9 boxes and identify the top 3 riskiest assumptions.
```

### Compare Two Business Models
```
I'm deciding between two approaches:
Option A: [description]
Option B: [description]

Create Lean Canvases for both and compare them on risk and potential.
```

### Identify What to Validate First
```
Here's my Lean Canvas: [paste canvas]
What are the riskiest assumptions? Design experiments to test them.
```

## Instructions

When creating or analyzing Lean Canvases, follow this systematic approach:

### Step 1: Understand the 9 Boxes

```

```

**Key Difference from Business Model Canvas:**
- Replaces Partners/Resources/Activities with Problem/Solution/Key Metrics
- Adds Unfair Advantage
- Focuses on RISK and LEARNING, not operational planning

---

### Step 2: Fill Out Each Box (In Order)

**Recommended Order:** Customer Segments → Problem → Unique Value Proposition → Solution → Channels → Revenue → Cost → Key Metrics → Unfair Advantage

```
## Box-by-Box Guide

### 1. CUSTOMER SEGMENTS
**Question:** Who are you creating value for?

Target customers:
- [Primary segment]
- [Secondary segment if any]

Early Adopters (most important):
- [Specific description of first customers]
- Why they'll buy first: [reason]

Tips:
- Be specific (not "businesses" but "SaaS companies 10-50 employees")
- Identify early adopters who feel the pain most acutely
- If you can't describe them, you can't find them

---

### 2. PROBLEM
**Question:** What problems are you solving?

Top 3 Problems:
1. [Most critical problem]
2. [Second problem]
3. [Third problem]

Existing Alternatives (how they solve it today):
- [Alternative 1]
- [Alternative 2]

Tips:
- List problems from the CUSTOMER's perspective
- If existing alternatives work well, your problem isn't painful enough
- Every problem should be something you've validated (or will validate first)

---

### 3. UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION
**Question:** Why should customers choose you?

Single clear message:
"[We help] [customer segment] [achieve outcome] [unlike alternatives]
[because unique differentiator]."

High-level concept (analogy):
"X for Y" or "Like X but for Y"
Example: "Uber for dog walkers"

Tips:
- Focus on the END BENEFIT, not features
- Make it different, not just better
- Test: Can you say this in 10 seconds?

---

### 4. SOLUTION
**Question:** What are you building?

Top 3 Features (that solve top 3 problems):
1. [Feature → Problem 1]
2. [Feature → Problem 2]
3. [Feature → Problem 3]

Tips:
- Match each solution to a problem
- Keep it minimal - MVP thinking
- This box should be the LAST one you fill with certainty

---

### 5. CHANNELS
**Question:** How will you reach customers?

Path to Customers:
- Awareness: [How they learn about you]
- Acquisition: [How they start using]
- Retention: [How they keep using]

Specific channels:
- [Channel 1: e.g., Content marketing]
- [Channel 2: e.g., Direct sales]
- [Channel 3: e.g., Partnerships]

Tips:
- Start with channels that don't scale (do things that don't scale)
- Match channels to where early adopters spend time
- Free channels first, paid channels when you have product-market fit

---

### 6. REVENUE STREAMS
**Question:** How will you make money?

Pricing Model:
- [ ] One-time purchase
- [ ] Subscription
- [ ] Freemium
- [ ] Transaction fee
- [ ] Advertising
- [ ] Other: ___________

Price Point:
- [Price]: [Justification]

Revenue Formula:
- [Customers] × [Price] × [Frequency] = [Revenue]

Tips:
- Price on value, not cost
- Test pricing early (it's a feature)
- If you can't charge, you don't have a business

---

### 7. COST STRUCTURE
**Question:** What are your costs?

Fixed Costs (monthly):
- [Cost 1]: $___
- [Cost 2]: $___
- Total Fixed: $___

Variable Costs (per customer):
- [Cost per customer]: $___

Customer Acquisition Cost (target):
- CAC: $___

Break-even:
- Need ___ customers at $___ to break even

Tips:
- Keep fixed costs minimal early
- Know your unit economics before scaling
- CAC must be < LTV (lifetime value)

---

### 8. KEY METRICS
**Question:** How will you measure success?

Pirate Metrics (AARRR):
- Acquisition: [How many sign up?]
- Activation: [How many have "aha" moment?]
- Retention: [How many come back?]
- Revenue: [How many pay?]
- Referral: [How many refer others?]

One Metric That Matters (right now):
- [Single metric]: [Target]

Tips:
- Focus on ONE metric at a time
- Vanity metrics (signups, page views) lie
- Measure behavior, not opinions

---

### 9. UNFAIR ADVANTAGE
**Question:** What makes you defensible?

Can't be easily copied or bought:
- [ ] Insider information
- [ ] Dream team
- [ ] Personal authority/brand
- [ ] Network effects
- [ ] Community
- [ ] Existing customers
- [ ] Proprietary tech/data
- [ ] SEO ranking

Your unfair advantage:
- [What is it?]
- [Why can't competitors copy it?]

Tips:
- Most startups don't have one at first (that's OK)
- It often emerges over time
- "Passion" and "first mover" are NOT unfair advantages
```

### Step 3: Identify Riskiest Assumptions

```
## Risk Assessment

### Stage 1 Risks (Product Risk)
"Do I have a problem worth solving?"

| Assumption | Type | Evidence | Risk Level |
|------------|------|----------|------------|
| Problem exists and is painful | PROBLEM | | High/Med/Low |
| Customers are identifiable | CUSTOMER | | High/Med/Low |
| Current alternatives inadequate | PROBLEM | | High/Med/Low |

### Stage 2 Risks (Market Risk)
"Have I built something people want?"

| Assumption | Type | Evidence | Risk Level |
|------------|------|----------|------------|
| Solution solves the problem | SOLUTION | | High/Med/Low |
| Customers will pay [price] | REVENUE | | High/Med/Low |
| CAC is sustainable | COST | | High/Med/Low |

### Stage 3 Risks (Scale Risk)
"Can I build a viable business?"

| Assumption | Type | Evidence | Risk Level |
|------------|------|----------|------------|
| Channels work at scale | CHANNEL | | High/Med/Low |
| Unit economics work | COST/REV | | High/Med/Low |
| Defensibility exists | ADVANTAGE | | High/Med/Low |

### TOP 3 RISKIEST ASSUMPTIONS
1. [Highest risk - validate first]
2. [Second highest]
3. [Third highest]
```

---

### Step 4: Design Validation Experiments

```
## Validation Plan

### For each risky assumption:

**Assumption:** [Statement]
**Risk if wrong:** [Consequence]

**Experiment:**
- Type: [Interview / Landing page / Prototype / Concierge]
- Target: [Who/How many]
- Timeline: [Duration]

**Success Criteria:**
- Validated if: [Specific metric]
- Invalidated if: [Specific metric]

**Next Action:**
- [ ] [Specific next step]
```

**Riskiest Assumptions:**

| # | Assumption | Risk Level | Why |
|---|------------|------------|-----|
| 1 | AI can write emails that perform better than humans | HIGH | Core value prop depends on this |
| 2 | SDRs/managers will trust AI with prospect communication | HIGH | Cultural barrier could block adoption |
| 3 | $99/user is acceptable price point | MEDIUM | Determines if business is viable |

**Validation Plan:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Build prototype, A/B test AI vs. human emails (10 SDRs)
2. **Week 3-4:** Interview 15 SDR managers on trust/adoption concerns
3. **Week 5:** Pricing validation with early adopter interviews

---

### Example 2: Consumer App - Fitness for Parents

**Input:**
> "Here's my Lean Canvas for a fitness app for busy parents. What are the riskiest assumptions?"

**User's Canvas:**
```
Problem: No time to exercise, gym is inconvenient
Customer: Working parents 30-45 with young kids
Solution: 10-minute home workouts, kid-friendly
Revenue: $9.99/month subscription
```

**Output:**

**Risk Analysis:**

**CRITICAL ISSUE: This canvas is incomplete and under-specified.**

**Problems I See:**

1. **Customer segment too broad**
   - "Working parents 30-45" = millions of people
   - Who are the EARLY ADOPTERS who will pay first?
   - Missing: Income level, fitness history, tech savviness

2. **Problem not differentiated**
   - "No time to exercise" is the problem of EVERY fitness app
   - Existing alternatives: Peloton, Nike Training, YouTube, Apple Fitness+
   - Why would someone SWITCH from these?

3. **Solution is a feature list, not a value prop**
   - "10-minute workouts" exists everywhere
   - "Kid-friendly" - what does this actually mean?

4. **Revenue assumptions untested**
   - $9.99/month - based on what?
   - Fitness apps have notoriously high churn
   - Most people don't pay for fitness apps

**Riskiest Assumptions (in order):**

| # | Assumption | Risk | Evidence Needed |
|---|------------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Parents will PAY for yet another fitness app | FATAL | Only 2-5% of app downloaders pay. Need proof of WTP |
| 2 | "Kid-friendly" is a differentiator people care about | HIGH | Does this problem exist? Do they seek solutions? |
| 3 | 10-minute workouts are effective enough | MEDIUM | Will users see results and stay? |
| 4 | $9.99 is the right price | MEDIUM | Could be too high or too low |

**Recommendation:**

Before building anything, validate:
1. **Do parents with kids SPECIFICALLY want kid-friendly fitness?**
   - Interview 15 parents who've TRIED fitness apps
   - Ask: What made you quit? What would make you stay?

2. **Is "kid-friendly" a real differentiator?**
   - What does this mean? Kids do it with them? Kids don't interrupt?
   - Test: Would they pay MORE for this feature?

3. **Willingness to pay?**
   - How many of your target users currently pay for any fitness solution?
   - If <30%, this market may not monetize

**Revised Canvas Hypothesis:**

```
## More Specific Lean Canvas

Customer Segment:
- Primary: Stay-at-home moms, ages 28-40, with kids 2-6
- Early Adopter: Former gym-goers who quit after having kids
  and have tried 2+ fitness apps in past year

Problem (validated):
- Can't workout because toddler interrupts/needs attention
- Guilt about "ignoring" kids to exercise
- Previous apps failed because required uninterrupted time

Unique Value Proposition:
"The only workout you can do WITH your toddler, not despite them."

Solution:
- Workouts designed for parent + kid together
- Toddler becomes part of the exercise (lifting, playing)
- 15-min max, no equipment, living room safe
```

This is more specific and testable.

### Example 3: Pivot Comparison

**Input:**
> "I'm considering pivoting. Compare these two Lean Canvases and recommend which to pursue."

**Canvas A: B2B Analytics Dashboard**
- Customer: Marketing managers at e-commerce companies
- Problem: Too many analytics tools, no unified view
- Solution: All-in-one dashboard connecting GA, FB, Shopify
- Revenue: $299/month
- Unfair Advantage: None yet

**Canvas B: Shopify App for Email Segmentation**
- Customer: Shopify store owners doing 100K-1M revenue
- Problem: Mailchimp/Klaviyo segments are basic
- Solution: AI-powered customer segmentation for Shopify
- Revenue: $49/month
- Unfair Advantage: Shopify partnership potential

**Output:**

**Comparative Analysis:**

| Dimension | Canvas A (Dashboard) | Canvas B (Shopify App) |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Market Size** | Large (all e-commerce) | Smaller (Shopify only) |
| **Competition** | HIGH (Databox, Klipfolio, Geckoboard, custom) | MEDIUM (some apps exist) |
| **Differentiation** | LOW (everyone does "unified") | MEDIUM (AI segmentation specific) |
| **Distribution** | Hard (enterprise sales) | EASIER (Shopify App Store) |
| **Price Point** | $299 (requires sales) | $49 (self-serve possible) |
| **Unfair Advantage** | None | Shopify ecosystem |
| **Time to Revenue** | Longer | Shorter |

**Risk Assessment:**

**Canvas A Risks:**
| Risk | Level | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Building a commodity | HIGH | "Unified dashboard" = red ocean |
| Long sales cycles | HIGH | $299 needs demos, trials |
| Integration complexity | HIGH | Must support many platforms |
| No defensibility | HIGH | Easy to copy |

**Canvas B Risks:**
| Risk | Level | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Platform dependency | HIGH | Shopify could change rules |
| Smaller market | MEDIUM | Limited to Shopify stores |
| AI hype skepticism | MEDIUM | Must prove AI actually works better |
| Low price = high volume needed | MEDIUM | Need ~200 customers to be meaningful |

**Recommendation: PURSUE CANVAS B**

**Reasoning:**

1. **Faster validation:** Shopify App Store = immediate distribution. You can test in weeks.

2. **Clearer differentiation:** "AI segmentation" is specific vs. "unified dashboard" which is generic.

3. **Better path to defensibility:**
   - App Store reviews and ratings compound
   - Shopify partner program potential
   - Data from customers creates better AI

4. **Lower risk profile:** $49 self-serve is easier to sell than $299 with demos.

5. **Pivot optionality:** If it works on Shopify, you can expand to other platforms. If Canvas A fails, you have nothing.

**BUT validate first:**
- Is "segmentation" really the pain point? Or is it "I don't know what emails to send"?
- Do Shopify merchants actually buy apps? What's average spend?
- What's the competitive landscape in Shopify App Store?
