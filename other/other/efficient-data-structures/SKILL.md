# Efficient Data Structures

Match data structures to access patterns: Arrays for ordered, indexed access; Sets/Maps for uniqueness and fast lookup; Queues for FIFO processing; Stacks for LIFO. Consider memory layout—arrays are cache-friendly for iteration. For large datasets, consider specialized structures like tries, heaps, or bloom filters. Understand the complexity of operations on your chosen structure.
