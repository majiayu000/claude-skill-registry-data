# Value Proposition Canvas - Design Offerings Customers Actually Want

> Use Osterwalder's Value Proposition Canvas to systematically achieve product-market fit by matching your products and services to customer jobs, pains, and gains

## When to Use This Skill

- **Launching a new product or service** and need to validate the value proposition
- **Struggling with product-market fit** and need to diagnose why customers aren't buying
- **Repositioning an existing offering** to better meet customer needs
- **Entering a new market segment** with different customer requirements
- **Developing pricing strategy** based on value delivered
- **Aligning teams** around a shared understanding of customer value
- **Preparing for investor pitches** with clear value proposition articulation
- **Innovating on business models** by deeply understanding customer context

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Value Proposition Design (2014) |
| **Experts** | Alexander Osterwalder, Yves Pigneur, Greg Bernarda, Alan Smith - Strategyzer |
| **Core Principle** | "80% of new products fail not because they lack functionality, but because they miss the mark on what customers actually want. The VPC helps you design value propositions that match customers' jobs, pains, and gains." |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures video workflow | Final creative vision |
| Suggests shot compositions | Equipment selection |
| Creates storyboard templates | Brand aesthetics |
| Generates script frameworks | Final approval |
| Identifies technical requirements | Budget allocation |

## What This Skill Does

This skill helps you systematically design value propositions that customers actually want—reducing the risk of building something nobody needs.

You'll learn to:

1. **Map the Customer Profile** - Understand jobs, pains, and gains deeply
2. **Design the Value Map** - Create products, pain relievers, and gain creators
3. **Achieve FIT** - Match your offering to what customers truly value
4. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Focus on what matters most to customers
5. **Test and validate** - Move from assumptions to evidence
6. **Iterate systematically** - Evolve your value proposition based on learning

The result: Products and services that solve real problems customers will pay for.

## How to Use

### Prompt Examples

```
Help me create a Value Proposition Canvas for my [product/service]. My target customer
is [description]. Walk me through the customer profile first, then the value map.
```

```
My product isn't selling. Use the VPC framework to diagnose why. Here's what we offer:
[product]. Here's who we're targeting: [customer]. Help me find the fit gaps.
```

```
I'm pivoting to a new customer segment. Use the Value Proposition Canvas to help me
understand [new segment] and design a value proposition that fits their needs.
```

```
Review my value proposition using Osterwalder's framework. Customer: [description].
Our offering: [product/service]. Does it achieve fit? What's missing?
```

```
Help me prioritize features for my MVP using the VPC. I have these potential features:
[list]. My target customer's main jobs/pains/gains are: [describe].

```

**Golden Rule**: Always start with the Customer Profile (right side) before the Value Map (left side). Understand the customer before designing the solution.

### Step 1: Map Customer Jobs

Customer jobs are the tasks customers are trying to accomplish, problems they're trying to solve, or needs they wish to satisfy.

**Three Types of Jobs:**

| Type | Description | Question to Ask |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Functional Jobs** | Practical tasks with tangible outcomes | "What task are they trying to complete?" |
| **Social Jobs** | How they want to be perceived by others | "How do they want others to see them?" |
| **Emotional Jobs** | Feelings or states they want to achieve | "How do they want to feel?" |

**Job Context Matters:**

The same job in different contexts may require different solutions:
- "Eat lunch" at desk vs. client meeting vs. with family = different needs
- "Manage finances" as student vs. retiree vs. business owner = different needs

**Uncovering Jobs - Questions:**

1. What is the one thing your customer couldn't live without accomplishing?
2. What tasks are they trying to complete in their work/life?
3. What problems are they trying to solve?
4. What needs are they trying to satisfy?
5. What are they ultimately trying to achieve?

**Rank jobs by importance** to the customer (most important → least important).

---

### Step 2: Identify Customer Pains

Pains are anything that annoys customers before, during, and after trying to get a job done.

**Types of Pains:**

| Pain Type | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **Undesired outcomes** | "This doesn't work", "Produces poor results" |
| **Obstacles** | "I don't have time", "I can't afford it" |
| **Risks** | "I could lose money", "I might look foolish" |
| **Frustrations** | "This is too complicated", "I hate waiting" |

**Pain-Finding Questions:**

1. What do your customers find too costly? (time, money, effort)
2. What makes them feel bad? (frustrations, annoyances)
3. What current solutions underperform for them?
4. What are the main difficulties and challenges they encounter?
5. What negative social consequences do they fear?
6. What risks do they fear? (financial, social, technical)
7. What mistakes do they commonly make?
8. What barriers prevent them from adopting a solution?

**Rank pains by severity** (extreme → moderate).

---

### Step 3: Define Customer Gains

Gains are the outcomes and benefits your customers want. They are NOT simply the opposite of pains.

**Types of Gains:**

| Gain Type | Definition | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Required** | Must-have for solution to work | "Phone makes calls" |
| **Expected** | Basic expectations | "Hotel room is clean" |
| **Desired** | Would love but don't expect | "Personalized recommendations" |
| **Unexpected** | Beyond imagination, delighters | "Surprise free upgrade" |

**Gain-Finding Questions:**

1. What savings would make your customers happy? (time, money, effort)
2. What quality levels do they expect?
3. What would make their jobs or lives easier?
4. What positive social consequences do they desire?
5. What do they dream about?
6. How do they measure success and failure?
7. What would increase their likelihood of adopting a solution?

**Rank gains by relevance** (essential → nice-to-have).

---

### Step 4: List Products and Services

Now move to the Value Map. List all the products and services your value proposition is built around.

**Categories:**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Physical/tangible** | Products, devices, equipment |
| **Intangible** | Services, consulting, support |
| **Digital** | Software, apps, platforms |
| **Financial** | Insurance, financing, subscriptions |

**Important**: Products and services don't create value alone—they only create value in relationship to a specific customer segment and their jobs, pains, and gains.

**Rank by importance** to your value proposition.

---

### Step 5: Design Pain Relievers

Pain relievers describe exactly how your products and services alleviate specific customer pains.

**Pain Reliever Questions:**

| Customer Pain | How Do You Relieve It? |
|---------------|------------------------|
| "Takes too long" | → How do you save time? |
| "Too expensive" | → How do you reduce costs? |
| "Too risky" | → How do you eliminate risk? |
| "Too complicated" | → How do you simplify? |
| "Makes me look bad" | → How do you help them look good? |
| "Produces poor results" | → How do you improve outcomes? |

**Creating Effective Pain Relievers:**

1. Produce savings (time, money, effort)
2. Make customers feel better (reduce frustrations, annoyances)
3. Fix underperforming solutions
4. End difficulties and challenges
5. Eliminate risks customers fear

**Focus on extreme pains** that matter most to customers.

---

### Step 6: Create Gain Creators

Gain creators describe how your products and services create customer gains.

**Gain Creator Questions:**

| Desired Gain | How Do You Create It? |
|--------------|----------------------|
| "Save money" | → Reduce costs by X% |
| "Better results" | → Deliver X outcome |
| "Feel confident" | → Provide X support |
| "Look successful" | → Create X impression |
| "Make life easier" | → Automate X task |

**Creating Effective Gain Creators:**

1. Create savings customers value
2. Produce outcomes customers expect or exceed them
3. Outperform current solutions
4. Make customers' jobs or lives easier
5. Create positive social consequences
6. Deliver something customers dream about

**Focus on gains that matter most** and create real difference.

---

### Step 7: Assess FIT

FIT is achieved when your pain relievers and gain creators match important customer pains and gains.

```

│                    ASSESSING FIT                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  Customer's Most Important:     Your Strongest:             │
│  ┌─────────────────────┐       ┌─────────────────────┐     │
│  │ Jobs: _____________│       │ Products: _________ │     │
│  │ Pains: ____________│  FIT? │ Pain relievers: ___ │     │
│  │ Gains: ____________│ ←────→│ Gain creators: ____ │     │
│  └─────────────────────┘       └─────────────────────┘     │
│                                                             │
│  Good fit = You address 50-70% of top pains and gains       │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**FIT Assessment Checklist:**

- [ ] Do your products help customers get important jobs done?
- [ ] Do pain relievers address severe customer pains?
- [ ] Do gain creators create essential customer gains?
- [ ] Is there evidence customers want this? (not just your assumption)
- [ ] Would customers switch from alternatives for your value proposition?

**Three Levels of FIT:**

| Level | Definition | Evidence |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Problem-Solution Fit** | Customers care about these jobs/pains/gains | Interviews, surveys confirm need |
| **Product-Market Fit** | Products/services actually create value | Traction, sales, retention |
| **Business Model Fit** | It's profitable and scalable | Unit economics work |

## Examples

### Example 1: B2B SaaS - Project Management Tool

**Situation**: A startup building project management software for marketing agencies. They've built features but aren't getting traction.

**Customer Profile (Marketing Agency Owners):**

**Jobs:**
1. Deliver client projects on time (functional) - *Most important*
2. Keep clients happy and renewing (functional)
3. Appear professional and organized to clients (social)
4. Feel in control of the agency chaos (emotional)
5. Scale the agency without burning out (functional)

**Pains (ranked by severity):**
1. Projects go over budget/timeline, killing margins - *Extreme*
2. No visibility into what team is working on - *Extreme*
3. Client requests fall through the cracks - *Severe*
4. Switching tools is painful, team won't adopt - *Moderate*
5. Existing tools are expensive per seat - *Moderate*

**Gains (ranked by relevance):**
1. Know project profitability in real-time - *Essential*
2. One place for all client communication - *Essential*
3. Clients can see progress without constant updates - *Desired*
4. Easy onboarding, team actually uses it - *Desired*
5. Automations that save admin time - *Nice-to-have*

**Original Value Map (Pre-diagnosis):**

- Products: Project management software with Gantt charts, time tracking
- Pain Relievers: "Organize projects better"
- Gain Creators: "Comprehensive feature set"

**Diagnosis**: No clear connection to the TOP pains (profitability, visibility) or TOP gains (real-time profitability). Features exist but don't address what matters most.

**Redesigned Value Map:**

**Products:**
1. Project profitability dashboard (real-time margins)
2. Team capacity planner with utilization view
3. Client portal with automatic updates
4. Agency-specific templates (pre-built workflows)

**Pain Relievers:**
- Real-time budget tracking shows burn rate before it's too late → Addresses "projects go over budget"
- Single dashboard shows every project and who's working on what → Addresses "no visibility"
- Automatic client notifications on milestones → Addresses "requests fall through cracks"
- 15-minute setup with agency templates → Addresses "team won't adopt"

**Gain Creators:**
- Profit tracking per project, per client, per team member → Creates "know profitability in real-time"
- Unified inbox for all client communications → Creates "one place for communication"
- Client can self-serve status updates → Creates "clients see progress"
- Guided onboarding with success checklist → Creates "team actually uses it"

**FIT Assessment:**
- Top 2 pains addressed? ✓ Yes (profitability, visibility)
- Top 2 gains created? ✓ Yes (real-time profitability, unified communication)
- Would they switch from Monday/Asana? Needs testing, but strong differentiation on agency-specific needs

**Situation**: A new sustainable clothing brand struggling to differentiate in a crowded market.

**Customer Profile (Eco-Conscious Professional Women, 28-40):**

**Jobs:**

2. Make purchasing decisions aligned with values (emotional)
3. Build a versatile wardrobe without excess (functional)
4. Feel good about environmental impact (emotional)
5. Find quality clothes that last (functional)

**Pains (ranked by severity):**
1. Sustainable brands look "earthy"/frumpy, not professional - *Extreme*
2. Hard to verify which brands are actually sustainable - *Extreme*
3. Sustainable fashion is expensive - *Severe*
4. Don't know how to style sustainable pieces - *Moderate*
5. Sizing is inconsistent online - *Moderate*

**Gains (ranked by relevance):**
1. Stylish clothes I can wear to the office - *Essential*
2. Clear proof of sustainability claims - *Essential*
3. Pieces that work together (capsule wardrobe) - *Desired*
4. Feel proud telling others where I shop - *Desired*
5. Easy returns if sizing doesn't work - *Nice-to-have*

**Value Map:**

**Products:**
1. Minimalist professional capsule collection (blazers, blouses, trousers)
2. Sustainability passport (QR code linking to supply chain transparency)
3. Virtual styling consultations
4. "Cost per wear" calculator

**Pain Relievers:**
- Designs by former luxury brand designers → "Doesn't look earthy/frumpy"
- Blockchain-verified supply chain, factory visit videos → "Hard to verify sustainability"
- Cost-per-wear framing + quality guarantees → "Too expensive" (reframes value)
- Style guides showing how to combine pieces → "Don't know how to style"
- Detailed size guides + free returns → "Sizing inconsistent"

**Gain Creators:**
- Office-ready designs featured in business publications → "Stylish for work"
- Impact report: "Your wardrobe has saved X liters of water" → "Proof of sustainability"
- Curated capsule collections designed to mix/match → "Pieces work together"
- Beautiful packaging + shareable unboxing → "Proud to tell others"

**FIT Assessment:**
- Addresses top pain (frumpy look) with design-forward positioning ✓
- Creates top gain (office-ready) with professional-focused collection ✓
- Differentiation clear: "Sustainable fashion that looks like it belongs in a boardroom"
