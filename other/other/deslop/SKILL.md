# Remove AI Code Slop

Check the diff against main and remove all AI-generated slop introduced in this branch.

## v2.88 Key Changes (MODEL-AGNOSTIC)

- **Model-agnostic**: Uses model configured in `~/.claude/settings.json` or CLI/env vars
- **No flags required**: Works with the configured default model
- **Flexible**: Works with GLM-5, Claude, Minimax, or any configured model
- **Settings-driven**: Model selection via `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` env vars

## What to Remove

- Extra comments that a human wouldn't add or are inconsistent with the rest of the file
- Extra defensive checks or try/catch blocks that are abnormal for that area of the codebase (especially if called by trusted/validated codepaths)
- Casts to `any` to get around type issues
- Inline imports in Python (move to top of file with other imports)
- Any other style that is inconsistent with the file

## Process

1. Get the diff against main: `git diff main...HEAD`
2. Review each changed file for slop patterns
3. Remove identified slop while preserving legitimate changes
4. Report a 1-3 sentence summary of what was changed
