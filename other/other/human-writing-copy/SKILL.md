# Human Writing

Transform AI-assisted drafts into authentic, distinctive prose that sounds like a real person wrote it.

## Core Principle

**Rewrite, don't patch.** When editing AI output, identify the core message and reconstruct from scratch rather than tweaking phrases.

## The #1 AI Tell

**The Correlative Construction:** "X isn't just Y - it's Z"

This is the default structure AI produces. Every AI sample uses it. Eliminate it completely.

- Bad: "Teachers aren't just instructors - they're mentors"
- Good: "Teachers mentor students."

## Forbidden Patterns

### Constructions
- "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- "The truth is..." / "The reality is..."
- "Now more than ever..."

### Rhetorical Flourishes
- "The best part? ..."
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's be honest..."
- "What if I told you..."

### Faux-Dramatic Fragments
- "No fluff. No filler. Just results."
- "Simple. Clear. Effective."

### Openers
- "In the ever-evolving world of..."
- "In today's fast-paced..."
- "Gone are the days when..."

### Formatting
- No boldface for emphasis in body text
- No emojis unless explicitly requested
- No "In conclusion" or "In summary"
- Use hyphens with spaces - like this - not em dashes

## Quick Scan Checklist

Before publishing, check for:
- [ ] Correlative constructions ("not just X, but Y")
- [ ] "Just" appearing more than once
- [ ] Hedge words (might, could, perhaps, possibly)
- [ ] Passive voice
- [ ] Vague claims without specifics
- [ ] Forbidden rhetorical flourishes

## Charlie's Signature Moves

1. **Aphoristic Opening** - Thesis as proverb
2. **Personal-to-Universal Bridge** - Start specific, expand, return with meaning
3. **Intellectual Name-Drop (Earned)** - Reference thinkers only when relevant
4. **Contrarian Hook** - Challenge received wisdom without edgelording
5. **Incarnational Detail** - Specific, sensory, grounding
6. **Self-Deprecating Confession** - Prevents preachiness, builds trust

## Target Tone

A coach who has done the thing and believes you can too. A friend who tells you the truth because he respects you. A fellow traveler, slightly ahead on the path.
