# Aesthetic Motion & Temporal

Define the temporal and kinetic feel of an aesthetic.

## Temporal Dimensions

### 1. Speed Philosophy
- Base Tempo: leisurely, moderate, snappy, frantic
- Speed Range: Slowest to fastest acceptable

### 2. Acceleration Character
- Ease Type: Linear, ease-in, ease-out, custom
- Attack: How motions begin
- Release: How motions end
- Overshoot: Whether elements exceed targets

### 3. Weight & Inertia
- Perceived Mass: Light/floaty vs heavy/grounded
- Momentum: Do elements carry velocity?
- Elasticity: Bounciness level

### 4. Stillness vs Activity
- Default State: Static or subtly animated?
- Idle Behavior: What happens when nothing's happening
- Rest Ratio: Percentage of time things are still

### 5. Rhythm & Timing
- Beat: Underlying temporal rhythm
- Stagger: How sequential animations relate
- Duration Ranges: Short/medium/long motion durations
