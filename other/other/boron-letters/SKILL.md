# Boron Letters Copywriting

> Master Gary Halbert's direct response copywriting principles from "The Boron Letters" (1984). The timeless fundamentals that separate pros from amateurs.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing direct response copy (sales letters, emails, ads)
- Creating headlines that demand attention
- Building mailing lists and segmentation
- Improving copy through the A-pile test
- Learning copywriting fundamentals from scratch
- Diagnosing why copy isn't converting

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: Gary Halbert - "The Boron Letters" (1984)

**Core Principle**: "Become a student of markets, not products." The list matters more than the copy. The A-pile beats the B-pile. Long copy outsells short. And the fundamentals of human psychology never change.

**Why This Matters**: These letters were written in the 1980s but remain the gold standard for direct response copywriting. Halbert's "coat of arms" letter mailed over 600 million times. The principles work because they're based on human psychology, not trends.


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Applies the A-pile test** - Gets mail opened and read
2. **Identifies starving crowds** - Finds markets hungry to buy
3. **Uses the AIDA formula** - Structures persuasive copy
4. **Writes irresistible headlines** - Stops readers cold
5. **Creates long-form sales copy** - Converts readers to buyers

## How to Use

### Apply the A-Pile Test
```
Review this email/letter through Halbert's A-pile framework:
[paste copy]
Will it get opened? Will it get read? What's missing?
```

### Write Sales Copy
```
Write a Halbert-style sales letter for:
Product: [description]
Target market: [who]
Main pain point: [problem]
Unique mechanism: [how it works]
```

### Find a Starving Crowd
```
Analyze this market using Halbert's starving crowd criteria:
[market/niche]
Is this a good market for direct response?
```

## Instructions

When applying Halbert's methods, follow these core principles:

### The A-Pile / B-Pile Concept

```
## Getting Into the A-Pile

**The Reality:** Everyone divides their mail into two piles:

### A-Pile (Opens First)
- Looks personal
- From people they know
- Handwritten or unusual
- Demands immediate attention

### B-Pile (Trash or "Later")
- Obviously promotional
- Mass-produced appearance
- Corporate/bulk mail look
- Easy to ignore

**The Rule:** Your FIRST job is getting into the A-pile.
Nothing else matters if you fail this test.

### A-Pile Tactics

**Physical Mail:**
- Handwritten envelope (or looks handwritten)
- First-class stamp (not bulk mail indicia)
- No teaser copy on envelope
- Real name as sender
- "Lumpy mail" - include physical object

**Email:**
- Personal sender name (not company)
- Subject line like personal message
- No obvious promotional language
- Conversational tone
- Relevant and specific

**Online:**
- Pattern interrupt in first line
- No stock photo headers
- Personal voice
- Addresses reader directly

### The B-Pile Death Spiral

If you look like everyone else, you get treated like everyone else:
→ Ignored → Deleted → Unsubscribed → Forgotten

**Examples:**

| B-Pile (Death) | A-Pile (Life) |
|----------------|---------------|
| "Newsletter: March Edition" | "Quick question for you" |
| "Exciting News Inside!" | "Saw this and thought of you" |
| "Company Name Updates" | "[First name] - about tomorrow" |
| Glossy corporate envelope | Hand-addressed envelope |
```

### The 40/40/20 Rule

```
## What Actually Determines Success

| Factor | Weight | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **List** | 40% | WHO you're mailing to |
| **Offer** | 40% | WHAT you're selling |
| **Copy** | 20% | HOW you say it |

**Implication:**
Finding the right audience matters 4x more than writing brilliant copy.

**The Starving Crowd Beats Everything**

Halbert's Hamburger Stand Test:
"If we were in a contest to sell hamburgers, what advantage would you want?"

Most say: Best meat. Best location. Lowest prices.

Halbert's answer: **"A starving crowd."**

**Lesson:** Find markets with desperate, urgent needs.
The starving crowd will buy despite mediocre copy.

### How to Find Starving Crowds

Look for:
- Urgent pain (not mild inconvenience)
- Emotional investment (identity, fear, desire)
- Recent trigger events (something just happened)
- Demonstrated buyer behavior (already spending money)

**Best Audiences:**
- People who recently bought similar products
- People going through major life transitions
- People with problems that keep them up at night
- People in growing, underserved niches
```

---

### The RFU Formula (List Quality)

```
## Recency, Frequency, Unit

When evaluating a list, look at purchase behavior:

### Recency
How RECENTLY did they buy something similar?
- Within 30 days = hot
- Within 90 days = warm
- Over 6 months = cooling

### Frequency
How OFTEN do they buy in this category?
- Serial buyers = best
- Occasional buyers = good
- One-time buyers = risky

### Unit
How much do they typically SPEND?
- High unit buyers = premium opportunity
- Low unit buyers = volume play

**Best Prospect:**
Someone who recently bought a similar expensive product frequently.

**Example:**
- Bought a $997 marketing course last month (Recency ✓)
- Has bought 4 courses this year (Frequency ✓)
- Average purchase: $500+ (Unit ✓)

→ This person is a GREAT prospect for your $1,500 program.
```

### AIDA in Practice

```
## The AIDA Formula

Halbert used AIDA throughout his work:

### A - ATTENTION (Get the Right Kind)

**Purpose:** Stop them and get them reading.

**Tactics:**
- Pattern interrupts (startling facts, bizarre angles)
- Provocative questions
- Bold, specific claims
- Direct address of pain

**Warning:** Avoid bait-and-switch. The grabber must connect to the message.

**Examples:**
- "At 60 MPH, the loudest noise is the electric clock" (Ogilvy)
- "Do you make these mistakes in English?" (Caples)
- "They laughed when I sat down at the piano..." (Caples)

**Headlines carry 5x more readership than body copy.**
Most people only read the headline. Make it count.

---

### I - INTEREST (Keep Them Reading)

**Purpose:** Build engagement and curiosity.

**Tactics:**
- Educate while entertaining ("edu-tain")
- Tell stories that mirror their problems
- Use specific details (dates, names, places)
- Show transformation through narrative

**The Specificity Principle:**
- Weak: "Lost weight fast"
- Strong: "Lost 23 lbs in 6 weeks—here's what happened on Day 7"

**Story Structure:**
1. Situation similar to reader's
2. The breakthrough moment
3. The transformation
4. What made the difference

---

### D - DESIRE (Make Them Want It)

**Purpose:** Create emotional want for the solution.

**Tactics:**
- Sell benefits, not features ("holes, not drills")
- Bullet points with curiosity hooks
- Future pacing ("Imagine when...")
- Social proof and testimonials

**The Benefit Translation:**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| "24/7 support" | "Never stuck waiting until Monday" |
| "10,000 RPM motor" | "Blend smoothies in 12 seconds" |
| "Cloud-based" | "Access from anywhere, even your phone" |

**Bullets That Create Desire:**
- "The one weird trick that [result]—page 47"
- "Why [common advice] is dead wrong (and what to do instead)"
- "The 3-minute ritual that [impressive outcome]"

---

### A - ACTION (Tell Them What to Do)

**Purpose:** Get the response.

**Tactics:**
- Clear, single call to action
- Remove all friction
- Add urgency/scarcity (if real)
- Make responding easy

**Elements of Strong CTAs:**
- Specific action ("Click the button below")
- Immediate benefit ("Get instant access")
- Risk reversal ("100% guarantee")
- Urgency ("Only 47 left")

**Examples:**
- "Click below to claim your free guide before Friday"
- "Call now—operators are standing by"
- "Enter your email to get instant access"
```

---

### Headline Mastery

```
## Headlines: Where Fortunes Are Made or Lost

**Halbert's Rule:**
"On the average, five times as many people read the headline as
read the body copy."

### Headline Templates That Work

**The "How To":**
- "How to [achieve result] without [common pain]"
- "How I [achieved result] in [timeframe]"

**The Warning:**
- "What NEVER to [do] if you want [result]"
- "Warning: [common behavior] is killing your [thing]"

**The Question:**
- "Do you make these [topic] mistakes?"
- "What would you do with [benefit]?"

**The Number List:**
- "[Number] ways to [achieve outcome]"
- "[Number] secrets of [desirable group]"

**The Story Opener:**
- "They laughed when I [action]—but then..."
- "I was broke, desperate, and about to give up. Then..."

### Headline Testing

Before settling on a headline:
1. Write 20-50 options
2. Sleep on it
3. Read them aloud
4. Test 3-5 against each other
5. Let data decide, not ego
```

### The Hand-Copying Technique

```
## Learning Copywriting From the Inside Out

**The Technique:**
1. Collect successful sales letters (swipe file)
2. Handwrite them word-for-word
3. Do this daily for at least 2 weeks
4. Don't type—handwriting embeds deeper

**Why It Works:**
- Transcends intellectual understanding
- Embeds persuasion patterns in muscle memory
- Forces you to notice every word choice
- Slows you down to absorb technique

**Halbert's Recommendation:**
"Start with 14 classic letters over two weeks."

**What to Copy:**
- Classic direct response letters
- Eugene Schwartz ads
- Gary Halbert letters
- Claude Hopkins ads
- Successful modern sales pages

**The Goal:**
After 30+ letters, you'll start FEELING good copy,
not just analyzing it.
```

---

### Long Copy Wins

```
## Why Length Matters

**Halbert's Rule:**
"Test after test proves that long copy outsells short copy."

**Why Long Copy Works:**
- More information = more persuasion
- Answers objections before they form
- Builds credibility through detail
- Separates serious buyers from browsers

**But Long Copy Must Be:**
- Engaging throughout (never boring)
- Well-formatted for scanning
- Broken into digestible sections
- Filled with fascinations

**Formatting for Long Copy:**

Good:
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Frequent subheads
- Bullet points for benefits
- Bold for emphasis
- White space between sections

Bad:
- Wall of text
- Long paragraphs
- No visual breaks
- Monotonous structure

**The Boring Test:**
Read every paragraph. If you can skip one without losing anything,
cut it. Every paragraph must earn its place.
```

---

### Grabbers and Lumpy Mail

```
## Physical Pattern Interrupts

**The Concept:**
Include physical objects to force engagement.

**Examples Halbert Used:**
- Japanese pennies
- Bags of sand
- Dollar bills attached to letters
- Foreign coins

**Why It Works:**
1. Gets the envelope opened (curiosity)
2. Creates tactile engagement
3. Makes the letter memorable
4. Ties into the message

**Modern Applications:**
- USB drives with video content
- Small branded items
- Unique packaging
- Handwritten notes

**The Rule:**
The grabber must CONNECT to the message.
Random objects without connection = gimmick.
Object tied to your pitch = genius.

**Example Connection:**
- Penny: "Can I give you my two cents about [topic]?"
- Sand: "Is your business built on a solid foundation?"
- Aspirin: "Does [problem] give you a headache?"
```

---

### Research Before Writing

```
## The Preparation Process

**Before Writing a Single Word:**

### 1. Study the Market
- Read what they read
- Join their communities
- Listen to their conversations
- Note the exact words they use

### 2. Collect "Nugget Notes"
Build your ammunition file:
- Proof points and data
- Customer transformation stories
- Emotional triggers
- Specific details and examples
- Objections and concerns

### 3. Amazon Review Mining
Read 1-star and 5-star reviews of competitors:
- What do they love? (Desire)
- What do they hate? (Pain)
- What words do they use? (Voice)

### 4. Forum/Reddit Research
Find where your market congregates:
- What questions do they ask?
- What frustrations do they vent?
- What solutions have they tried?

**The Output:**
A document full of exact phrases, emotional triggers,
and specific details to weave into your copy.
```

---

### The Halbert Writing Process

```
## From Blank Page to Final Copy

### Step 1: Gather Nuggets
Collect all research into one document.

### Step 2: Brain Dump
Write everything without editing.
Get it all on paper. Quality comes later.

### Step 3: Read Aloud
"What happens when you read your copy out loud is that you will
verbally stumble over all the places that are not smooth."

Process:
1. Read aloud
2. Note stumbles
3. Rewrite rough spots
4. Repeat until smooth

### Step 4: The Overnight Test
Sleep on it. Fresh eyes tomorrow.

### Step 5: Cut Ruthlessly
- Remove every unnecessary word
- Delete boring sections
- Strengthen weak claims
- Add proof where thin

### Overcoming Writer's Block:
- Increase font size (psychological boost)
- Use Pomodoro timing (25-33 minute sprints)
- Eliminate distractions
- Accept first drafts are rough
```

## Examples

### Example 1: A-Pile Email Subject Lines

**Context:** Testing subject lines for a product launch email

**B-Pile (Will Be Ignored):**

```
Subject: Exciting News: Our New Product Launch!
Subject: March Newsletter - Big Announcements Inside
Subject: [Company Name] Product Update
Subject: Don't Miss Our Latest Offering
```

**A-Pile (Will Get Opened):**

```
Subject: Quick question about your [specific pain]
Subject: I was wrong about this
Subject: Weird thing happened yesterday
Subject: [First name] - read this before tomorrow
Subject: The $47 mistake I made (don't do this)
```

**Why the A-Pile Works:**
- Looks personal, not promotional
- Creates curiosity gap
- Uses conversational language
- Sounds like it's from a person, not a company

---

### Example 2: Sales Letter Opening

**Context:** Selling a productivity course to entrepreneurs

**Weak Opening (B-Pile):**

```
Dear Friend,

Are you tired of being unproductive? Do you wish you could get more done?
If so, you're going to love what I'm about to share with you...

Introducing the Ultimate Productivity System™...
```

**Strong Opening (A-Pile - Halbert Style):**

```
Last Tuesday, I almost missed my daughter's recital.

I was buried in email. The phone wouldn't stop. And I had three
deadlines breathing down my neck.

At 6:47 PM, my wife called. "You're coming, right?"

I looked at my to-do list. Forty-seven items. Most of them "urgent."

And right then, I decided something had to change.

What I discovered in the next 72 hours shocked me. It wasn't about
working harder. Or waking up earlier. Or saying "no" more often.

It was about one simple shift that the world's top performers use—
but almost nobody teaches.

Let me explain...
```

**Why This Works:**
- Opens with specific story (not generic pain)
- Uses details (Tuesday, 6:47 PM, 47 items)
- Creates emotional connection
- Builds curiosity before selling
- Sounds like a real person

---

### Example 3: Bullet Points (Fascinations)

**Context:** Course sales page bullet section

**Weak Bullets:**

```
• Learn productivity techniques
• Get templates included
• Access to video training
• Bonus materials included
```

**Strong Bullets (Halbert Style):**

```
• The "Two-List" method that freed up 3 hours in my first week—
  and why most productivity advice has this completely backwards (page 12)

• Why your to-do list is making you LESS productive—and the
  counterintuitive fix that actually works (this changed everything for me)

• The 4-minute morning ritual used by a CEO who runs three companies—
  without working weekends (hint: it has nothing to do with meditation)

• "The Batching Mistake": The common efficiency technique that's
  secretly draining your energy—and what to do instead

• How I went from 60-hour weeks to 35-hour weeks while DOUBLING my output—
  without sacrificing quality or burning out
```

**Why These Work:**
- Specific numbers and details
- Curiosity hooks (page references, hints)
- Contrarian angles (common advice is wrong)
- Real stories and transformations
- Promise of specific outcomes
