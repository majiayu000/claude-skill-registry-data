# Git Branch Naming Guidelines

Follow the Conventional Branch specification with these details:

## Prefixes

Except for `main`, all branch names must use one of:

- `feat/`: New features (e.g., `feat/add-login-page`)
- `fix/`: Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/header-bug`)
- `hotfix/`: Urgent fixes (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
- `release/`: Release preparation (e.g., `release/v1.2.0`)
- `chore/`: Non-code tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

## Additional Rules

- Include ticket numbers when applicable (e.g., `feat/issue-123-new-login`)
- Dots allowed only for version numbers in `release/` branches
- Check existing branches for naming patterns before creating new ones
