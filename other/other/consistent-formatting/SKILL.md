# Consistent Formatting

Use automated formatters (Prettier, Black, gofmt) to enforce consistent style. Configure formatting rules in the project and commit the configuration. Run formatters in pre-commit hooks or CI. Don't debate style in code reviews—let tools handle it. Consistent formatting reduces cognitive load and eliminates style-based merge conflicts.
