# KISS Principle

Prefer straightforward, readable solutions over clever or complex ones. Choose the simplest approach that correctly solves the problem. Avoid premature abstraction—don't create factories, builders, or complex hierarchies until the need is proven. If code requires extensive comments to explain, consider simplifying the logic instead.
