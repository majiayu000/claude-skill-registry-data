name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write focused tests for core user flows and critical paths using Pest framework, with minimal tests during development and strategic coverage at completion points. Use this skill when creating or editing test files in tests/Feature/ or tests/Unit/ directories, when writing Pest tests with descriptive names, when testing critical user workflows and business logic, when mocking external dependencies, when implementing fast unit tests, when testing behavior rather than implementation details, or when deciding what needs test coverage at feature completion.

# Testing Test Writing

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.

## When to use this skill

- When creating new test files in `tests/Feature/` or `tests/Unit/` directories
- When writing Pest tests with descriptive, clear test names
- When testing core user workflows and critical business paths
- When deciding what needs test coverage at feature completion points
- When mocking external dependencies (databases, APIs, file systems, services)
- When writing fast-executing unit tests
- When focusing tests on behavior and outcomes rather than implementation details
- When using Pest datasets to handle multiple test scenarios efficiently
- When testing validation rules, business logic, or API endpoints
- When implementing integration tests for critical features
- When running tests before committing code changes
- When skipping tests for non-critical utilities or edge cases (until explicitly required)
