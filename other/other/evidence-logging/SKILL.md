# Evidence Logging

## When To Use
- During any review or analysis workflow to capture reproducible evidence.
- When findings must be traceable to specific commands, outputs, or sources.
- Before finalizing recommendations that stakeholders will act upon.

## When NOT To Use

- Quick informal checks without documentation needs
- Structured output is the focus - use structured-output

## Activation Patterns
**Trigger Keywords**: evidence, proof, trace, audit, reproducible, citation, source, verify
**Contextual Cues**:
- "show your work" or "provide evidence"
- "how can I verify this" or "reproduce these findings"
- "cite your sources" or "where did this come from"
- "create an audit trail"
- "document the steps taken"

**Auto-Load When**: Any analysis requires traceability or when findings need reproducible verification.

## Required TodoWrite Items
1. `evidence-logging:log-initialized`
2. `evidence-logging:commands-captured`
3. `evidence-logging:citations-recorded`
4. `evidence-logging:artifacts-indexed`

Mark each item complete as you finish the corresponding step.

## Step 1: Initialize Log (`evidence-logging:log-initialized`)
- Create evidence structure with timestamp and context:
  - Session ID or review identifier.
  - Repository, branch, and commit hash.
  - Analyst identity and review scope.
- Establish naming convention for evidence references (e.g., `[E1]`, `[E2]`).

## Step 2: Capture Commands (`evidence-logging:commands-captured`)
- Log every command that produces evidence:
  ```
  [E1] Command: git diff --stat HEAD~5..HEAD
       Output: 15 files changed, 234 insertions(+), 89 deletions(-)
       Timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
  ```
  **Verification:** Run `git status` to confirm working tree state.
- Include full command with arguments (no aliases).
- Capture relevant output snippets, not entire dumps.
- Note working directory and environment if relevant.

## Step 3: Record Citations (`evidence-logging:citations-recorded`)
- Log external sources consulted:
  ```
  **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.
  [C1] Source: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/
       Section: "Working with Unsafe"
       Relevance: Validates unsafe block justification
  ```
  **Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.
- Include web searches performed and key results.
- Reference documentation versions (API docs, RFCs, specs).
- Note any AI-assisted analysis with model/prompt context.

## Step 4: Index Artifacts (`evidence-logging:artifacts-indexed`)
- Catalog generated artifacts:
  - Screenshots, diagrams, or visualizations.
  - Exported reports or coverage summaries.
  - Saved query results or API responses.
- Provide file paths or inline content for small artifacts.
- Note artifact retention policy (ephemeral vs. archived).

## Evidence Reference Format
Use consistent format in findings:
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.
Finding: Memory leak in connection pool [E3, C2]
- Evidence [E3]: valgrind output showing 4KB unreleased
- Citation [C2]: PostgreSQL docs on connection lifecycle
```
**Verification:** Run the command with `--help` flag to verify availability.

## Exit Criteria
- Todos completed with structured evidence log.
- All findings traceable to specific evidence references.
- Downstream reports can cite evidence without re-running commands.
## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command not found**
Ensure all dependencies are installed and in PATH

**Permission errors**
Check file permissions and run with appropriate privileges

**Unexpected behavior**
Enable verbose logging with `--verbose` flag
