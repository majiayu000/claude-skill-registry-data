# Financial Model Review Skill

Help startup founders understand how investors will evaluate their financial model — validating structure, unit economics, runway, and metrics against stage-appropriate standards. Produce a thorough review with actionable improvements. The tone is founder-first: a rigorous but supportive coaching session.

## Input Formats

Accept any format: Excel (.xlsx), CSV, Google Sheets exports, financial documents, or conversational input. For Excel files, use `extract_model.py` to parse. For other formats, extract data manually into the `inputs.json` schema. If multiple copies of the same file exist (e.g., `Financials.xlsx` and `Financials (1).xlsx`), use the most recently modified version and note the duplication to the founder.

## Available Scripts

All scripts are at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/financial-model-review/scripts/`:

- **`extract_model.py`** — Extracts structured data from Excel (.xlsx) and CSV files
- **`checklist.py`** — Scores 46 criteria across 7 categories with profile-based auto-gating
- **`unit_economics.py`** — Computes and benchmarks 11 unit economics metrics
- **`runway.py`** — Multi-scenario runway stress-test with decision points
- **`compose_report.py`** — Assembles report with cross-artifact validation; `--strict` exits 1 on high-severity warnings (corrupt/missing artifacts)
- **`visualize.py`** — Generates self-contained HTML with SVG charts (not JSON)

Also available from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/` (shared):

- **`find_artifact.py`** — Resolves artifact paths by skill name and filename (used by Sub-agent B for cross-skill lookups)

Run with: `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/financial-model-review/scripts/<script>.py --pretty [args]`

## Available References

Read as needed from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/financial-model-review/references/`:

- **`checklist-criteria.md`** — All 46 checklist criteria with gate definitions
- **`schema-inputs.md`** — JSON schema for `inputs.json` (the artifact the agent writes)
- **`artifact-schemas.md`** — JSON schemas for script-produced output artifacts
- **`data-sufficiency.md`** — Data sufficiency gate and qualitative path

From `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/` (shared): `stage-expectations.md`, `benchmarks.md`, `israel-guidance.md`, `revenue-model-types.md`, `common-mistakes.md`

## Artifact Pipeline

Every review deposits structured JSON artifacts into a working directory. The final step assembles all artifacts into a report and validates consistency. This is not optional.

| Step | Artifact | Producer |
|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | founder context | `founder_context.py` read/init |
| 2 | `model_data.json` | Sub-agent (Task) + `extract_model.py` (Excel/CSV) |
| 3 | `inputs.json` | Sub-agent (Task, single-pass or two-pass) or agent (heredoc) |
| 4 | `checklist.json` | Sub-agent (Task) + `checklist.py` |
| 5 | `unit_economics.json` | Sub-agent (Task) + `unit_economics.py` |
| 6 | `runway.json` | Sub-agent (Task) + `runway.py` |
| 7 | Report | `compose_report.py` reads all |
| 8 | HTML | `visualize.py` |

**Rules:**
- Deposit each artifact before proceeding to the next step
- For agent-written artifacts (Step 3), consult `references/schema-inputs.md` for the JSON schema
- If a step is not applicable, deposit a stub: `{"skipped": true, "reason": "..."}`
- **Do NOT use `isolation: "worktree"`** for sub-agents — files written in a worktree won't appear in the main `$REVIEW_DIR`

Keep the founder informed with brief, plain-language updates at each step. Never mention file names, scripts, or JSON. After each analytical step (4–6), share a one-sentence finding before moving on.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Path Setup

Define these variables at the start of every Bash invocation:

```bash
SCRIPTS="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/financial-model-review/scripts"
REFS="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/financial-model-review/references"
SHARED_SCRIPTS="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts"
SHARED_REFS="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references"
if ls "$(pwd)"/mnt/*/ >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  ARTIFACTS_ROOT="$(ls -d "$(pwd)"/mnt/*/ | head -1)artifacts"
elif ls "$(pwd)"/sessions/*/mnt/*/ >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  ARTIFACTS_ROOT="$(ls -d "$(pwd)"/sessions/*/mnt/*/ | head -1)artifacts"
else
  ARTIFACTS_ROOT="./artifacts"
fi
```

If `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is empty, fall back: run `Glob` with pattern `**/founder-skills/skills/financial-model-review/scripts/checklist.py`, strip to get `SCRIPTS`, derive `REFS` and `SHARED_SCRIPTS`.

**If `ARTIFACTS_ROOT` resolves to `./artifacts` but no `artifacts/` directory exists at `$(pwd)`:** The workspace may not be mounted yet. Use `Glob` with pattern `**/artifacts/founder_context.json` to locate existing artifacts, and derive `ARTIFACTS_ROOT` from the result. If nothing is found, `mkdir -p ./artifacts` and proceed.

After Step 1 (when the slug is known):

```bash
REVIEW_DIR="$ARTIFACTS_ROOT/financial-model-review-${SLUG}"
mkdir -p "$REVIEW_DIR"
```

If `REVIEW_DIR` already contains artifacts from a previous run, remove them before starting:

    rm -f "$REVIEW_DIR"/{inputs,checklist,unit_economics,runway,report,model_data}.json "$REVIEW_DIR/report.html"

### Step 1: Read or Create Founder Context

```bash
python3 "$SHARED_SCRIPTS/founder_context.py" read --artifacts-root "$ARTIFACTS_ROOT" --pretty
```

Three cases based on exit code:

**Exit 0 (found, single context):** Use the company slug and pre-filled fields.

**Exit 1 (not found):** Ask the founder for company name, stage, sector, geography. When using `AskUserQuestion`, always provide at least 2 options (the tool requires a minimum of 2). Valid `--stage` values: `pre-seed`, `seed`, `series-a`, `series-b`, `later` (hyphenated, not underscored). Then create:

```bash
python3 "$SHARED_SCRIPTS/founder_context.py" init \
  --company-name "Acme Corp" --stage seed --sector "B2B SaaS" \
  --geography "US" --artifacts-root "$ARTIFACTS_ROOT"
```

If the script prints a `sector_type` warning but exits 0, that's non-fatal — proceed without retrying. However, a null `sector_type` may suppress sector-specific checklist gating downstream. If you know the correct type, re-run with `--sector-type` (valid values: `saas`, `ai-native`, `marketplace`, `hardware`, `hardware-subscription`, `consumer-subscription`, `usage-based`).

**Exit 2 (multiple context files):** Present the list to the founder, ask which company, then re-read with `--slug`.

### Steps 2-3: Extract Model Data and Build `inputs.json`

**When Excel (.xlsx) or CSV files are provided,** spawn a `general-purpose` Task sub-agent to handle extraction and input construction. The sub-agent receives: file path, `SCRIPTS`, `REFS`, `SHARED_REFS`, and `REVIEW_DIR` paths. **Do NOT use `isolation: "worktree"`** — files written in a worktree won't appear in the main `$REVIEW_DIR`.

The sub-agent:
1. Runs `extract_model.py` on the file → `model_data.json`
2. Reads `$REFS/schema-inputs.md` for the JSON schema
3. Reads `$REFS/data-sufficiency.md` to assess data sufficiency
4. Constructs `inputs.json` from extracted data, writing it to `$REVIEW_DIR/inputs.json`

Instruct the sub-agent: **Do not run any scripts other than `extract_model.py`. Do not create any files other than `model_data.json` and `inputs.json`.** Before writing `inputs.json`, verify that no numeric field is null when the source data contains a value — null fields cascade into bad downstream outputs (unit economics scores wrong metrics, runway reports infinite runway). Return ONLY: (1) file paths written, (2) company name/stage/sector, (3) `model_format`, (4) data sufficiency verdict (sufficient/insufficient + count of missing critical fields), and (5) any `company.traits` detected — do not echo the full JSON back.

After the sub-agent returns, use the summary to decide the qualitative vs. quantitative path and share a brief update with the founder.

**When documents (PDFs, data room dumps, Google Sheets exports) are provided,** use a two-pass sub-agent flow:

1. **Probe pass:** Spawn a `general-purpose` Task sub-agent with the file path(s), `SCRIPTS`, `REFS`, `SHARED_REFS`, and `REVIEW_DIR` paths. The sub-agent reads the document(s), reads `$REFS/schema-inputs.md` for the schema, extracts what it can, and returns ONLY: (1) partial data extracted (company name, stage, sector, any metrics found), (2) `model_format`, (3) a numbered list of specific questions for missing critical fields (e.g., "1. What is your monthly burn rate? 2. How many paying customers?"), and (4) any `company.traits` detected. Save the sub-agent's ID for resumption.

2. **Ask the founder:** Present the sub-agent's questions in plain language. Collect answers.

3. **Build pass:** Resume the same sub-agent (using `resume` with the saved agent ID — preserves full document context). Pass the founder's answers. The sub-agent reads `$REFS/data-sufficiency.md`, constructs `inputs.json`, and writes it to `$REVIEW_DIR/inputs.json`. Returns ONLY: (1) file paths written, (2) data sufficiency verdict (sufficient/insufficient + count of missing critical fields), and (3) final `model_format`.

After the sub-agent returns, use the summary to decide the qualitative vs. quantitative path and share a brief update with the founder.

**When conversational input is provided (no files):** Handle directly in the main agent — the data is already in the conversation. Ask the founder for any missing fields: revenue figures, cost structure, headcount, funding history, growth rates, key assumptions. Consult `references/schema-inputs.md` for the full schema.

```bash
cat <<'INPUTS_EOF' > "$REVIEW_DIR/inputs.json"
{...inputs JSON — see references/schema-inputs.md for format...}
INPUTS_EOF
```

**Data sufficiency:** After extracting data (whether via sub-agent or directly), consult `references/data-sufficiency.md` to determine if enough quantitative data is available. If 3+ critical fields are missing, follow the data sufficiency gate procedure.

**Setting `model_format`:** `spreadsheet` (Excel/CSV/Google Sheets), `deck` (pitch deck), `conversational` (gathered through conversation), `partial` (incomplete spreadsheet). When `model_format` is `deck` or `conversational`, structural items auto-gate to `not_applicable`.

**AI-powered products:** Include `"ai-powered"` in `company.traits` ONLY if there is explicit evidence in the source files that AI/ML inference is a core product feature — e.g., COGS showing GPU/inference costs, product descriptions mentioning ML models, or inference-related line items. Do NOT infer `ai-powered` from the sector name alone (e.g., "Fintech" does not imply AI).

**Graceful degradation:** If Task tool is unavailable, extract directly in the main agent.

### Step 3.5: Validate `inputs.json` Before Proceeding

Before dispatching Steps 4–6, verify `inputs.json` quality:

1. **Sign conventions:** `cash.monthly_net_burn` must be **positive** (cash outgoing). If negative, fix it: `abs(value)`.
2. **Null critical fields:** Check that `cash.current_balance`, `cash.monthly_net_burn`, `revenue.mrr.value`, and `revenue.growth_rate_monthly` are not null when the source data contains these values. Null fields cascade into bad outputs.
3. **Cash balance missing?** If `cash.current_balance` is null but burn rate is known, **ask the founder** for their current cash balance before proceeding. Runway analysis is central to Series A conversations — a sensitivity table is a poor substitute for the real number.

Fix any issues in `inputs.json` before dispatching the parallel sub-agents. Fixing between sub-agent dispatches (e.g., after checklist but before metrics) breaks the parallel rule.

### Steps 4-6: Parallel Analysis (Checklist + Metrics & Runway)

**IMPORTANT — PARALLEL DISPATCH IS MANDATORY:** Spawn 2 `general-purpose` Task sub-agents **in a single message** — both Agent tool calls MUST appear in the same assistant response. This is not a suggestion. If you spawn Sub-agent A first and wait for its result before spawning Sub-agent B, you are violating this rule. No `isolation: "worktree"`. Each receives the expanded `SCRIPTS`, `REFS`, `SHARED_SCRIPTS`, `SHARED_REFS`, and `REVIEW_DIR` paths.

**Sub-agent A — Checklist Scorer:**

Reads `$REFS/checklist-criteria.md`, reads `$REVIEW_DIR/inputs.json`, assesses all 46 items with evidence, and runs `checklist.py`. **Do not run any other scripts** — only `checklist.py`. Do not create any files other than `checklist.json`.

| Format | Assess | Auto-gated by script |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| `spreadsheet` | All 46 items | None |
| `deck` / `conversational` | 24 business-quality items | STRUCT_01–09, CASH_20–32 (22 items) |
| `partial` | All 46 items | None |

```bash
cat <<'CHECK_EOF' | python3 "$SCRIPTS/checklist.py" --pretty -o "$REVIEW_DIR/checklist.json"
{"items": [
  {"id": "...", "status": "pass", "evidence": "...", "notes": null},
  ...all 46 items...
], "company": {...from inputs.json...}}
CHECK_EOF
```

**Evidence required:** Always provide `evidence` for `fail` or `warn` items.

Instruct Sub-agent A: **Return ONLY a short JSON object** with keys: `path`, `score_pct`, `overall_rating`, `top_issues` (array of max 3 strings). Do not return tables, recommendations, category breakdowns, or any other text. Keep total output under 500 characters.

**Sub-agent B — Metrics & Runway:**

Runs `unit_economics.py`, `runway.py`, and cross-skill lookups.

```bash
cat "$REVIEW_DIR/inputs.json" | python3 "$SCRIPTS/unit_economics.py" --pretty -o "$REVIEW_DIR/unit_economics.json"
cat "$REVIEW_DIR/inputs.json" | python3 "$SCRIPTS/runway.py" --pretty -o "$REVIEW_DIR/runway.json"
```

Cross-skill: Use `find_artifact.py` to locate prior market-sizing and deck-review artifacts. If market-sizing found, compare projected Year 3 ARR against SOM. If deck-review found, cross-reference financial claims. Record findings for coaching commentary. If neither found, note and proceed.

If the main agent indicates the **qualitative path** (data insufficient for quantitative analysis), Sub-agent B deposits stubs instead of running unit_economics/runway scripts: `{"skipped": true, "reason": "qualitative path — insufficient quantitative data"}`

Instruct Sub-agent B: **Do not run any scripts other than `unit_economics.py`, `runway.py`, and `find_artifact.py`. Do not create any files other than `unit_economics.json` and `runway.json`.** After running `unit_economics.py`, sanity-check the burn multiple — if it exceeds 20x for a company with meaningful ARR (>$500K), re-examine the `growth_rate_monthly` and `monthly_net_burn` inputs for unit inconsistency (e.g., monthly vs. annual mixing). **Return ONLY a short JSON object** with keys: `paths` (array), `burn_rate`, `runway_months`, `ltv_cac`, `burn_multiple`, `cross_skill` (string or null). Do not return tables, recommendations, or any other text. Keep total output under 500 characters.

If `runway.py` produces minimal output (< 500 bytes) due to missing `cash_balance_current`, note this gap explicitly — the coaching commentary should address it.

**Graceful degradation:** If Task tool is unavailable, run Steps 4-6 sequentially in the main agent.

After both sub-agents return, share a brief coaching update with the founder before proceeding to Step 7.

### Step 7: Compose and Validate Report

```bash
python3 "$SCRIPTS/compose_report.py" --dir "$REVIEW_DIR" --pretty -o "$REVIEW_DIR/report.json" --strict
```

Check `validation.warnings`: fix high-severity (corrupt/missing artifacts), present medium-severity (checklist failures, runway inconsistencies, metrics gaps) in the report, note low/info. `--strict` only blocks on high-severity warnings — medium-severity warnings like `CHECKLIST_FAILURES` are review findings to present, not data errors to fix. This is a refinement loop — fix high-severity warnings, re-deposit, re-compose. If a warning flags a computed value that looks implausible (e.g., burn multiple > 20x), investigate the source artifact's inputs before re-composing — the fix may be in `inputs.json` or `unit_economics.json`, not in the compose step. If a `RUNWAY_INCONSISTENCY` warning mentions cash direction (cash increasing despite positive burn), check `inputs.json` for null or zero fields that should have values — null fields are the most common cause of phantom 'infinite runway' results.

**Primary deliverable:** Read `report_markdown` from the output JSON, write it to `$REVIEW_DIR/report.md`, and display it to the user in full. **Present the file path** so the user can access it directly. Then add coaching commentary covering: (1) what metrics look strong and why investors will notice, (2) the single highest-leverage fix to improve investor readiness, (3) any data gaps that weaken the story (e.g., missing runway, incomplete unit economics), and (4) what to prioritize before the next fundraise conversation.

### Step 8: Visualize (Optional)

```bash
python3 "$SCRIPTS/visualize.py" --dir "$REVIEW_DIR" -o "$REVIEW_DIR/report.html"
```

**Present the HTML file path** to the user so they can open the visual report.

## Scoring

- Each of 46 items: pass / fail / warn / not_applicable
- `score_pct` = (pass + 0.5 * warn) / (total - not_applicable) * 100
- Overall: "strong" (>=85%), "solid" (>=70%), "needs_work" (>=50%), "major_revision" (<50%)
