# Code Review

## Objective

Find high-impact defects in changed code with evidence. Prioritize security, correctness, and regressions over style nits.

## Arguments

- `--all`: Review all uncommitted tracked changes.
- `--fix`: After reporting findings, apply all suggested fixes automatically in severity order (`CRITICAL -> HIGH -> MEDIUM -> LOW`), then rerun targeted checks and report exactly what changed.
- Default: Report findings and wait for confirmation before editing.

## Scope Resolution

1. Verify repository context: `git rev-parse --git-dir`. If this fails, stop and tell the user to run from a git repository.
2. If `$ARGUMENTS` includes `--all`, scope is `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR`.
3. Otherwise, if user provides file paths/patterns or a commit/range, scope is exactly those targets.
4. Otherwise, scope is session-modified files.
5. Exclude generated/low-signal files unless requested: lockfiles, minified bundles, build outputs, vendored code.
6. If scope resolves to zero files, report and stop. Do not widen scope silently.

## Workflow

1. Resolve scope and read diffs plus minimal surrounding context.
2. Classify files by domain/risk.
3. Load `references/profiles/core.md` plus only the domain profiles that match the current diff.
4. Generate findings with: location, impact, evidence, confidence, and concrete fix.
5. Assign severity with the model below.
6. Default behavior: report and wait.
7. With `--fix`: apply all suggested fixes in severity order, then run targeted verification.
8. Report using `references/output-schema.md`.

## Profile Dispatch

- `references/profiles/security.md`: auth, external input, secrets, crypto, public network surfaces, unsafe parsing.
- `references/profiles/configuration.md`: env/config, timeouts, retries, pools, limits, resource tuning, rollout controls.
- `references/profiles/typescript-react.md`: TypeScript/JavaScript/React/Node files.
- `references/profiles/python.md`: Python services, scripts, async workloads.
- `references/profiles/shell.md`: shell scripts, CI command blocks, deployment scripts.
- `references/profiles/smart-contracts.md`: Solidity/Solana/on-chain protocol code.
- `references/profiles/data-formats.md`: CSV/JSON/YAML/binary ingestion/export/parsing.
- `references/profiles/naming.md`: naming/intent clarity (after correctness and security pass).

Load only profiles relevant to touched files. Prefer no more than three domain profiles per pass unless the user requests a deep audit.

## Severity Model

- **CRITICAL**: exploitable security flaw, data loss path, or outage risk on critical paths.
- **HIGH**: logic defect or performance failure that can break core behavior.
- **MEDIUM**: maintainability/reliability issue likely to cause near-term defects.
- **LOW**: localized clarity/style/documentation improvements.

## Evidence Rules

- Never fabricate line numbers.
- Tie each finding to concrete code evidence.
- Explain blast radius and failure mode succinctly.
- Prefer targeted fixes over broad rewrites.

## Verification

Run the narrowest checks that validate touched behavior:

- formatter/lint on touched files,
- targeted tests for impacted modules,
- typecheck when relevant.

If checks cannot run, state exactly what was skipped and why.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask for direction when:

- fixes require API/contract redesign,
- behavior intent is too ambiguous to classify severity,
- required validation tooling is unavailable and risk is high.
