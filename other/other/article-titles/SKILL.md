# Article & Blog Titles

Write titles for published articles - deep dives, hub pages, blog posts.

**Core Philosophy:** 80% of content performance comes from the title. Generate volume (10+ options), then select best using proven criteria.

---

## The 3-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Identify Core Value

**What transformation does this article promise?**
- Problem: What pain/struggle does the reader face?
- Goal: What result do they want?
- Path: How does this article move them forward?

**Extract headline elements:**
1. Problem - What pain exists?
2. Goal - What result does reader want?
3. Benefit - What will their life look like after?
4. Concept - What idea/principle applies?
5. Example - What story/data illustrates this?
6. Process - What steps lead to the result?

### Phase 2: Generate 10+ Options

Use multiple formulas from `references/headline-formulas-library.md`:
- Try 3-4 different headline types
- Apply sticky techniques from `references/sticky-sentence-techniques.md`
- Test different element combinations

### Phase 3: Evaluate & Select

Apply `references/10-commandments-checklist.md`:
- Score top 5-7 options
- Aim for 4-6 commandments per title
- Use 4 U's test (Useful, Urgent, Unique, Ultra-specific)
- Select highest scorer that fits the content

## Core Patterns (With Examples)

### 1. Definitive Guide
Authority positioning for comprehensive content.

- "The Complete Guide to Homeschooling in Utah"
- "Everything You Need to Know About ESAs"
- "Microschools: A Parent's Complete Guide"

### 2. How-To + Outcome
Practical promise with clear benefit.

- "How to Start a Microschool (With No Teaching Background)"
- "How to Use Your ESA Without Losing Money"
- "How to Find the Right Curriculum in 3 Steps"

### 3. List + Specific Promise
Number creates scannability and completeness.

- "7 Curriculum Options That Actually Work for ADHD Kids"
- "5 Questions to Ask Before Joining a Microschool"
- "12 Homeschool Co-ops in the Salt Lake Area (2026)"

### 4. Problem + Solution Frame
Names the pain, promises relief.

- "Feeling Overwhelmed by Curriculum Choices? Here's a Framework"
- "When Traditional School Isn't Working: 4 Alternative Paths"
- "ESA Spending Anxiety: What You Can (and Can't) Use It For"

### 5. Contrarian / Myth-Busting
Challenges common belief.

- "Why Homeschool 'Socialization' Fears Are Backwards"
- "The Case Against Grade Levels"
- "Microschools Don't Need Certified Teachers. Here's Why."

### 6. Comparison / Versus
Helps readers make decisions.

- "Classical vs. Charlotte Mason: Which Fits Your Family?"
- "Homeschool vs. Microschool: The Real Differences"
- "Online School vs. Self-Directed Learning: Pros and Cons"

## SEO Considerations

For hub pages and deep dives that need to rank:

**Include primary keyword** near the start when possible:
- "ESA Spending Guide: What You Can Buy in [State]"
- "Microschools Near Me: How to Find One in Your Area"

**Match search intent:**
- Informational: "What is..." "How to..." "Guide to..."
- Comparison: "X vs Y" "Best [category] for [use case]"
- Local: Include state/city for geo-targeted content

**Keep under 60 characters** if SEO matters (Google truncates longer)

## Workflow

1. **What's the core question this answers?** - That's often the title
2. **Match to pattern** - Definitive? How-to? List? Versus?
3. **Generate 5-10 options** - Try different framings
4. **SEO check** - Does primary keyword appear? Under 60 chars if ranking matters?
5. **Select best** - Would you click this in search results?

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Don't:**
- Write vague titles ("Thoughts on Education")
- Use insider jargon without explanation
- Promise more than the article delivers
- Bury the value proposition
- Use clickbait that destroys trust
- Stop at 2-3 options (generate 10+)
- Use hedge words ("might," "could," "possibly")
- Write generic promises ("Boost productivity" vs "Double output in 30 days")

---

## Sticky Techniques (For Memorable Titles)

From `references/sticky-sentence-techniques.md`:

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Alliteration** | "Specificity is the secret" |
| **Symmetry** | "School measures time. Education measures learning." |
| **Contrast** | "Small schools. Big difference." |
| **Rhythm** | Two short parallel phrases that feel balanced |

**Best for titles:** Alliteration, Contrast, Rhythm

## Quick Quality Check

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] **4 U's:** Useful? Urgent? Unique? Ultra-specific? (3/4 minimum)
- [ ] **Primary keyword** near start (for SEO)
- [ ] **Under 60 characters** (if ranking matters)
- [ ] **Would you click this** in search results? (honest answer)
- [ ] **No AI-isms:** delve, comprehensive, leverage, landscape
