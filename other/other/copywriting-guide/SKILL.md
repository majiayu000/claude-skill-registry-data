### Phase 2: Headlines Using Proven Frameworks

**Goal**: Write headlines that grab attention and communicate value

### Framework 1: PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solve)

**Structure**:
1. **Problem**: State the painful problem
2. **Agitate**: Make it worse (emotional impact)
3. **Solve**: Present your solution

**Examples**:
```markdown
❌ "Advanced Project Management Software"

✅ "Drowning in scattered tasks and missed deadlines? (Problem)
    Watching projects spiral while your team stays confused? (Agitate)
    Get everyone aligned with one simple dashboard." (Solve)
```

**Template**:
- "[Problem question?] [Consequence of problem]. [Your solution]."
- "Stop [problem]. Start [benefit]."
- "[Problem], meet [solution name]"

### Framework 2: AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

**Structure**:
1. **Attention**: Hook with surprising statement or question
2. **Interest**: Build curiosity with specific detail
3. **Desire**: Create want with outcome/benefit
4. **Action**: Tell them what to do

**Examples**:
```markdown
Headline (Attention): "10,000 leads per month. On autopilot."
Subhead (Interest): "AI finds your ideal customers while you sleep"
Body (Desire): "Wake up to qualified leads who actually want to buy"
CTA (Action): "Start generating leads today"
```

**Template**:
- Attention: "[Shocking stat or bold claim]"
- Interest: "[How it works in 5 words]"
- Desire: "[Specific outcome they want]"
- Action: "[Simple, clear CTA]"

---

### Framework 3: BAB (Before-After-Bridge)

**Structure**:
1. **Before**: Paint picture of current pain
2. **After**: Show the transformation
3. **Bridge**: Explain how you get them there

**Examples**:
```markdown
Before: "Spending 10 hours a week on manual data entry?"
After:  "Imagine having those 10 hours back for strategic work."
Bridge: "Our AI handles the busywork so you don't have to."
```

**Template**:

### Phase 3: Benefit-Driven Feature Copy

**Goal**: Transform features into customer benefits

**Feature vs Benefit:**

| ❌ Feature-First | ✅ Benefit-First |
|------------------|------------------|
| "Real-time collaboration" | "See changes instantly - no more version conflicts" |
| "256-bit encryption" | "Your data stays private, even from us" |
| "Automated workflows" | "Stop doing repetitive tasks - focus on what matters" |
| "Mobile app" | "Check critical updates from anywhere, anytime" |
| "AI-powered" | "Get instant answers - no more digging through docs" |

**Formula: Feature → Benefit**:
1. State the feature
2. Say "which means..."
3. Describe the outcome/feeling

**Example Process**:
- Feature: "Unlimited projects"
- Which means: You never hit a wall or pay extra
- Benefit: "Create unlimited projects - grow without limits or surprise fees"

---

### Phase 4: Microcopy Patterns

**Goal**: Write small but critical copy throughout the UI

### Button Labels

```markdown
❌ Generic CTAs:
- Submit
- Click Here
- Continue
- OK

✅ Value-Driven CTAs:
- Start Free Trial - No Credit Card
- Get My Custom Quote
- See Pricing & Plans
- Download the Guide
- Send Me the Playbook
- Yes, Send Me Tips
```

**Formula**: [Action Verb] + [What They Get] + [Friction Reducer]
- "Start Free Trial" (action) "- No Credit Card" (friction reducer)
- "Download Guide" (action) "- Takes 2 Minutes" (friction reducer)

### Form Labels

```markdown
❌ Vague labels:
- "Information"
- "Details"
- "Company"

✅ Clear, helpful labels:
- "Email address (we'll never spam you)"
- "Company name (so we can personalize your experience)"
- "Phone number (optional - only for urgent issues)"
```

### Error Messages

```markdown
❌ Unhelpful errors:
- "Error 422"
- "Invalid input"
- "Something went wrong"

✅ Helpful errors:
- "That email address doesn't look right. Did you mean @gmail.com?"
- "Password must be at least 8 characters and include a number"
- "We couldn't process your payment. Please check your card details."
```

**Formula**: [What went wrong] + [Why] + [How to fix]

### Empty States

```markdown
❌ Sad empty states:
- "No data"
- "Nothing here yet"

✅ Motivating empty states:
- "Create your first project to get started"
- "No messages yet - your inbox is zen 🧘"
- "Your tasks list is empty - time to plan your next move"
```

**Formula**: [Current state] + [Encouraging CTA or benefit]

### Loading States

```markdown
❌ Generic loading:
- "Loading..."
- "Please wait"

✅ Specific loading:
- "Analyzing your data..."
- "Generating your report..."
- "Finding the perfect match..."
```

### Success Messages

```markdown
❌ Bland success:
- "Saved"
- "Success"

✅ Celebratory success:
- "Changes saved! You're all set."
- "Welcome aboard! Let's get you set up."
- "Profile updated - looking good!"
```

### Tooltips

```markdown
❌ Redundant tooltips:
- Button: "Save" / Tooltip: "Click to save"

✅ Helpful tooltips:
- Button: "Share" / Tooltip: "Anyone with the link can view"
- Button: "Archive" / Tooltip: "Hide without deleting - you can restore later"
```

### Phase 5: Power Words by Emotion

**Goal**: Use words that trigger psychological responses

### Urgency Words
```
Now, Today, Instant, Immediately, Hurry, Limited, Exclusive, Deadline,
Last Chance, Final Hours, Running Out, While Supplies Last, Act Fast
```

**Usage**: "Start your free trial now - limited spots available"

### Trust Words
```
Proven, Guaranteed, Certified, Verified, Tested, Official, Authentic,
Secure, Protected, Safe, Backed, Endorsed, Trusted
```

**Usage**: "Join 10,000+ verified professionals"

### Curiosity Words
```
Secret, Hidden, Revealed, Discover, Unlock, Insider, Forbidden, Little-Known,
Confidential, Behind the Scenes, Untold, Surprising
```

**Usage**: "Discover the hidden strategy top marketers use"

### Exclusivity Words
```
VIP, Members-Only, Private, Exclusive, Select, Elite, Premium, Invite-Only,
Limited Access, Insider, Special
```

**Usage**: "Get exclusive access to our private community"

### Value Words

## Notes

- Read copy out loud - if it sounds awkward, rewrite it
- Use Hemingway app to check readability (aim for grade 8 or lower)
- Test headlines with real users when possible
- Benefits answer "what's in it for me?" - features don't
- One idea per sentence, one topic per paragraph
- Microcopy is often overlooked but hugely impacts UX
- Avoid superlatives without proof ("best", "fastest" need data)
