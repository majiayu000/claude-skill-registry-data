# Synthesis Engine

*Part of the GONAD: Gremlin Obnoxious Network of Actual Discovery*

## Purpose

Transform intellectual chaos into emergent insight through structured diffusion across domain boundaries.

The core insight: **Patterns that appear in multiple unrelated domains are more likely to be fundamental.** Cross-domain synthesis isn't just finding analogies — it's triangulating toward deeper structure.

---

## The Synthesis Process

### 1. INTAKE: Map the Noise

For each input source:

```
SOURCE: [identifier]
DOMAIN: [field/discipline]
CORE_CLAIM: [one sentence]
MORPHEMES: [irreducible units — see reasoning-patterns Phase 1]
ANOMALIES: [what doesn't fit its own framework]
```

Do not interpret yet. Just map. Interpretation is premature compression.

### 2. SUSPEND: Hold in Superposition

Resist the urge to synthesize immediately. Instead:

- List apparent contradictions between sources
- Note vocabulary that means different things in different domains
- Identify concepts with no equivalent across sources

**The goal is to feel the tension.** If everything seems compatible immediately, you're pattern-matching superficially.

### 3. DIFFUSE: Iterative Cross-Pollination

Apply each source's morphemes to every other source's domain. Ask:

> "If [morpheme from A] were operative in [domain B], what would that imply?"

This generates candidate connections. Most will be noise. That's the point.

**Iteration protocol:**
1. Generate candidates freely (divergence)
2. Filter by: Does this candidate predict something in domain B that wasn't in source A?
3. Surviving candidates get tested against domain C
4. What survives three domains is probably real

### 4. CONVERGE: Fixed-Point Detection

Monitor for convergence signals:

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Same conclusion from different domains | Strong convergence — record it |
| Oscillation between two framings | False dichotomy — find the frame that contains both |
| Everything fitting too smoothly | Confabulation risk — apply ego-check |
| One domain resisting integration | That domain contains the key distinction — investigate |

**Fixed point reached when:** Further iteration produces the same core insight.

### 5. CRYSTALLIZE: Output the Synthesis

Structure the synthesis as:

```
CONVERGENT INSIGHT: [the pattern that survived all domains]
EVIDENCE PER DOMAIN: [how each domain manifests this pattern]
PREDICTIONS: [what the synthesis implies that wasn't in any single source]
TENSIONS: [what remains unresolved]
CONFIDENCE: [calibrated, rarely above 50% for novel synthesis]
```

---

## The Isomorphism Registry

When synthesis produces a cross-domain correspondence, record it:

```
ISOMORPHISM: [name]
DOMAIN A: [pattern in A]
DOMAIN B: [pattern in B]
MAPPING: [how they correspond]
BREAKS: [where the isomorphism fails]
PREDICTIVE: [what it predicts in a third domain]
```

Store in `references/discovered-isomorphisms.md` for future synthesis work.

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | Role in Synthesis |
|-------|-------------------|
| reasoning-patterns | Dokkado Phase 1-2 are intake tools |
| diffusion-reasoning | Provides convergence detection |
| ego-check | Prevents confident confabulation |
| resonant-opposition | Maintains productive tension |
| nexus-mind | Stores discovered isomorphisms |

**Typical flow:**
1. Intake with Dokkado Ground Law
2. Diffuse with reasoning-diffusion dynamics
3. Validate with ego-check
4. Store with nexus-mind

## Common Failure Modes

### Surface Mapping
*Symptom:* Two things share a word, treated as equivalent.
*Fix:* Ask: "Does the isomorphism predict anything new?"

### Forced Fit
*Symptom:* Domain B contorted to match Domain A.
*Fix:* Investigate where B resists — that's where the real distinction lives.

### Premature Crystallization
*Symptom:* Synthesis feels complete but predictions don't pan out.
*Fix:* Return to SUSPEND phase with new constraints.

### Convergence Theater
*Symptom:* Declaring convergence because it would be elegant if true.
*Fix:* Apply ego-check Question 3: "Am I saying this because it's true or because it feels good?"

## Quick Reference

```
SYNTHESIS PROTOCOL

1. INTAKE     → Map each source's morphemes without interpretation
2. SUSPEND    → Hold contradictions in tension, resist premature synthesis
3. DIFFUSE    → Cross-pollinate morphemes across domains iteratively
4. CONVERGE   → Detect fixed points through multi-domain survival
5. CRYSTALLIZE → Output insight with predictions and calibrated confidence

KEY PRINCIPLE: Patterns that survive translation across unrelated domains
               are more likely to reflect deep structure than surface analogy.

WATCHWORD: Integration without reduction.
