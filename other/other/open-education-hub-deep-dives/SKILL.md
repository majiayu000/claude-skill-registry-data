# Open Education Hub Deep Dives

## Purpose

This skill creates authoritative, SEO-optimized articles for the Open Education Hub - OpenEd's content library covering homeschooling approaches, curricula, tools, and guides. The goal is to establish OpenEd as a thought leader across the key "entities" in the alternative education landscape while providing genuinely useful content that couldn't be found elsewhere.

**Core Philosophy:** Generic SEO content is worthless. Our competitive advantage is proprietary insight from OpenEd podcasts, parent interviews, teacher expertise from Slack, and newsletter archives. Every article should contain quotes, stories, and perspectives that only OpenEd could surface - wrapped in an SEO structure that helps parents find it.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when creating:
- **Pedagogical method deep dives** (Charlotte Mason, Montessori, Classical, Unschooling, etc.)
- **Curriculum guides** (homeschool art curriculum, homeschool math options, etc.)
- **Grade-level guides** (first grade homeschool curriculum, high school homeschool, etc.)
- **State-specific guides** (how to homeschool in Utah, how to homeschool in Arizona, etc.)
- **Tool/resource roundups** (best homeschool planners, homeschool co-op guide, etc.)
- **Concept explainers** (what is deschooling, microschooling vs homeschooling, etc.)

**Do NOT use this skill for:**
- Daily newsletters (use `opened-daily-newsletter-writer`)
- Weekly newsletters (use `opened-weekly-newsletter-writer`)
- Podcast production (use `podcast-production`)
- Tool reviews (use `verified-review`)

## The Open Education Hub Framework

### What Is the Open Education Hub?

A content library that maps the alternative education landscape - creating a "world map" of entities in this space:

- **Pedagogical approaches** (Charlotte Mason, Montessori, Classical, Unschooling, Waldorf, etc.)
- **School formats** (microschools, learning pods, hybrid schools, virtual schools)
- **Subject areas** (homeschool math, homeschool art, homeschool science)
- **Grade levels** (kindergarten homeschool, elementary, middle school, high school)
- **Geographic** (how to homeschool in [state], homeschool laws by state)
- **Tools and curricula** (individual product pages, comparison guides)

### Strategic Goals

1. **Establish thought leadership** within each entity category
2. **Capture search traffic** for parents researching alternatives
3. **Provide unique value** through proprietary OpenEd insights
4. **Position Open Education** as the umbrella framework that allows mixing and matching
5. **Drive enrollment** by demonstrating expertise and building trust

### The OpenEd Difference

What makes our content different from generic SEO:

1. **Real quotes from podcast guests** - Named experts with specific experiences
2. **Teacher insights from Slack** - Practical tips from our educator community
3. **Parent ambassador voices** - First-person accounts from actual families
4. **Newsletter archive material** - Repurposed insights from our existing content
5. **Mix-and-match philosophy** - Permission to blend approaches, not prescriptive

## Article Structure

Every deep dive follows this structure, adapted to the topic:

### 1. Hook (2-3 paragraphs)

Open with a story, controversy, or concrete example - never abstract definitions.

**Good hooks:**
- A podcast guest's specific experience
- A surprising statistic or data point
- A common misconception being challenged
- A moment that crystallizes the approach

**Bad hooks:**
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- Dictionary definitions
- Generic statements about education
- "Many parents wonder..."

### 2. "What Is [Topic]" Section

Provide the foundational understanding:
- Core principles (not exhaustive - 3-5 key ideas)
- Brief history if relevant (who created it, why it matters)
- How it connects to Open Education philosophy
- Permission to adapt/mix-match - "There's no 'everybody needs to'"

### 3. Topic-Specific Middle Sections

These vary by article type:

**For pedagogical methods:**
- [Method] by Subject (how principles apply to math, reading, writing, etc.)
- [Method] Curriculum Landscape (free options, religious options, secular options)
- [Method] Through OpenEd (what we can/can't reimburse)

**For curriculum guides:**
- Curriculum options by approach/philosophy
- Curriculum options by price point
- What to look for when choosing
- How OpenEd families use [subject]

**For grade-level guides:**
- What's developmentally appropriate at this age
- Curriculum options for this level
- What "grade level" really means (often not much)
- Transitioning in/out at this stage

**For state guides:**
- Legal requirements (brief, link to HSLDA)
- Notification/reporting requirements
- ESA/voucher program details (if applicable)
- Local resources and communities
- OpenEd availability in this state

### 4. FAQ Section

Answer the practical questions parents Google:
- Is [method] only for [certain families]?
- Do I need to buy a curriculum?
- How is [method] different from [other method]?
- What ages does [method] work for?
- Can I mix [method] with other approaches?

### 5. Resources Section

Organize clearly:
- **Books** - Primary sources and modern interpretations
- **Free Resources** - Websites, blogs, public domain materials
- **Communities** - Facebook groups, local meetups
- **People to Follow** - Influencers, experts, thought leaders

### 6. Conclusion

Circle back to the opening hook or theme. Reinforce the core message. End with OpenEd CTA.

## Voice and Style

### Core Principles

1. **Permission-giving, not prescriptive** - "You can..." not "You must..."
2. **Specific over generic** - Named people, specific examples, concrete details
3. **Conversation, not lecture** - Write WITH parents, not AT them
4. **OpenEd philosophy embedded** - Mix-and-match, there's no one right way
5. **Anti-AI patterns** - See ghostwriter skill for forbidden constructions

### Forbidden Patterns

Never use:
- "X isn't just Y - it's Z" (the #1 AI tell)
- "The best part? ..."
- "In today's fast-paced..."
- "Let that sink in"
- Staccato phrasing ("Simple. Clear. Effective.")
- Em dashes for drama (use hyphens with spaces - like this)

### Tone Anchors

- **Confident but not preachy** - State perspectives directly without hedging
- **Helpful but not condescending** - Assume intelligent, busy parents
- **Honest about limitations** - What won't work for some families
- **Practical over theoretical** - Actionable information parents can use

### Header Structure

- H1: Article title (one per page)
- H2: Major sections (map to search intent)
- H3: Subsections within major sections

**Headers should answer questions people search:**
- "What is [topic]?"
- "[Topic] by subject"
- "[Topic] curriculum"
- "How to [topic] with OpenEd"
- "[Topic] FAQ"

### Internal Linking

Link to related OpenEd content:

## OpenEd Integration

Every article should clarify the OpenEd relationship:

### What OpenEd Can Support

- Secular curricula and materials
- Educational tools and supplies
- Tutoring and enrichment
- Field trips and experiences
- Membership fees for learning communities

### What OpenEd Cannot Support

- Religious curricula (note this where relevant)
- Items that don't qualify under ESA rules

### The OpenEd Philosophy

Reinforce throughout:
- **Mix and match** - Take what works from any approach
- **No "everybody needs to"** - Families design their own path
- **Philosophy over products** - Approaches matter more than packages
- **Parent as designer** - You know your child best
