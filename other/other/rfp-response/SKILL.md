## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Analyzes requirements | Bid/no-bid decision |
| Creates compliance matrix | Pricing strategy |
| Structures sections | Resource allocation |
| Drafts content | Win themes priority |
| Identifies gaps | Go/no-go approval |

## Instructions

### Step 1: RFP Analysis

**Initial Assessment:**
| Element | What to Extract |
|---------|-----------------|
| Issuer | Organization, contact |
| Due Date | Submission deadline |
| Budget | Stated or estimated |
| Scope | Core requirements |
| Evaluation | Criteria and weights |
| Format | Page limits, structure |

**Bid/No-Bid Factors:**
| Factor | Score 1-5 |
|--------|-----------|
| Solution fit |  |
| Relationship strength |  |
| Competitive position |  |
| Resource availability |  |
| Strategic value |  |
| Win probability |  |

### Step 2: Compliance Matrix

**Requirement Tracking:**
| Req # | Requirement | Response Section | Status | Owner |
|-------|-------------|------------------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 | Description | 3.2 | Draft | Name |
| 1.2 | Description | 3.3 | Review | Name |

**Compliance Levels:**
- Compliant (C) - Fully meets requirement
- Partial (P) - Meets with explanation
- Non-Compliant (NC) - Does not meet
- Exception (E) - Propose alternative

### Step 3: Win Theme Development

**Theme Framework:**
| Theme | Evidence | Differentiator | Evaluator Benefit |
|-------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Theme 1 | Proof point | Why unique | What they gain |

**Theme Formula:**
```
[Feature] + [Evidence] = [Benefit to Evaluator]

Example: "Our dedicated success team (feature) +
         98% retention rate (evidence) =
         lower risk of implementation failure (benefit)"
```

### Step 4: Section Writing

**Structure per Section:**
1. **Theme statement** (opening sentence)
2. **Understanding** (their need)
3. **Approach** (your solution)
4. **Evidence** (proof it works)
5. **Benefit** (why it matters to them)

**Ghost Competitors:**
- Address competitor weaknesses indirectly
- Never name competitors
- Position your strength against their weakness

### Step 5: Executive Summary

**Executive Summary Formula:**
| Section | Length | Content |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Hook | 1-2 sentences | Their biggest challenge |
| Understanding | 1 paragraph | Prove you get it |
| Solution | 1-2 paragraphs | Your approach |
| Why Us | 1 paragraph | Differentiation |
| CTA | 1-2 sentences | Clear next step |

### Executive Summary (Draft)

---

**THE CHALLENGE**

Springfield's 200,000 citizens deserve modern, responsive government services. Your current system, built 15 years ago, creates delays and frustration for both citizens and staff.

**OUR UNDERSTANDING**

Springfield needs more than a CRM upgrade—you need a citizen experience transformation. Based on our analysis of your RFP and conversations with your team, your priorities are:

1. Reducing citizen wait times from 10+ minutes to under 2
2. Enabling true omnichannel service (phone, web, mobile, in-person)
3. Providing leadership with real-time visibility into service delivery
4. Ensuring full ADA and accessibility compliance

**OUR SOLUTION**

CivicConnect, our purpose-built municipal CRM, addresses these exact needs. Unlike generic CRMs adapted for government, CivicConnect was designed from day one for citizen services.

Key capabilities:
- **Unified citizen profile** across all channels
- **AI-assisted routing** reducing resolution time by 40%
- **Real-time dashboards** built for elected officials and department heads
- **Native accessibility** exceeding WCAG 2.1 AA standards

**WHY [COMPANY]**

With 47 successful municipal deployments, including [Similar City] and [Another City], we understand government's unique requirements. Our 94% on-schedule delivery rate and 98% client retention demonstrate our commitment to partnership, not just projects.

**NEXT STEPS**

We propose a discovery workshop with your team to validate requirements and refine the implementation approach. This investment in upfront alignment is how we achieve our 94% on-time rate.

### Section 4.1: Multi-Channel Citizen Intake (Draft)

---

**CivicConnect's unified intake system transforms how Springfield citizens access services.**

Understanding the Need: Springfield citizens currently experience fragmented service—phone callers repeat information to multiple departments, online submissions disappear into queues, and walk-in visitors wait while staff search for context. This frustration is avoidable.

Our Approach: CivicConnect provides true omnichannel intake with a single citizen record:

| Channel | Capability | Citizen Benefit |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Phone | CTI integration, screen pop | Staff see full history instantly |
| Web | Smart forms, auto-routing | Right department first time |
| Mobile | GPS-enabled reporting | Location auto-populated |
| In-Person | Queue management, kiosk | Reduced wait times |
| Email | NLP categorization | Faster routing |

Evidence: When [Similar City] implemented this approach, they saw:
- 62% reduction in repeat contacts
- 3.2-minute average resolution (from 10.4 minutes)
- 89% citizen satisfaction (from 67%)

Benefit to Springfield: Citizens get answers faster, staff spend time solving problems rather than gathering information, and leadership sees exactly where bottlenecks occur.

### Evaluation Strategy

| Criteria | Weight | Our Strength | Strategy |
|----------|--------|--------------|----------|
| Technical | 40% | Strong | Lead with gov-specific features |
| Price | 30% | Competitive | Emphasize TCO, not just license |
| Experience | 20% | Very Strong | Heavy use of case studies |
| References | 10% | Strong | Prep 3 referenceable clients |

**Ghosting Competitors:**
- Generic CRM vendors: Emphasize "purpose-built for government"
- Low-cost options: Focus on "total cost of ownership" and implementation risk
- Larger vendors: Highlight "dedicated government team" and responsiveness
```

### Example 2: Quick Compliance Check

**Input:**
```
Quick compliance check for these requirements:
1. Must support 500 concurrent users
2. 99.9% uptime SLA required
3. Data must remain in US
4. SOC 2 Type II certification
5. Integration with Salesforce
```

**Output:**
```
## Compliance Quick Check

| Req | Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-----|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 500 concurrent users | C | Supports 2,000+ |
| 2 | 99.9% uptime SLA | C | Standard tier includes |
| 3 | US data residency | C | AWS US-East only |
| 4 | SOC 2 Type II | C | Current certification |
| 5 | Salesforce integration | P | Requires middleware |

### Action Required

**Requirement 5 (Salesforce):**
- Status: Partial compliance
- Gap: No native connector
- Solution: MuleSoft integration (additional $15K)
- Response language: "Integration achieved through certified MuleSoft connector, providing real-time bi-directional sync"

### Recommended Response Approach

Full compliance on 4/5 requirements. For #5, lead with capability, mention integration approach, include cost in pricing section. Do not highlight as limitation.
