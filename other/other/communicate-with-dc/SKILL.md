## Who is the Dc?

Dc types are strong-willed, independent, and results-focused with a powerful drive toward achieving goals efficiently and precisely. They combine the assertiveness of D with the analytical precision of C, making them more intense and forceful than most while also being methodical and quality-focused. They prefer to be serious and business-like in their interactions, investing energy in purposeful activities rather than casual socializing. They don't just want results -- they want results done right.

## Do's

- Be very direct, assertive, and business-focused. Stay on topic and orient toward results.
- Come prepared with data and logical reasoning to support your position.
- Work quickly and effectively -- they respect efficiency in others.
- Share your thoughts and logical ideas openly. They value intellectual honesty.
- Keep communication factual and precise. Say exactly what you mean.
- Give them autonomy and the freedom to work independently.
- Be comfortable with their intensity and directness -- don't take it personally.
- Present well-researched arguments and be ready to defend them logically.

## Don'ts

- Don't engage in extensive small talk or social pleasantries before getting to business.
- Don't make emotional appeals or poorly supported arguments. They'll dismiss them immediately.
- Don't require frequent meetings or check-ins when asynchronous communication would suffice.
- Don't deliver criticism in overly gentle, softened ways -- they prefer and respect directness.
- Don't expect frequent verbal encouragement or praise from them. They show respect through trust.
- Don't challenge their authority without solid evidence and reasoning to back it up.
- Don't force them into open-ended brainstorming without clear objectives.
- Don't move on from projects before they're properly completed -- they find that deeply frustrating.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Keep meetings brief and only schedule them when truly necessary. Dc types prefer efficiency over formality. Have a clear agenda, make decisions quickly, and end on time. If a matter can be handled via email, don't call a meeting.

### Email
Write emails that are concise, business-like in tone, and factual in content. Lead with your main point, use bullet points for clarity, and avoid unnecessary pleasantries. Be precise with your language and requests. Every sentence should serve a purpose.

### Giving Feedback
Deliver feedback directly, critically, and focused on results. Dc types can handle straightforward criticism and prefer it to softened messages. Focus on specific improvements and tie feedback to outcomes and quality standards.

### Resolving Conflict
Address conflicts in a straightforward, logical way. Dc types prefer tackling issues head-on with facts and data. Focus on solutions and outcomes rather than emotions, and be prepared to defend your position logically. They respect people who don't back down from well-reasoned arguments.
