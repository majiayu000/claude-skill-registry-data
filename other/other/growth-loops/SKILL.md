## Methodology Foundation

**Sources:**
- Brian Balfour - "Growth Loops are the New Funnels" (Reforge)
- Reforge Growth Series curriculum
- Kevin Kwok - "The Arc of Collaboration"

**Core Principle:** Growth loops are closed systems where outputs from one cycle become inputs for the next, creating compounding effects over time. Unlike funnels, loops don't require constant external input to maintain output.

> "Loops are closed systems where the inputs through some process generates more of an output that can be reinvested in the input." — Brian Balfour

## Instructions

### Understanding the Paradigm Shift

#### The Funnel Problem

Traditional growth thinking:
```
Awareness → Interest → Consideration → Purchase → (end)
     ↓          ↓           ↓            ↓
   Drop      Drop        Drop         Drop
```

**Why funnels plateau:**
- Require constant new input to maintain output
- No compounding effect
- Channels commoditize (CAC rises over time)
- Easily replicated by competitors

#### The Loop Solution

Growth loop thinking:
```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                     │
    ▼                                     │
New User → Action → Output → Distribution ─┘
                      │
                      └─→ (Attracts more new users)
```

**Why loops compound:**
- Output becomes input for next cycle
- Growth accelerates over time
- Creates defensible competitive advantage
- Can decrease CAC as loop strengthens

---

### The Four Types of Growth Loops

#### Type 1: Viral/Referral Loops

**Mechanism:** Users invite other users who invite more users.

```
New User → Experiences Value → Invites Others → New Users Sign Up → Repeat
```

**Best for:**
- Collaboration tools (Slack, Zoom, Notion)
- Social products (Facebook, TikTok)
- Products with network effects
- Consumer apps with sharing incentive

**Key metrics:**
| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Viral coefficient (K) | Invites × Conversion rate | >1 for viral growth |
| Cycle time | Days per loop iteration | Shorter = faster |
| Invitation rate | % of users who invite | Higher = more fuel |

**Optimization levers:**
- Reduce friction in invitation process
- Increase invitation incentive (both sides)
- Shorten time to value (faster "aha" moment)
- Improve targeting (invite right people)
- Make sharing natural to product use

---

#### Type 2: User-Generated Content (UGC) Loops

**Mechanism:** Users create content that attracts new users who create more content.

```
User Creates Content → Content Indexed/Distributed → New Users Discover → Sign Up → Create Content → Repeat
```

**Best for:**
- Professional networks (LinkedIn)
- Review platforms (Yelp, G2)
- Community platforms (Reddit, Pinterest)
- Marketplaces (Airbnb, Etsy)

**Key metrics:**
| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Content creation rate | % of users creating | Higher = more SEO fuel |
| Content discoverability | Organic traffic per piece | Optimize for search |
| Content-to-signup CVR | Visitors → signups | Higher = tighter loop |
| Creator activation | New users → creators | Faster = more content |

**Optimization levers:**
- Lower content creation friction
- Improve content templates/prompts
- Optimize content for SEO/feeds
- Incentivize quality content
- Distribute across more channels

---

#### Type 3: Paid Marketing Loops

**Mechanism:** Revenue funds acquisition of customers who generate more revenue.

```
Ad Spend → Customer Acquisition → Revenue Generation → Reinvest in Ads → Repeat
```

**Best for:**
- E-commerce with strong margins
- SaaS with fast payback periods
- Products with high LTV
- Transactional businesses

**Key metrics:**
| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| LTV:CAC ratio | Customer lifetime value ÷ acquisition cost | >3:1 ideal |
| Payback period | Months to recover CAC | <12 months |
| Marginal efficiency | Additional spend efficiency | Stable or improving |

**Requirements for loop to work:**
- LTV > CAC (profit to reinvest)
- Sustainable payback period
- Capital available for investment
- Marginal efficiency doesn't collapse

**Optimization levers:**
- Increase LTV (retention, expansion revenue)
- Decrease CAC (creative, targeting, conversion)
- Shorten payback (pricing, onboarding)
- Improve capital efficiency

---

#### Type 4: Sales Loops

**Mechanism:** Customer success creates reference customers that help close more deals.

```
Close Deal → Customer Success → Case Study/Reference → Credibility → Close More Deals → Repeat
```

**Best for:**
- Enterprise SaaS
- High-ticket B2B services
- Consultancies and agencies
- Complex sale products

**Key metrics:**
| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Time to success | Days from close to ROI | Shorter = faster reference |
| Reference rate | % of customers becoming references | Higher = more ammo |
| Win rate with reference | Close rate with case study | Track improvement |
| Deal cycle with reference | Sales cycle length | Shorter = acceleration |

**Optimization levers:**
- Accelerate customer onboarding
- Define and measure success clearly
- Systematize case study production
- Train sales on storytelling
- Segment by successful customer profile

---

### Why Retention Powers Every Loop

> "Retention is the foundation of growth." — Brian Balfour

**Without retention, loops break:**

| Loop Type | Retention Impact |
|-----------|------------------|
| Viral | Churned users stop inviting |
| UGC | Churned users stop creating content |
| Paid | Poor retention = poor LTV = negative unit economics |
| Sales | Churned customers can't be references |

**Retention amplifies loops:**
- Retained users make more invitations over time
- Retained users create more content
- Retained users have higher LTV
- Retained customers become better references

**Before optimizing any loop, ensure:**
- Week 1 retention > 40%
- Month 1 retention > 25%
- Core action repeated regularly
- Users reaching "aha" moment

---

### Designing Your Growth Loop

#### Step 1: Identify Your Value Action

What single action, when taken by users, creates the most value?

| Product Type | Value Action |
|--------------|--------------|
| Collaboration tool | Complete task with teammate |
| Social network | Post or connect |
| Marketplace | Complete transaction |
| SaaS tool | Use core feature successfully |
| Content platform | Create or consume content |

#### Step 2: Find the Byproduct

What does the value action naturally produce that could attract new users?

| Value Action | Byproduct |
|--------------|-----------|
| Send meeting invite | Recipient sees product |
| Create profile | Profile ranks in search |
| Leave review | Review attracts searchers |
| Share file | Recipient needs account |
| Achieve success | Story worth telling |

#### Step 3: Map the Complete Loop

```
INPUT: What triggers the loop?
       └─→ ACTION: What does the user do?
                  └─→ OUTPUT: What does the action create?
                             └─→ DISTRIBUTION: How do new users discover?
                                              └─→ CONVERSION: How do they become input?
                                                             └─→ [Back to INPUT]
```

#### Step 4: Measure Each Step

For each step, define:
- **Volume**: How many users/actions?
- **Conversion**: What % proceed to next step?
- **Velocity**: How quickly does it happen?

#### Step 5: Find the Constraint

The slowest or leakiest step determines loop speed.

Questions to ask:
- Where do we lose the most volume?
- Where does the loop take the longest?
- What step has the lowest conversion?
- What assumption are we making that might be wrong?

---

### Loop Optimization Framework

#### The Loop Velocity Equation

```
Loop Velocity = Volume × Efficiency × Frequency
```

- **Volume**: How many users enter the loop
- **Efficiency**: What % complete the full loop
- **Frequency**: How often the loop cycles

**To accelerate growth, improve any factor:**

| Factor | Optimization Approach |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Volume | Expand top of loop (more channels, wider targeting) |
| Efficiency | Fix leaky steps (reduce friction, improve conversion) |
| Frequency | Shorten cycle time (faster activation, quicker output) |

#### Prioritization Matrix

| Improvement | Effort | Impact | Priority |
|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Fix biggest leak | Medium | High | 1 |
| Shorten cycle time | Low | High | 2 |
| Add volume source | High | Medium | 3 |
| New loop type | Very High | Very High | 4 |

---

### Building Multiple Loops

Best-in-class companies run multiple interconnected loops:

**LinkedIn Example:**

1. **Profile SEO Loop** (UGC)
   - Create profile → Rank in Google → Sign up → Create profile

2. **Connection Viral Loop**
   - Connect → Invitations → Sign up → Connect

3. **Content Feed Loop** (UGC)
   - Post → Feed distribution → Engagement → More posting

4. **Job Posting Loop** (Paid/UGC hybrid)
   - Post job → Candidates apply → Value → More jobs posted

**Key insight:** Loops can feed each other:
- Profile loop brings users who create content
- Content loop increases engagement for profile loop
- Job loop monetizes while reinforcing value

---

### Growth Loop Audit

Use this framework to assess your current state:

#### Audit Questions

1. **What is our primary growth loop today?**
   - Can you draw it as a closed loop?
   - Or is it actually a funnel (linear, no feedback)?

2. **What is our loop velocity?**
   - How long does one cycle take?
   - How many cycles per month?

3. **What is the primary friction point?**
   - Where does the loop break most often?
   - What step has lowest conversion?

4. **What is our retention rate?**
   - Is retention strong enough to power the loop?
   - Where do we lose users before they can fuel the loop?

5. **Are we measuring loop health?**
   - Do we track cycle time?
   - Do we track loop-specific metrics vs. vanity metrics?

6. **Could we add a secondary loop?**
   - What other byproducts could attract users?
   - What adjacent loop types fit our model?

7. **What would 10x our loop velocity?**
   - If we had to accelerate dramatically, what would we change?
   - What bold bets would we make?

## Examples

### Example 1: Designing a Viral Loop for a Project Management Tool

**Context:** B2B project management SaaS with strong retention but growth dependent on paid ads. CAC rising, need sustainable growth channel.

**Analysis:**

**Current State (Funnel):**
```
Google Ads → Landing Page → Trial → Paid
    ↓            ↓           ↓
  70%          65%         75%
  drop         drop        drop
```
- No loop: requires constant ad spend
- CAC: $180, rising 15% annually
- LTV: $540 (3-year average)
- Loop opportunity: product requires team collaboration

**Designed Loop (Viral):**
```
New User Signs Up
       │
       ▼
Creates Project + Invites Team (natural to use product)
       │
       ▼
Teammates Receive Invite (see product value in email)
       │
       ▼
25% Sign Up (free tier, no friction)
       │
       ▼
New Users Create Projects + Invite Their Teams
       │
       └─────────────► [Loop repeats]
```

**Loop Metrics:**
| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Invitation rate | 15% | 40% |
| Invite volume per user | 2 | 5 |
| Invite conversion | 12% | 25% |
| Viral coefficient (K) | 0.04 | 0.5 |
| Cycle time | 14 days | 5 days |

**Optimization Plan:**

1. **Increase invitation rate (15% → 40%)**
   - Move "invite team" to onboarding flow (required step)
   - Add empty state prompts ("This project is lonely...")
   - Create @mention that triggers invitation

2. **Increase invite volume (2 → 5)**
   - Import from Slack/email contacts
   - Suggest teammates based on company domain
   - "Invite all" button for groups

3. **Improve invite conversion (12% → 25%)**
   - Personalize invite email (project name, inviter name)
   - Show preview of project activity in email
   - One-click accept (no form to start)

4. **Shorten cycle time (14 days → 5 days)**
   - Trigger invite prompt after first milestone, not after 7 days
   - Daily digest showing team activity (creates FOMO)

**Projected Impact:**
- K-factor improvement: 0.04 → 0.5
- Reduces dependence on paid by 40%
- CAC drops as organic grows

### Example 2: Building a UGC Loop for a B2B Review Platform

**Context:** Software review site competing with G2 and Capterra. Need more reviews to rank in search, need traffic to get more reviewers. Classic chicken-and-egg.

**Designed Loop:**
```
User Writes Review
       │
       ▼
Review Published (optimized for "[Software] review" keywords)
       │
       ▼
Review Ranks in Google
       │
       ▼
Searcher Finds Review, Visits Site
       │
       ▼
20% Sign Up to Write Their Own Review
       │
       ▼
New User Writes Review
       │
       └─────────────► [Loop repeats]
```

**Loop Metrics:**
| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Monthly reviews created | 500 | 2,000 |
| Reviews ranking page 1 | 5% | 25% |
| Organic traffic | 10K | 100K |
| Traffic → signup CVR | 2% | 5% |
| Signup → review CVR | 10% | 30% |

**Optimization Plan:**

1. **Increase review creation (500 → 2,000)**
   - Review incentive program ($10 gift card)
   - "Review swap" with software vendors
   - LinkedIn outreach to verified users
   - Post-NPS trigger: "Score 9-10? Write a public review"

2. **Improve SEO ranking (5% → 25%)**
   - Structured data for reviews (schema markup)
   - Internal linking strategy (category → product → reviews)
   - Review template that naturally includes keywords
   - Freshness: encourage review updates

3. **Increase traffic → signup (2% → 5%)**
   - "Write your review" CTA on every review page
   - Show "reviewer badges" (status incentive)
   - Personalized prompt: "You use [Software]? Share your experience"

4. **Increase signup → review (10% → 30%)**
   - Pre-fill review with software they indicated using
   - Review wizard (guided questions, not blank page)
   - Progress bar showing completion
   - Instant badge/reward upon submission

**Secondary Loop (Viral):**
```
User Writes Review → Shares on LinkedIn → Colleagues See → Sign Up to Write
```
- Encourage sharing with "Add to LinkedIn profile" feature
- Badge image optimized for social sharing

**Compound Effect:**
- Year 1: 2,000 reviews, 50K organic traffic
- Year 2: 8,000 reviews, 200K organic traffic
- Year 3: 30,000 reviews, 1M organic traffic
- Each review compounds SEO value indefinitely
