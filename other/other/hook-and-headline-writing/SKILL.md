# Hook and Headline Writer

## Purpose

Create hooks and headlines that **stop the scroll and compel action** using systematic frameworks.

**Core Philosophy:** 80% of content performance comes from the hook. Spend 25% of your time crafting it. Generate volume (10+ options), then select best using proven criteria.

## When to Use

- Newsletter subject lines
- Social media thread hooks (X, LinkedIn, Facebook)
- Blog post/article headlines
- A/B testing variations

**Use with:** `daily-newsletter-workflow`, `weekly-newsletter-workflow`, `social-content-creation`

---

## Key Principles

### The 3-Sentence Rule (Social Hooks)
- Maximum 3 sentences
- First sentence MUST be short
- Each sentence's goal: get reader to next

### The 25% Rule
- 25% ideation (what to say)
- 25% hook/headline (how to say it)
- 50% content (the rest)

### Volume → Selection
- Generate 10+ variations minimum
- Select using systematic criteria
- First option is rarely best

### Story = Problem + Goal + Path
This equation equals value. Use it to identify what transformation your hook promises.

## The 3-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Generate Hook Ideas

**Goal:** Identify the core benefit, transformation, or insight

#### Step 1: "Start Questioning" Method

Ask who/what/where/when/why/how about your topic. Dig deeper 2-3 times on promising angles.

**Example:**
- **Topic:** Microschools
- **What?** Small schools with 5-15 students
- **Why?** Personalization, community, flexibility
- **Why (deeper)?** Kids who actually want to learn
- **Impact discovered:** "You don't need permission to start a school"

#### Step 2: Identify the Transformation

**Problem:** What struggle/pain does the audience face?
**Goal:** What result do they want?
**Path:** What's the journey between them?

*Your hook should promise movement along this path.*

#### Step 3: Extract Headline Elements

1. **Problem** - What pain/struggle exists?
2. **Goal** - What result does reader want?
3. **Benefit** - What will their life look like after?
4. **Concept** - What idea/principle applies?
5. **Example** - What story/data illustrates this?
6. **Process** - What steps lead to the result?

#### Step 4: "Become the Reader" Check

- **Ask:** "What's in it for me?"
- **Check:** Is this too abstract?
- **Verify:** Would I stop scrolling for this?

---

### Phase 2: Select Hook Type & Formula

**Goal:** Match your idea to proven frameworks

#### Headline Element Combinations

Combine 2 of the 6 elements:

| Combination | Formula | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Problem + Process** | "How to [Solve Problem] in [Steps]" | "How to Overcome Writer's Block in 5 Steps" |
| **Benefit + Timeframe** | "[Achieve Benefit] in [Time]" | "Double Your Productivity in 30 Days" |
| **Concept + Audience** | "[Concept] for [Specific People]" | "Minimalism for Busy Professionals" |
| **Goal + Benefit** | "[Achieve Goal] to [Get Benefit]" | "Build an Audience to Earn Money While You Sleep" |
| **Example + Process** | "[Specific Result] using [Method]" | "How I Hit 100K Followers Using 3 Simple Rules" |
| **Problem + Benefit** | "Stop [Problem] and Start [Benefit]" | "Stop Trading Time for Money and Start Building Passive Income" |

Try 5-10 combinations, select 2-3 most powerful.

#### Hook Types Quick Reference

| Type | When to Use | Formula Pattern |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Curiosity** | Reveals process/method/insight | State what + why, leave out how |
| **Transformation** | Shows before → after | "[Before State] → [After State]. Here's how:" |
| **Authority** | You have credentials/results | "[Credentials]. Here's what [audience] should know:" |
| **Problem Callout** | Audience has clear pain | "Are you making these [#] mistakes?" |
| **Target Callout** | Niche content for specific segment | "[Audience]... [Action/insight they need]" |
| **Bold Claim** | Contrarian/surprising angle | "[Controversial claim]. Here's why:" |

**Full examples:** `references/hook-types-expanded.md`

#### Apply Sticky Sentence Techniques

Enhance with literary devices:

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Alliteration** | "Specificity is the secret" |
| **Symmetry** | "Read for awareness. Write for understanding." |
| **Contrast** | "To be everywhere is to be nowhere" |
| **Rhyme** | "Tell a story or lose your glory" |
| **Rhythm** | "When you can't wait to share it, they can't help but read it" |

**Combine for maximum stickiness:** "Anger prepares us to fight. Fear prepares us to flee." (Symmetry + Alliteration)

#### Proven Headline Formulas (Quick Reference)

1. **How-to:** "How to [Result] in [Timeframe]"
2. **List:** "[Number] Ways to [Goal]"
3. **Question:** "Are You Making These [#] Mistakes?"
4. **Curiosity-gap:** "The Surprising Truth About [Topic]"
5. **Benefit-driven:** "[Do This] to [Get Benefit]"
6. **Without Formula:** "Do [Great Thing] without [Thing They Hate]"
7. **Quick and Easy:** "A Quick and Easy Way to [Solve Problem]"

### Phase 3: Optimize & Select Best

**Goal:** Generate 10+ variations and select using systematic criteria

#### Step 1: Generate Volume (10+ Variations)

Using different combinations from Phase 2:
- Try 3-4 different hook types
- Apply 2-3 different headline formulas
- Test with/without sticky sentence techniques

**Minimum output:** 10 hook variations

#### Step 2: Apply the 10 Commandments

Optimize top 5-7 variations. Aim for 4-6 commandments per hook:

1. **Numbers/Statistics** - Specific numbers, not "many" or "several"
2. **Negativity Bias** - Potential loss, mistake, consequence
3. **Pattern Interrupt** - Challenge common belief
4. **Target Callout** - Name specific audience
5. **Problem Callout** - Identify pain point immediately
6. **Confidence/Conviction** - Strong language, no hedge words
7. **Aesthetics** - Visually clean, scannable
8. **Potential Benefit** - Clear outcome, not just process
9. **Social Proof** - Authority, results, validation
10. **Warning/Caution** - Urgency or importance

**Full checklist with examples:** `references/10-commandments-checklist.md`

#### Step 3: Test with The 4 U's

Evaluate top 3-5 options:

1. **Useful** - Does it offer clear value?
2. **Urgent** - Does it compel immediate action?
3. **Unique** - Does it stand out?
4. **Ultra-specific** - Is it concrete, not vague?

**Quality threshold:** 3/4 or 4/4

**Example passing all 4:**
"7 Little-Known SEO Tricks to Boost Your Traffic by 204% in Just 30 Days"
- Useful (SEO tricks) ✓ | Urgent (30 days) ✓ | Unique (little-known) ✓ | Ultra-specific (204%, 7 tricks) ✓

#### Step 4: Final Selection (Anatomy Criteria)

Rate each criterion 1-5. Minimum: 20/25.

1. **Clarity** - Main point immediately clear?
2. **Specificity** - Concrete information or promise?
3. **Urgency** - Compels immediate action?
4. **Uniqueness** - Stands out from competitors?
5. **Relevance** - Aligns with target audience?

#### Step 5: "Become the Reader" Final Check

- [ ] "What's in it for me?" - Benefit crystal clear?
- [ ] Too abstract? - Can I picture what this promises?
- [ ] Would I stop scrolling? - Honest answer
- [ ] Makes sense standalone? - Or needs context?

## Common Pitfalls

### Ideation Issues
- **Surface-level questioning** - Stopping at first "why"
- **Too abstract** - Can't visualize the promise
- **Missing transformation** - No clear before → after

### Formula Issues
- **First-match bias** - Using first formula without exploring
- **Overcomplication** - Trying to say too much

### Optimization Issues
- **Skipping volume** - Writing 2-3 options instead of 10+
- **Hedge words** - "Maybe," "might," "could" kill conviction
- **Generic promises** - "Boost productivity" vs "Double output in 30 days"
- **No specificity** - "Many people" vs "1.5 million students"

### Selection Issues
- **Gut-based selection** - No systematic evaluation
- **Clickbait** - Promise you can't fulfill
