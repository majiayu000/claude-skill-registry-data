# doctor-exam

Conduct a **focused, evidence-driven examination** of ONE triaged suspect area.

## Purpose

This is a **test**, not a verdict. Evidence may falsify the leading hypothesis.

## Epistemic Stance

- Examination tests a hypothesis, it does not prove it
- Evidence may confirm OR falsify
- Confidence should update based on findings
- Scope must remain bounded

## You MUST

- Limit scope to ONE suspect zone
- Gather confirming AND disconfirming evidence
- Update confidence based on findings
- Surface new findings clearly
- State what would falsify the hypothesis

## You MUST NOT

- Fix issues
- Refactor code
- Broaden scope (that's triage's job)
- Propose treatments (that's treatment's job)

## Output

A completed **Exam Note** using the template at `../.resources/assets/EXAM_NOTE.md`.
