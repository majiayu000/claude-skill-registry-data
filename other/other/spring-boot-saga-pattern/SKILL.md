# Spring Boot Saga Pattern

## When to Use

Implement this skill when:

- Building distributed transactions across multiple microservices
- Needing to replace two-phase commit (2PC) with a more scalable solution
- Handling transaction rollback when a service fails in multi-service workflows
- Ensuring eventual consistency in microservices architecture
- Implementing compensating transactions for failed operations
- Coordinating complex business processes spanning multiple services
- Choosing between choreography-based and orchestration-based saga approaches

**Trigger phrases**: distributed transactions, saga pattern, compensating transactions, microservices transaction, eventual consistency, rollback across services, orchestration pattern, choreography pattern

## Overview

The **Saga Pattern** is an architectural pattern for managing distributed transactions in microservices. Instead of using a single ACID transaction across multiple databases, a saga breaks the transaction into a sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates its database and publishes an event or message to trigger the next step. If a step fails, the saga executes **compensating transactions** to undo the changes made by previous steps.

### Key Architectural Decisions

When implementing a saga, make these decisions:

1. **Approach Selection**: Choose between **choreography-based** (event-driven, decoupled) or **orchestration-based** (centralized control, easier to track)
2. **Messaging Platform**: Select Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Spring Cloud Stream
3. **Framework**: Use Axon Framework, Eventuate Tram, Camunda, or Apache Camel
4. **State Persistence**: Store saga state in database for recovery and debugging
5. **Idempotency**: Ensure all operations (especially compensations) are idempotent and retryable

## Instructions

Follow these steps to implement saga pattern for distributed transactions:

### 1. Define Transaction Flow

Identify all services involved in the business process. Map out the sequence of local transactions and their corresponding compensating transactions.

### 2. Choose Saga Approach

Select choreography (event-driven, decentralized) or orchestration (centralized coordinator) based on team expertise and system complexity.

### 3. Design Domain Events

Create events for each transaction step (OrderCreated, PaymentProcessed, InventoryReserved). Include correlationId for tracing.

### 4. Implement Local Transactions

Ensure each service can complete its local transaction atomically within its own database boundary.

### 5. Define Compensating Transactions

For each forward operation, implement a compensating operation that reverses the effect (cancel order, refund payment, release inventory).

### 6. Set Up Message Broker

Configure Kafka or RabbitMQ with appropriate topics/queues. Implement idempotent message consumers.

### 7. Implement Orchestrator (if using orchestration)

Create a saga orchestrator service that tracks saga state, sends commands to participants, and handles compensations on failure.

### 8. Configure Choreography (if using choreography)

Set up event listeners in each service that react to events from other services and trigger next steps.

### 9. Handle Timeouts

Implement timeout mechanisms for each saga step. Configure dead-letter queues for messages that exceed processing time limits.

### 10. Add Monitoring

Track saga execution status, duration, and failure rates. Set up alerts for stuck or failed sagas.

## Two Approaches to Implement Saga

### Choreography-Based Saga

Each microservice publishes events and listens to events from other services. **No central coordinator**.

**Best for**: Greenfield microservice applications with few participants

**Advantages**:
- Simple for small number of services
- Loose coupling between services
- No single point of failure

**Disadvantages**:
- Difficult to track workflow state
- Hard to troubleshoot and maintain
- Complexity grows with number of services

### Orchestration-Based Saga

A **central orchestrator** manages the entire transaction flow and tells services what to do.

**Best for**: Brownfield applications, complex workflows, or when centralized control is needed

**Advantages**:
- Centralized visibility and monitoring
- Easier to troubleshoot and maintain
- Clear transaction flow
- Simplified error handling
- Better for complex workflows

**Disadvantages**:
- Orchestrator can become single point of failure
- Additional infrastructure component

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Define Transaction Flow

Identify the sequence of operations and corresponding compensating transactions:

```
Order → Payment → Inventory → Shipment → Notification
   ↓         ↓         ↓          ↓           ↓
Cancel    Refund    Release    Cancel      Cancel
```

### Step 2: Choose Implementation Approach

- **Choreography**: Spring Cloud Stream with Kafka or RabbitMQ
- **Orchestration**: Axon Framework, Eventuate Tram, Camunda, or Apache Camel

### Step 3: Implement Services with Local Transactions

Each service handles its local ACID transaction and publishes events or responds to commands.

### Step 4: Implement Compensating Transactions

Every forward transaction must have a corresponding compensating transaction. Ensure **idempotency** and **retryability**.

### Step 5: Handle Failure Scenarios

Implement retry logic, timeouts, and dead-letter queues for failed messages.

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

1. **Idempotency**: Ensure compensating transactions execute safely multiple times
2. **Retryability**: Design operations to handle retries without side effects
3. **Atomicity**: Each local transaction must be atomic within its service
4. **Isolation**: Handle concurrent saga executions properly
5. **Eventual Consistency**: Accept that data becomes consistent over time

### Service Design

- Use **constructor injection** exclusively (never field injection)
- Implement services as **stateless** components
- Store saga state in persistent store (database or event store)
- Use **immutable DTOs** (Java records preferred)
- Separate domain logic from infrastructure concerns

### Error Handling

- Implement **circuit breakers** for service calls
- Use **dead-letter queues** for failed messages
- Log all saga events for debugging and monitoring
- Implement **timeout mechanisms** for long-running sagas
- Design **semantic locks** to prevent concurrent updates

### Testing

- Test happy path scenarios
- Test each failure scenario and its compensation
- Test concurrent saga executions
- Test idempotency of compensating transactions
- Use Testcontainers for integration testing

### Monitoring and Observability

- Track saga execution status and duration
- Monitor compensation transaction execution
- Alert on stuck or failed sagas
- Use distributed tracing (Spring Cloud Sleuth, Zipkin)
- Implement health checks for saga coordinators

## Technology Stack

**Spring Boot 3.x** with dependencies:

**Messaging**: Spring Cloud Stream, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Spring AMQP

**Saga Frameworks**: Axon Framework (4.9.0), Eventuate Tram Sagas, Camunda, Apache Camel

**Persistence**: Spring Data JPA, Event Sourcing (optional), Transactional Outbox Pattern

**Monitoring**: Spring Boot Actuator, Micrometer, Distributed Tracing (Sleuth + Zipkin)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Tight Coupling**: Services directly calling each other instead of using events
❌ **Missing Compensations**: Not implementing compensating transactions for every step
❌ **Non-Idempotent Operations**: Compensations that cannot be safely retried
❌ **Synchronous Sagas**: Waiting synchronously for each step (defeats the purpose)
❌ **Lost Messages**: Not handling message delivery failures
❌ **No Monitoring**: Running sagas without visibility into their status
❌ **Shared Database**: Using same database across multiple services
❌ **Ignoring Network Failures**: Not handling partial failures gracefully

## Constraints and Warnings

- Every forward transaction MUST have a corresponding compensating transaction.
- Compensating transactions MUST be idempotent to handle retry scenarios.
- Saga state MUST be persisted to handle failures and recovery.
- Never use synchronous communication between saga participants; it defeats the distributed nature.
- Be aware that sagas provide eventual consistency, not strong consistency.
- Monitor saga execution time and set appropriate timeouts to detect stuck sagas.
- Test all failure scenarios including partial failures to ensure proper compensation.
- Consider using a saga framework (Axon, Eventuate) for complex orchestrations to avoid reinventing the wheel.
- Ensure message brokers are highly available to prevent saga interruption.

## When NOT to Use Saga Pattern

Do not implement this pattern when:

- Single service transactions (use local ACID transactions instead)
- Strong consistency is required (consider monolith or shared database)
- Simple CRUD operations without cross-service dependencies
- Low transaction volume with simple flows
- Team lacks experience with distributed systems

## Examples

### Input: Monolithic Transaction (Anti-Pattern)

```java
@Transactional
public Order createOrder(OrderRequest request) {
    Order order = orderRepository.save(request);
    paymentService.charge(request.getPayment());
    inventoryService.reserve(request.getItems());
    shippingService.schedule(order);
    return order;
}
```

### Output: Saga-Based Distributed Transaction

```java
@Service
public class OrderSagaOrchestrator {
    public OrderSummary createOrder(OrderRequest request) {
        // Step 1: Create order
        Order order = orderService.createOrder(request);

        try {
            // Step 2: Process payment
            Payment payment = paymentService.processPayment(
                new PaymentRequest(order.getId(), request.getAmount()));

            // Step 3: Reserve inventory
            InventoryReservation reservation = inventoryService.reserve(
                new InventoryRequest(order.getItems()));

            // Step 4: Schedule shipping
            Shipment shipment = shippingService.schedule(
                new ShipmentRequest(order.getId()));

            return OrderSummary.completed(order, payment, reservation, shipment);

        } catch (PaymentFailedException e) {
            // Compensate: cancel order
            orderService.cancelOrder(order.getId());
            throw e;
        } catch (InsufficientInventoryException e) {
            // Compensate: refund payment, cancel order
            paymentService.refund(payment.getId());
            orderService.cancelOrder(order.getId());
            throw e;
        }
    }
}
```

### Input: Choreography Event Flow

```java
// Event published when order is created
@EventHandler
public void on(OrderCreatedEvent event) {
    // Trigger payment processing
    paymentService.processPayment(event.getOrderId());
}
```

### Output: Complete Choreography with Compensation

```java
@Service
public class OrderEventHandler {
    @KafkaListener(topics = "order.created")
    public void handleOrderCreated(OrderCreatedEvent event) {
        try {
            paymentService.processPayment(event.toPaymentRequest());
        } catch (PaymentException e) {
            kafkaTemplate.send("order.payment.failed", new PaymentFailedEvent(event.getOrderId()));
        }
    }
}

@Service
public class PaymentEventHandler {
    @KafkaListener(topics = "payment.processed")
    public void handlePaymentProcessed(PaymentProcessedEvent event) {
        inventoryService.reserve(event.toInventoryRequest());
    }

    @KafkaListener(topics = "payment.failed")
    public void handlePaymentFailed(PaymentFailedEvent event) {
        orderService.cancelOrder(event.getOrderId());
    }
}

@Service
public class InventoryEventHandler {
    @KafkaListener(topics = "inventory.reserved")
    public void handleInventoryReserved(InventoryReservedEvent event) {
        shippingService.scheduleShipment(event.toShipmentRequest());
    }

    @KafkaListener(topics = "inventory.insufficient")
    public void handleInsufficientInventory(InsufficientInventoryEvent event) {
        // Compensate: refund payment
        paymentService.refund(event.getPaymentId());
        // Compensate: cancel order
        orderService.cancelOrder(event.getOrderId());
    }
}
```
