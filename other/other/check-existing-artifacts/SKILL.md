# Check Existing Artifacts

Before creating ANY new documentation, plans, or artifacts, ALWAYS check if similar documents already exist in the project. Search for existing epics, PRDs, stories, and planning documents. NEVER create new versions of documents that already exist—update the existing ones instead. Failing to check causes duplicate/conflicting documents, wasted effort, and version confusion.
