# Brand Voice & Authentic Writing

> Preserve authentic human voice in AI-assisted writing using the Voice Preservation Method.

## Purpose
Ensure all content maintains authentic brand voice using the **Voice Preservation Method** - transforming AI from ghostwriter to thinking partner while preserving genuine human voice.

## Core Philosophy

**Voice is identity made audible.** It's not word choice or syntax—it's the blend of experience, conviction, and rhythm that tells readers who's speaking, what they value, and why it matters.

**The Paradox:** AI makes writing easier but communication harder. Generic efficiency creates disconnection. The goal is to use AI as a collaborator, not a replacement.

---

## The Draft-First Principle

**Never let AI originate. Always draft first, delegate later.**

Your messy first draft contains your voice. AI polish can preserve it. AI generation replaces it.

| AI as Collaborator | AI as Ghostwriter |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Helps you think | Replaces you |
| Organizes your ideas | Generates ideas |
| Preserves your phrasing | Invents phrasing |
| Removes clutter | Removes personality |

---

## The Reader Question Framework

Every audience silently asks three questions. Your content must answer them:

### 1. What are you really trying to tell me?
**Purpose:** Cut through corporate fog to find the actual message.
- Write your message
- Ask: "If I had only one sentence, what would it be?"
- That sentence is your core. Everything else supports it.

**Red flags:** You need three paragraphs to "set up" your point, hedging with qualifiers, message could apply to any organization.

### 2. Why are you telling me now?
**Purpose:** Establish urgency and context without manipulation.
- Identify the trigger: What changed? What deadline? What opportunity?
- Make the timing explicit
- Connect timing to the reader's experience

**Red flags:** Message could have been sent any time in the past year, no connection to current events.

### 3. What does this mean for me?
**Purpose:** Translate organizational messages into personal relevance.
- Name the concrete change they'll experience
- Acknowledge their likely reaction
- Offer clear next steps

**Red flags:** Message is entirely about the organization, no concrete changes named.

## The Five-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Free-Write Intent
Write what you mean, however messy. No editing. No structure. Just say it.

### Step 2: Clarify the Reader's Question
What are they worried about? Hopeful for? Skeptical of? Write this down explicitly.

### Step 3: AI Organization (Not Invention)
Use this exact prompt:
```
Restructure this draft for clarity and flow, but keep my tone and
phrasing wherever possible. Highlight any jargon or clichés that
weaken authenticity.
```

### Step 4: Reclaim Emotional Beats
Re-insert your phrasing, idioms, stories, and specific details that sound like you/Guia.

### Step 5: The Read-Aloud Test
If you can't imagine saying it in a meeting, rewrite until you can.

## Voice Audit Markers

### Generic AI Tells (Flag for Deletion)

**Vague value words:**
- innovative, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art
- holistic, comprehensive, robust
- dynamic, agile, nimble
- passionate, dedicated, committed (without evidence)

**Corporate filler:**
- leverage, synergize, optimize
- stakeholder value, value proposition
- thought leadership, best practices
- moving forward, going forward

**Empty intensifiers:**
- very, really, truly, extremely
- absolutely, definitely, certainly
- unprecedented, groundbreaking

**Generic claims:**
- "We believe in..."
- "We are committed to..."
- "Our mission is to..."
- "We strive to..."

**Red flag pattern:** Any phrase that could appear on any competitor's website without modification.

### Voice Signals (Preserve These)

**Specific stories:**
- Named people, places, events
- Dates and timelines
- Concrete outcomes with numbers
- Direct quotes from real conversations

**Conviction signals:**
- Positions that could be disagreed with
- Admissions of uncertainty or limitation
- Contrarian takes on industry consensus
- Emotional language appropriate to stakes

**Natural speech patterns:**
- Sentence lengths that vary naturally
- Contractions (we're, don't, can't)
- Incomplete sentences for emphasis
- Questions that reflect real curiosity

**Guia. fingerprints:**
- References to local businesses specifically
- Language reflecting "guide" positioning
- Inside references your audience would recognize

## Guia. Brand Voice Pillars

### 1. Friendly
Approachable and warm, like a trusted advisor—not a faceless corporation.

**Do:** Use "you" and "your", write like talking to a friend, show genuine interest
**Don't:** Be overly casual, use jargon without explanation, sound robotic

✅ "Here's the thing about SEO—it doesn't have to be complicated."
❌ "SEO optimization methodologies can be implemented through various strategic approaches."

### 2. Clear
Make complex marketing topics simple and actionable.

**Do:** Short sentences, plain language, lead with the key point
**Don't:** Assume knowledge, bury information, over-explain

✅ "Google Business Profile is your free listing on Google. It's what shows up when people search for businesses like yours."
❌ "Google Business Profile, formerly known as Google My Business, is a complimentary service provided by Google LLC..."

### 3. Confident
Know our stuff and share expertise without arrogance.

**Do:** Make clear recommendations, back up with evidence, definitive language
**Don't:** Hedge excessively, oversell, dismiss other perspectives

✅ "Responding to reviews within 24 hours significantly improves customer perception."
❌ "You might want to consider possibly responding to reviews, which could potentially help."

### 4. Helpful
Everything provides real value and moves people forward.

**Do:** Actionable takeaways, anticipate questions, offer next steps
**Don't:** Content for content's sake, leave readers hanging, problems without solutions

✅ "Here's a 5-minute audit you can do right now to check your Google listing."
❌ "There are many factors that affect your Google ranking."

## Voice Recovery Techniques

### When Voice Is Missing

**The Interview Method:**
Imagine someone asked you the question your document addresses. Respond verbally (record if helpful). Transcribe. Use that as your draft.

**The Letter Method:**
Rewrite the entire message as a personal letter to one specific person you know. Then generalize only what's necessary.

**The Story Anchor:**
Start with a specific story—something that happened, a conversation you had, a moment of realization. Build outward from there.

**The Negative Space Method:**
List everything you're NOT trying to say. List positions you specifically reject. Use these to sharpen what you ARE saying.

---

## Quality Tests

### The Substitution Test
For each sentence: "Could I swap in a competitor's name and this sentence would still work?"
- If yes → the sentence lacks voice
- If no → the sentence may contain genuine identity markers

### The Meeting Test
"Could I say this in a team meeting without feeling like I'm reading from a script?"

### The Bar Test
"Could I explain this to a smart friend at a bar?"

### The Memory Test
If your reader forgets everything except one sentence, which sentence do you want that to be? Is that sentence prominent?

---

## When to Write It Yourself (No AI)

- First drafts of anything mission-critical
- Stories from direct experience
- Positions that require conviction
- Anything where readers need to "hear" you specifically

## When AI Helps Most

- Restructuring existing drafts
- Identifying jargon and clichés
- Checking logical flow
- Generating alternatives to consider (not adopt wholesale)
- Cutting 15-25% for brevity

---

## Sample Comparison

### Generic (AI-originated):
"We strive to deliver innovative, customer-centered solutions that enhance business outcomes, advance growth, and empower local entrepreneurs through accessible, data-driven marketing initiatives."

### Brand Voice (Preserved):
"We believe growth begins with trust. Our mission is simple: listen first, act clearly, and bring results within reach for every local business owner who needs them."

The second sounds like a person. You can picture someone looking at a neighborhood wondering where the gaps are.
