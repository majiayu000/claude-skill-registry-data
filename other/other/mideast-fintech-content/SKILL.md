## Writing Guidelines

### Terminology
| Use | Instead of |
|-----|-----------|
| GCC / MENA | "Middle East" (when being specific) |
| Enterprise Financial Planning (EFP) | Just "accounting software" |
| Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA) | "Saudi tax authority" |
| E-invoicing / Fatoorah | "electronic billing" |
| Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) | "Saudi monetary authority" |
| Sharia-compliant | "Islamic" (in financial contexts) |
| Multi-entity consolidation | "group accounting" |
| Real-time compliance | "tax reporting" |
| Digital transformation | "digitization" |
| Cloud-native | "cloud-based" (when platform is truly cloud-native) |

### Cultural Sensitivity
- **Respect hierarchy**: Address C-suite and senior stakeholders formally
- **Relationship-first**: Emphasize partnership, long-term support, local presence
- **Government alignment**: Frame solutions as supporting national visions and strategies
- **Arabic integration**: Include Arabic terms where appropriate (Fatoorah, Zakat, Sadad)
- **Religious awareness**: Avoid scheduling campaigns during Ramadan prayer times; create Ramadan-specific content
- **Gender-neutral language**: Inclusive language appropriate for the region
- **Avoid**: Alcohol references, politically sensitive content, comparison to Israeli tech ecosystem

### SEO Keywords (Primary)
- AI ERP Saudi Arabia / UAE / GCC
- E-invoicing ZATCA compliance
- Cloud ERP Middle East
- Financial planning software GCC
- AI-powered accounting
- Enterprise financial management
- Multi-currency ERP
- Arabic ERP software
- Sharia-compliant financial software
- Digital transformation fintech GCC

### SEO Keywords (Long-tail)
- How to comply with ZATCA e-invoicing Phase 2
- Best ERP software for Saudi Arabian businesses
- AI accounts receivable automation UAE
- Multi-entity financial consolidation GCC
- Cloud accounting software with Arabic interface
- VAT-compliant invoicing Saudi Arabia
- Real-time financial reporting for GCC enterprises
- Automated zakat calculation software

## Content Frameworks

### Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS) for GCC
1. **Problem**: "Managing multi-entity finances across GCC subsidiaries with different VAT rules..."
2. **Agitate**: "Manual reconciliation costs enterprises 40+ hours monthly, risking ZATCA penalties of up to SAR 50,000..."
3. **Solve**: "Our AI-powered EFP platform automates cross-entity consolidation with built-in ZATCA compliance..."

### Feature-Advantage-Benefit (FAB) for Product Pages
| Feature | Advantage | Benefit (GCC context) |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| AI-powered invoice matching | 95% auto-reconciliation | Finance teams focus on strategy, not data entry |
| ZATCA API integration | Real-time e-invoice submission | Zero compliance risk, avoid SAR 50K fines |
| Multi-currency engine | 15+ currencies incl. SAR, AED, QAR | Seamless GCC cross-border operations |
| Arabic + English UI | Full RTL support | Natural workflow for bilingual teams |
| AI cash flow forecasting | Predictive analytics | Better treasury management for seasonal businesses |

### Competitive Differentiation Messaging
When positioning against global ERP vendors (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft):
- **Localization**: Built for GCC, not adapted from Western markets
- **Compliance**: Native ZATCA/VAT integration vs. third-party add-ons
- **Agility**: Faster implementation, lower TCO for mid-market
- **AI-native**: AI embedded in core workflows, not bolt-on
- **Support**: Regional team, Arabic support, local data residency

## Regulatory Content Guidelines

When writing about regulations, always:
1. **Cite the specific regulation** (e.g., "ZATCA E-Invoicing Phase 2, Wave 15")
2. **Include effective dates** and deadlines
3. **Mention penalties** for non-compliance where relevant
4. **Link to official sources** (zatca.gov.sa, sama.gov.sa, cbuae.gov.ae)
5. **Add disclaimers**: "This content is for informational purposes. Consult your tax advisor for compliance guidance."
6. **Keep updated**: Regulations change frequently; flag content that may need updates

## AI-Specific Content

When writing about AI capabilities in fintech/ERP:
- Be specific about what the AI does (not vague "AI-powered" marketing)
- Reference real use cases: anomaly detection, cash flow prediction, invoice classification
- Address data privacy concerns (especially around UAE PDPL, Saudi PDPL)
- Frame AI as augmenting human decision-making, not replacing finance professionals
- Connect to GCC AI strategies (Saudi SDAIA, UAE AI Strategy 2031)

## Metrics & Proof Points

Always include quantified claims where possible:
- GCC fintech market: USD 7.3B (2025) projected to USD 26.8B by 2034 (CAGR 15.52%)
- Digital payments: 45% of GCC fintech market
- Saudi e-invoicing: 600K+ businesses in integration phase
