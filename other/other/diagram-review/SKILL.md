# /diagram-review

Perform comprehensive analysis of architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and technical drawings using Sonnet sub-agents.

## Usage

```
/diagram-review <image-path>
/diagram-review +Attachments/architecture-diagram.png
/diagram-review +Attachments/data-flow.png --type "C4"
/diagram-review +Attachments/process-flow.png --project "MyDataIntegration"
```

## Instructions

This skill uses **Sonnet model sub-agents** for thorough diagram analysis with vision capabilities.

### Phase 1: Diagram Loading

1. Verify the image exists at the specified path
2. Identify diagram type if specified or detect automatically
3. Load project context if provided

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Analysis (Sonnet Sub-Agents)

Launch these sub-agents using `model: "sonnet"`:

**Agent 1: Component Extraction** (Sonnet)
```
Task: Extract all components and elements from the diagram
- Read the image file using the Read tool
- Identify all boxes, shapes, and containers
- Extract all labels and text
- Note icons, symbols, and visual indicators
- Capture any legend or key information
Return: Complete component inventory with labels
```

**Agent 2: Relationship Mapping** (Sonnet)
```
Task: Map all connections and relationships
- Read the image file
- Identify all lines, arrows, and connectors
- Determine direction of data/process flow
- Note relationship types (dependency, data flow, API call, etc.)
- Identify any protocols or technologies on connections
- Map parent-child or containment relationships
Return: Relationship matrix with flow directions
```

**Agent 3: Architecture Pattern Analysis** (Sonnet)
```
Task: Analyse architectural patterns and quality
- Read the image file
- Identify the diagram type (C4, UML, flowchart, network, etc.)
- Recognise architectural patterns (microservices, layered, event-driven)
- Assess separation of concerns
- Identify potential single points of failure
- Note security boundaries if visible
- Evaluate completeness and clarity
Return: Pattern analysis with architectural assessment
```

**Agent 4: Technology & Integration Analysis** (Sonnet)
```
Task: Identify technologies and integrations
- Read the image file
- Recognise technology logos and icons
- Identify cloud services (AWS, Azure, SAP)
- Note databases, queues, APIs
- Map external system integrations
- Identify known YourOrg systems (SAP LegacyEngineeringSystem, MROPlatform, DataPlatform, etc.)
Return: Technology inventory with integration points
```

### Phase 3: Compile Report

```markdown
# Diagram Analysis

**Image**: {{filename}}
**Analysed**: {{DATE}}
**Diagram Type**: {{C4/UML/Flowchart/Network/ERD/Other}}
**Project**: {{if specified}}
