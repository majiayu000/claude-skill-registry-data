name: Backend Models
description: Define and configure database models with proper naming, relationships, timestamps, data types, constraints, and validation. Use this skill when creating or editing model files in app/Models/, Eloquent model classes, model relationships (hasMany, belongsTo, etc.), database table structures, model attributes and casts, model factories, or seeders. Use when working on model validation logic, database constraints, foreign key relationships, indexes, scopes, accessors, mutators, or any ORM-related model configuration.

# Backend Models

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend models.

## When to use this skill

- When creating or editing model files in `app/Models/` or similar model directories
- When defining Eloquent model classes and their properties
- When configuring model relationships (hasMany, belongsTo, belongsToMany, hasOne, morphTo, etc.)
- When setting up model casts, fillable properties, or hidden attributes
- When implementing model validation rules or business logic
- When configuring database timestamps (created_at, updated_at) on models
- When defining model scopes (query scopes, local scopes, global scopes)
- When creating model factories for testing or seeding
- When writing database seeders that use models
- When implementing model accessors or mutators for attribute transformation
- When setting up soft deletes or other model traits
- When configuring model events or observers
