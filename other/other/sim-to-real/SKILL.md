# Sim-to-Real Transfer Skill

## Overview

Expert skill for bridging the simulation-to-reality gap through domain randomization, system identification, and transfer validation techniques.

## Capabilities

- Implement domain randomization (physics, appearance, dynamics)
- Configure system identification for simulation parameters
- Set up adaptive domain randomization
- Implement domain adaptation techniques
- Configure noise injection for robust policies
- Set up reality gap metrics and monitoring
- Implement progressive network transfer
- Configure latency simulation
- Set up sensor noise modeling
- Implement hardware-in-the-loop validation

## Target Processes

- sim-to-real-validation.js
- digital-twin-development.js
- rl-robot-control.js
- field-testing-validation.js

## Dependencies

- Simulation environments (Gazebo, Isaac Sim)
- Physical robot access
- System identification tools

## Usage Context

This skill is invoked when processes require transferring simulation-trained models or behaviors to real robot hardware with minimal performance degradation.

## Output Artifacts

- Domain randomization configurations
- System identification results
- Reality gap analysis reports
- Transfer validation metrics
- Sensor noise models
- Calibrated simulation parameters
