# Sketch

Sketch is the native Mac design tool. While Figma dominates the web, Sketch remains beloved for its native performance and privacy. 2025 updates focus on **Command Bar** and **Stacks**.

## When to Use

- **MacOS Native**: Feels like a real Mac app.
- **Offline**: Works fully offline.
- **Privacy**: Files can be local.

## Core Concepts

### Symbols

Reusable components.

### Smart Layout

Sketch's version of Auto Layout.

### Workspaces

Cloud collaboration (if chosen).

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use Libraries**: Share symbols across documents.
- **Use Color Variables**: Keep design consistent.

**Don't**:

- **Don't expect Windows support**: It is Mac only.
