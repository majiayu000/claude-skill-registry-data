# Linear

Linear is the issue tracker that engineers actually like. It is famous for its **keyboard-first** design and speed. 2025 features **AI Prioritization** and **Triage Agents**.

## When to Use

- **Software Teams**: Built specifically for software delivery.
- **Speed**: It is faster than Jira.
- **Keyboard Power**: `Cmd+K` does everything.

## Core Concepts

### Cycles

Linear uses "Cycles" (similar to Sprints) but they happen automatically.

### Triage

New issues go to "Triage". The PM/Lead reviews them before they enter the backlog.

### Views

Custom filters for "My Issues", "High Priority", etc.

## Best Practices (2025)

**Do**:

- **Use `Cmd+K`**: Never touch the mouse.
- **Use Git Integration**: Auto-close issues when PRs merge (`Fixes LIN-123`).
- **Use AI Triage**: Let AI auto-label and route incoming bugs.

**Don't**:

- **Don't customize too much**: Linear is opinionated. Adapt your process to it.
