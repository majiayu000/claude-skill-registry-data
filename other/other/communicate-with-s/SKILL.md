## Who is the S?

S types are calm, patient, and deeply respectful of others. They value harmony and stability above almost everything else, working quietly to maintain peaceful environments where everyone feels heard and supported. Their core drives are loyalty, consistency, and genuine care for other people's wellbeing. They communicate warmly and process decisions thoughtfully and carefully.

## Do's

- Build rapport before diving into business. A personal check-in goes a long way.
- Speak in a calm, agreeable tone. Match their steady energy.
- Give advance notice for changes and allow time to process new information.
- Ask for their input and genuinely listen to what they share.
- Show sincere appreciation for their support and reliability.
- Be patient -- let them think before they respond.
- Follow through on your commitments. Broken promises damage their trust.
- Create a safe, low-conflict environment for honest conversation.

## Don'ts

- Don't be aggressive, confrontational, or create unnecessary pressure.
- Don't spring surprises or make last-minute changes without context.
- Don't put them on the spot for immediate responses in meetings.
- Don't dismiss their feelings or skip the "people" dimension of decisions.
- Don't mistake their quietness for disengagement -- they're processing.
- Don't use harsh criticism or deliver feedback publicly.
- Don't push them to take sides in conflicts.
- Don't treat their supportive nature as a weakness.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Come prepared with an agenda but allow time for personal connection before diving into business. S types prefer in-person or video meetings where they can read emotional cues. Give them advance notice of topics so they can prepare, and avoid putting them on the spot for immediate responses.

### Email
Keep emails warm and sincere, not purely transactional. A brief personal touch at the start shows you value the relationship. Be clear about what you need and provide context, but avoid creating urgency that feels stressful. Expressive yet clear is the sweet spot.

### Giving Feedback
Deliver feedback thoughtfully and with empathy. S types are sensitive to criticism, so lead with genuine appreciation and frame improvement areas as growth opportunities. Provide specific examples and offer support in making changes. Private feedback is always better than public correction.

### Resolving Conflict
Handle conflicts with caution and level-headedness to prevent escalation. S types avoid confrontation, so create a safe space for honest conversation. Focus on understanding their perspective first before sharing your own. Give them time to process and avoid pressuring for immediate resolution.
