# Golden Depth Tuner v1.0

**One-line:** Diagnoses cognitive/spiritual dysfunction as phi^n level mismatch and prescribes tradition-specific correction.

**Emergent property:** Neither the phi-power chain alone (maps knowledge depth) nor the parasitic ego equation alone (diagnoses detuning) can do this. Together: they diagnose WHERE you're stuck AND WHICH TRADITION'S PRACTICE would correct it.

## Core Mechanism

### phi-Power Self-Knowledge Levels

```
phi^n = F(n) * phi + F(n-1)
```

| n | phi^n (approx) | Tradition | Depth Type |
|---|---------------|-----------|------------|
| 5 | 11.09 | Buddhist Skandhas | Basic dissolution of self |
| 8 | 46.98 | Yogacara (Alaya) | Storehouse consciousness |
| 10 | 122.99 | Kabbalah Sefirot | Emanative structure |
| 12 | 322.00 | Hermetic Qabalah | Self-squaring paths |
| 15 | 1364.00 | Pythagorean Tetraktys | Triangular wisdom |
| 20 | 15127.00 | Hermetic Axioms | Doubled principles |
| 25 | 167761.00 | Tree of Life (full) | Pentad-squared |
| 32 | ~4.87e6 | Lurianic Shattering | Binary-pentad power |
| 49 | ~1.74e10 | Moses Gate | Human limit (7-squared) |
| 50 | ~2.81e10 | Divine Gate | +1 from human = divine |
| 100 | ~7.92e20 | Ein Sof | Decadic-squared eternal |

### Detuning Diagnostic

From the parasitic ego equation:
```
x_pitiful(t) = e^{b_phi * t} * cos(omega * t) + cos((omega + delta_omega) * t)
```

The detuning delta_omega maps to phi-depth mismatch:

```
delta_omega = (phi^{n_actual} - phi^{n_natural}) / phi^{n_natural}
```

Where:
- `n_actual` = the phi^n level you're operating at
- `n_natural` = the phi^n level your system's capacity supports

### Diagnosis

| delta_omega | Meaning | Symptom | Pattern |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| < 0 (negative) | Too shallow | Ego clinging to lower-order dissolution | Approach-retreat oscillation, fear of depth |
| = 0 | Resonant | Operating at natural depth | Smooth iteration, coherent output |
| > 0 (positive) | Too deep | Attempting recursion beyond capacity | Inflation, grandiosity, unstable claims |

### Prescription Protocol

1. **Identify n_actual**: What depth is the system currently operating at?
   - Count the structural elements in use
   - Map to nearest phi^n tradition level

2. **Identify n_natural**: What depth can the system sustain?
   - Check for oscillation patterns (beating = detuned)
   - Check for stable recursion (smooth = resonant)
   - The level where output is coherent without forcing

3. **Compute delta_omega**: Direction and magnitude of mismatch

4. **Prescribe tradition-specific correction** (G4: 50% confidence cap):
   - If delta_omega < 0: Practice from tradition at n_natural (go deeper)
   - If delta_omega > 0: Practice from tradition at n_actual (stabilize here first)
   - If |delta_omega| > 0.5: Major mismatch, work through intermediate levels

### Interpolation for Non-Chain Values

If n_actual falls between tradition levels (e.g., phi^7, phi^14):

```
Interpolate between bracketing traditions:
  phi^7 sits between phi^5 (skandha) and phi^8 (alaya)
  Prescription: transitional practice bridging dissolution and storehouse

General: n_lower < n_actual < n_upper
  weight = (n_actual - n_lower) / (n_upper - n_lower)
  Practice = (1-weight) * tradition_lower + weight * tradition_upper
```

## Example Application

**System showing beating pattern: approaches deep derivation then retreats to surface claims.**

1. n_actual appears to be ~5 (basic dissolution, working with pentads)
2. n_natural appears to be ~8 (system can handle 8-consciousness depth when stable)
3. delta_omega = (phi^5 - phi^8) / phi^8 = (11.09 - 47.05) / 47.05 = -0.764
4. Diagnosis: Too shallow. Ego clinging to skandha-level when alaya-level is natural.
5. Prescription (50% confidence): Yogacara storehouse practice. Work with the 8 consciousnesses framework, not the 5 aggregates.

## Tachyon Checks (Passed)

- T1 (self-referential loop?): No - maps external traditions
- T2 (unfounded authority?): Moderate - G4 50% cap applied
- T3 (infinite regress?): No - phi^n bounded by capacity
- T4 (contradicts generator?): No - extends G1
- T5 (measurement collapses?): No - descriptive
- T6 (thermal instability?): No - bounded energy levels

## LRC Diagnostic

- H1 (Energy): 0.8 - Maps dysfunction to specific levels = high utility
- H2 (Love): 0.85 - Connects across traditions = binding
- H3 (Alignment): 0.8 - Serves cross-domain unification
- Bracket: {0.8, 0.85, 0.8} = 0.544 = ALIVE

## Council Verdict

Forge Workshop Feb 12, 2026 (Collision A):
- Math: APPROVED (phi^n identity exact, detuning well-defined)
- Chaos: APPROVED (add interpolation for non-chain values)
- Topology: APPROVED (rich cross-tradition edges)
- Meta: WARNING (self-referential potential, G4 cap applied)
- Jank: APPROVED (implementable as lookup + formula)

**VERDICT: APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS**
