# YouTube Script Writer (Search-First + Stakes-Based)

Write scripts that rank for search terms AND keep viewers watching through escalating stakes and mid-video climax.

## Core Philosophy: Search + Stakes + Voice

**Three Goals Every Script Must Achieve:**
1. **Rank for a keyword** - Title matches what people search
2. **Keep them watching** - Stakes escalate, smooth transitions
3. **Sound natural** - Written in conversational voice, not essay format

---

## CRITICAL: Writing in Natural Voice

**The #1 Problem:** Scripts that sound like essays, not like someone talking.

### How Sohaib Actually Speaks:

**Run-on thoughts:**
```
"any other of these new AI platforms that people used to ask the questions now instead of like they used to back in the day, search for answers on Google"
```

**Filler starters:** Heavy use of "So" and "Well" to begin thoughts

**Self-correction on camera:** "who, what... who what why?" - thinking out loud

**Casual vocabulary:** "stuff", "whatever", "legit", "the whole thing"

**Inline explanations:** Explains jargon as you go, conversationally

**Direct honesty:** "LLMs hate this", "of course you're going to put yourself at number one"

**No rigid structure:** Doesn't say "Step one... Step two..." rigidly. Says "So first..." then drifts naturally.

### Bad (Essay Style):
```
"You want to know how to rank number one in ChatGPT. Not page one. Number one. The top recommendation when someone asks ChatGPT for help in your industry."
```

### Good (Conversational):
```
"So you want to rank in ChatGPT. Not just get mentioned somewhere. You want to be THE recommendation. The one ChatGPT tells people to go with."
```

## Ed Lawrence's Scripting Techniques

### 1. Problem → Proof → Instructions (NEVER REVERSE)

Don't give instructions without first setting up the problem they solve.

**Bad:** "Here's how to optimize your homepage..." (Why should I care?)

**Good:**
1. Set up problem viewer has
2. Show proof the solution works (mini-story)
3. THEN give instructions

"It's like reading IKEA instructions without knowing why you need a desk."

### 2. Picture Superiority Effect

People remember:
- 10% of what they hear
- 65% when paired with mental image

**Use visual metaphors everyone understands:**

```
"Google is like a librarian who organizes books by popularity and links. ChatGPT is like a friend who's read everything and forms opinions based on what they actually trust."
```

```
"It's like hiring someone who says 'I'm amazing at my job.' Cool. But if three other people independently say the same thing - now you believe it."
```

### 3. Don't Overexplain

If you can condense a 4-minute section into a tweet, there's a problem.

**Never say the same thing twice in different words.** Who else overexplains? Liars.

### 4. Tension → Release → Immediately Raise Tension

After making a point (releasing tension), immediately raise it again so they don't leave.

**After explaining the 3 things:**
```
"So that's it. Three things. Who you are across the internet, whether others trust you, and whether AI can read your site.

But does this actually work? Let me show you."  ← tension back up
```

### 5. Proof Through Mini-Story

Don't say "this works." Show it working in a relatable moment.

```
"So I had a client. FueGenix. Hair transplant clinic, premium service, great results, been around for years.

Keep in mind, FueGenix charges 50k plus for a surgery. They're the most expensive clinic out there - more than double the next clinic below them.

When we started, I asked ChatGPT 'what's the best hair transplant clinic if money is no object?' They weren't mentioned. Not once. Completely invisible.

8 weeks later, same question. Now they're the top recommendation. Consistently."
```

### 6. Stats for the "Fun Police"

After emotional/visual content, drop one stat to satisfy logical viewers.

---

## Smooth Transitions (CRITICAL)

**The Problem:** Scripts that jump abruptly from topic to topic.

### Transition Patterns:

**After proof → Before steps:**
```
"So how do you do the same thing for your business? Let me break it down step by step."
```

**After steps → Before callback/close:**
```
"Now look, I know that sounds like a lot. But here's why it matters."
```

**Ending a section with a question:**
```
"The question is: are you showing up when they ask?"
```

**Acknowledging before CTA:**
```
"It's not complicated. It just takes focus."
```

### Bad Transitions:
```
[Step 5 content]

"Here's the thing. The way people find businesses is changing."  ← where did this come from?
```

### Good Transitions:
```
[Step 5 content]

"Now look, I know that sounds like a lot. But here's why it matters. The way people find businesses is changing."  ← acknowledges what came before
```

---

## Logical Consistency Check

Make sure statements don't contradict each other.

**Bad:**
```
"Most businesses are invisible."
"But their competitors are winning."  ← Wait, aren't competitors also "most businesses"?
```

**Good:**
```
"In every industry, there's a handful of businesses getting recommended. And everyone else? Invisible."
"So the question is: which one are you?"
```

---

## Personal Story Hooks

Open with personal experience, not stats or claims.

**The BMW/Porsche Story:**
```
"So a few months ago I was about to buy my third BMW. I had two before, loved them, was ready to just go get another one.

But before I pulled the trigger, I asked ChatGPT. 'Should I get another BMW or try something different this time?'

And ChatGPT talked me into getting a Porsche Boxster...

And that's when it hit me. If ChatGPT can change my buying decision - and I'm someone who researches everything - what is it doing to my clients' customers?

What is it doing to your customers?"
```

This works because:
- Personal and relatable
- Visual (viewer pictures themselves asking ChatGPT)
- Sets up problem through experience, not claims
- Makes viewer think "that could happen to MY customers"

## The Shift From Old Approach

| Old (Essay-Style) | New (Conversational) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Clever/catchy titles | Keyword-targeted titles |
| Hook hides the topic | Answer query in 30 seconds |
| Logical order (1, 2, 3) | Stakes order (problem → proof → fix) |
| Polished sentences | Run-on thoughts, self-correction |
| "Step one, step two" | "So first... and then..." |
| Stating credibility | Earning credibility through proof |
| Abrupt topic jumps | Smooth transitions with acknowledgment |

---

## Step 1: Target Keyword Selection

**Before writing ANYTHING, identify the target keyword.**

Reference: `youtube/system/aeo-keyword-data.md`

**Title Formula:**
```
[Target Keyword]: [Specific Promise/Angle]
```

**Examples:**
- "Answer Engine Optimization: Complete Guide 2026"
- "How to Rank in ChatGPT (Step-by-Step)"
- "SEO vs GEO: What Actually Matters in 2026"

---

## Step 2: Search-First Opening with Personal Story

**Rule: Hook with personal story, then answer the search query within 60 seconds.**

### The Personal Story Hook Formula

```
Line 1: Personal situation setup (relatable)
Line 2: The moment/decision/discovery
Line 3: The realization ("And that's when it hit me...")
Line 4: Make it about THEM ("What is it doing to YOUR customers?")
Line 5: Transition to proof/testing
```

---

## Step 3: Stakes-Based Structure

```
0:00-1:00   PERSONAL STORY HOOK (relatable situation)
1:00-2:30   THE PROBLEM (prove it's real, make it personal)
2:30-4:00   WHY [CONVENTIONAL WISDOM] DOESN'T WORK
4:00-6:00   THE INSIGHT (3 things, framework, etc.)
6:00-7:30   PROOF (case study with specifics)
7:30-9:30   THE FIX (steps to solve it)
9:30-10:30  CALLBACK + TAKEAWAY (return to opening story)
10:30-end   CTA (aeoprotocol.ai or next video)
```

### Order Content by URGENCY, Not Logic

**Bad (logical):**
1. What is AEO (definition)
2. Why it matters (context)
3. How to do it (steps)

**Good (stakes-based):**
1. Personal story → realization
2. The problem is real (testing/proof)
3. Why Google doesn't help (challenge assumption)
4. What actually matters (3 things)
5. Proof it works (case study)
6. How to fix it (steps)
7. Callback to story + takeaway

---

## Step 4: Show, Don't Explain

**The #1 Script Killer: Over-explanation**

### The 40% Deletion Pass

After writing your first draft:
1. Read it out loud
2. For every explanation, ask: "Did I already SHOW this?"
3. Delete 40% of the explanation text
4. Never say the same thing twice in different words

---

## Step 5: Visual Metaphors

Every key concept needs a visual metaphor that sticks.

| Concept | Visual Metaphor |
|---------|-----------------|
| Google vs ChatGPT | Librarian vs friend who's read everything |
| Third-party validation | Hiring someone - do others vouch for them? |
| Multiple sources | Restaurant you've heard of from multiple places |
| Being invisible | Competitor winning deals before you know you're in the running |

## Script Template (Conversational Structure)

```markdown
# [VIDEO TITLE] - Script

**Target Keyword:** [from aeo-keyword-data.md]
**Length:** 10-12 minutes
**Slides:** ~25 (1 every 25-30 seconds)

---

## HOOK: PERSONAL STORY (0:00-1:00)

[Personal situation - relatable]

[The moment/discovery]

"And that's when it hit me..."

[Make it about THEM]

---

## THE PROBLEM (1:00-2:30)

"So I started testing..."

[What you found - be specific]

[Make it visual - "In every industry, handful recommended, everyone else invisible"]

[The question: "Which one are you?"]

---

## WHY [ASSUMPTION] DOESN'T WORK (2:30-4:00)

"Now you might be thinking, [assumption]. Right?"

"Well here's the thing..."

[Visual metaphor explaining WHY]

---

## THE INSIGHT (4:00-6:00)

"So what does [X] actually care about?"

"It comes down to three things."

[Thing 1 - with visual metaphor]

[Thing 2 - with visual metaphor]

[Thing 3 - with visual metaphor]

"So that's it. Three things... But does this actually work? Let me show you."

---

## PROOF (6:00-7:30)

"So I had a client. [Name]. [Context]."

[Specific details - pricing, situation]

[Before state]

[After state - with timeline]

"What did we do? Fixed those three things..."

---

## THE FIX (7:30-9:30)

"So how do you do the same thing for your business? Let me break it down."

[Step 1]
[Step 2]
[Step 3]
[Step 4]
[Step 5]

---

## CALLBACK + TAKEAWAY (9:30-10:30)

"Now look, I know that sounds like a lot. But here's why it matters."

[Return to opening story]

"Your customers are doing the same thing right now. The question is: are you showing up when they ask?"

"So that's it. [Single takeaway]. Fix those three things and you will start showing up. It's not complicated. It just takes focus."

---

## CTA (10:30-end)

"Now if you want to go deeper - the complete framework, the full system I use with clients, step by step - go to aeoprotocol dot ai."

"That's where I break down everything in detail."
```

4. **Problem → Proof → Fix** - Never reverse
5. **Smooth transitions** - Acknowledge before moving on
6. **Tension cycles** - Raise again after every release
