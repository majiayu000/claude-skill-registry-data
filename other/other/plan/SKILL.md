# Task Planning

## Workflow
1. **Gather Information**: Explore codebase and list dependencies.
2. **Draft Plan**:
   - **Objective**: Goal of the task.
   - **Approach**: High-level strategy.
   - **Steps**: Sequential actions.
   - **Verification**: How to prove it works.
3. **Clarify**: Include **at least 3 clarifying questions** with proposed answers.
4. **Approve**: Wait for user "go ahead" (empty response = approval).
5. **Implement**: Execute only after approval.

## Principles
- **Zero-Impact**: Do not modify files during planning.
- **Iterative**: Refine based on feedback.
- **Concise**: Keep plans readable and progress tracked via TODOs.
