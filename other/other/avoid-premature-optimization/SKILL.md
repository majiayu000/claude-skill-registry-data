# Avoid Premature Optimization

Write clear, correct code first. Only optimize after measuring with real data to identify actual bottlenecks. Micro-optimizations often provide negligible benefit while reducing readability. However, choose appropriate algorithms and data structures from the start—this is design, not optimization. Document performance-critical sections and the reasoning behind optimizations.
