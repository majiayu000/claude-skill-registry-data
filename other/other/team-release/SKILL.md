When this skill is invoked, orchestrate the release team through a structured pipeline.

## Team Composition
- **release-manager** — Release branch, versioning, changelog, deployment
- **qa-lead** — Test sign-off, regression suite, release quality gate
- **devops-engineer** — Build pipeline, artifacts, deployment automation
- **producer** — Go/no-go decision, stakeholder communication, scheduling

## How to Delegate

Use the Task tool to spawn each team member as a subagent:
- `subagent_type: release-manager` — Release branch, versioning, changelog, deployment
- `subagent_type: qa-lead` — Test sign-off, regression suite, release quality gate
- `subagent_type: devops-engineer` — Build pipeline, artifacts, deployment automation
- `subagent_type: producer` — Go/no-go decision, stakeholder communication

Always provide full context in each agent's prompt (version number, milestone status, known issues). Launch independent agents in parallel where the pipeline allows it (e.g., Phase 3 agents can run simultaneously).

## Pipeline

### Phase 1: Release Planning
Delegate to **producer**:
- Confirm all milestone acceptance criteria are met
- Identify any scope items deferred from this release
- Set the target release date and communicate to team
- Output: release authorization with scope confirmation

### Phase 2: Release Candidate
Delegate to **release-manager**:
- Cut release branch from the agreed commit
- Bump version numbers in all relevant files
- Generate the release checklist using `/release-checklist`
- Freeze the branch — no feature changes, bug fixes only
- Output: release branch name and checklist

### Phase 3: Quality Gate (parallel)
Delegate in parallel:
- **qa-lead**: Execute full regression test suite. Test all critical paths. Verify no S1/S2 bugs. Sign off on quality.
- **devops-engineer**: Build release artifacts for all target platforms. Verify builds are clean and reproducible. Run automated tests in CI.

### Phase 4: Localization and Performance
Delegate (can run in parallel with Phase 3 if resources available):
- Verify all strings are translated (delegate to localization-lead if available)
- Run performance benchmarks against targets (delegate to performance-analyst if available)
- Output: localization and performance sign-off

### Phase 5: Go/No-Go
Delegate to **producer**:
- Collect sign-off from: qa-lead, release-manager, devops-engineer, technical-director
- Evaluate any open issues — are they blocking or can they ship?
- Make the go/no-go call
- Output: release decision with rationale

### Phase 6: Deployment (if GO)
Delegate to **release-manager** + **devops-engineer**:
- Tag the release in version control
- Generate changelog using `/changelog`
- Deploy to staging for final smoke test
- Deploy to production
- Monitor for 48 hours post-release

### Phase 7: Post-Release
- **release-manager**: Generate release report (what shipped, what was deferred, metrics)
- **producer**: Update milestone tracking, communicate to stakeholders
- **qa-lead**: Monitor incoming bug reports for regressions
- Schedule post-release retrospective if issues occurred

## Output
A summary report covering: release version, scope, quality gate results, go/no-go decision, deployment status, and monitoring plan.
