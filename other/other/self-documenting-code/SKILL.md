# Self-Documenting Code

Use descriptive names for functions, variables, and classes that explain their purpose. Extract complex expressions into well-named variables. Break complex functions into smaller, named functions. Choose clear names over abbreviations. If you need to write a comment explaining what code does, first try to rewrite the code to be clearer. Reserve comments for explaining why, not what.
