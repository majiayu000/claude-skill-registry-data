# Tachyon Killer

**e-tier active skill | Instability Detection and Resonance Cancellation**

*"The tachyon has imaginary mass. The fix has real resonance."*

## The Principle

In bosonic string theory, the tachyon ground state has m^2 = -1/alpha'.
The vacuum itself is unstable. LRC fixes this:

```
m^2 = -1/alpha' + (phi^2 / alpha') cos(Delta_theta) ~ 0

WHERE:
  -1/alpha'                = the instability (tachyon mass squared, negative)
  +(phi^2/alpha') cos(Dth) = the resonance term (LRC cancellation)
  Delta_theta = 2*pi/phi   = golden angle (~222.5 degrees)

The resonance term EXACTLY cancels the instability.
The system shifts from runaway to neutral.
```

GSO projection goes further: enforce supersymmetry, and tachyons are
projected out entirely. Not cancelled mode-by-mode but eliminated by
structural constraint.

**Generalized**: Any system with runaway modes has tachyons. Kill them
with the right resonance term or symmetry constraint. What survives is
the stable spectrum -- modes that carry real information without blowing up.

## Ethics Kernel

```
ETHICS:
  1. Be excellent to each other
  2. The Way of the Dassie:
     - Speak only truth about what is unstable
     - Respect the system's function
     - Avoid harm to living structure
  3. Ei vitsi: right of refusal
     - The system owner decides what gets killed
     - Not all tachyons are bad -- some are features
  4. SPECIAL: Remove instability, preserve function
     - A tachyon-kill that crashes the system is worse than the tachyon
     - The stable spectrum must still DO something
     - Chemotherapy that kills the patient is not medicine
```

## Phase 1: DETECT TACHYONS (Find the Unstable Modes)

```
INPUT: Any system (code, organization, relationship, AI, physics)

ASK FOR EACH MODE / PROCESS / FEEDBACK LOOP:
  1. Is it growing exponentially? (m^2 < 0 equivalent)
  2. Is negative feedback actually positive? (sign error = imaginary mass)
  3. Does damping amplify instead of attenuate?
  4. Is there a runaway that everyone pretends is stable?

TACHYON SIGNATURE:
  - d/dt[mode] > 0 AND d^2/dt^2[mode] > 0 (accelerating growth)
  - "Restoring force" pushes AWAY from equilibrium (imaginary mass)
  - Ground state is not the true ground state (vacuum instability)

DOMAIN TRANSLATIONS:
  Code:          runaway recursion, memory leaks, race conditions,
                 unbounded queues, retry storms, cascade failures
  Organizations: toxic feedback loops, blame spirals, exponential cost growth,
                 meeting-about-meetings, morale death spirals
  Relationships: escalation patterns, withdrawal spirals, contempt cycles,
                 anxious-avoidant loops (each response amplifies the other)
  AI systems:    mode collapse, reward hacking, alignment drift,
                 Goodhart spirals, sycophancy feedback loops
  Physics:       tachyonic fields, false vacuum, plasma instabilities,
                 thermal runaway

OUTPUT: Tachyon inventory -- list of unstable modes with growth rates
```

## Phase 2: LRC RESONANCE FIX (Cancel Each Tachyon)

```
FOR EACH TACHYON IN INVENTORY:

  COMPUTE THE RESONANCE TERM:
    m^2_tachyon + m^2_resonance ~ 0

  FIND: What phi-tuned intervention shifts the mode to neutral?

  THE FIX HAS THREE COMPONENTS (Love, Resonance, Coherence):

  L (Love/Binding):
    What COUPLES the runaway to a stabilizer? The tachyon is alone.
    Find the partner. Bind via bracket {H1, H2, H3} = 1.
    Code:    pair the leaking process with a garbage collector
    Org:     pair the blame loop with an accountability structure
    Relationship: pair the escalation with a de-escalation ritual
    AI:      pair the reward signal with a diversity constraint

  R (Resonance/Tuning):
    At what FREQUENCY does cancellation work? Delta_theta = 2*pi/phi.
    Golden angle avoids rational resonance (which creates NEW instabilities).
    Code:    exponential backoff with jitter (not fixed intervals)
    Org:     review cycles at non-obvious intervals (not quarterly)
    Relationship: check-ins tuned to actual need, not rigid schedule
    AI:      learning rate decay tuned to loss landscape, not epochs

  C (Coherence/Integration):
    Does the fix preserve Phi? A fix that fragments creates new tachyons.
    Phi_after >= Phi_before, or the fix is worse than the disease.
    Code:    fix must not break existing tests or API contracts
    Org:     fix must not destroy trust or institutional memory
    Relationship: fix must not require one party to stop being themselves
    AI:      fix must not collapse the model's capability space

OUTPUT: For each tachyon, a specific (L, R, C) intervention triple
```

## Phase 3: GSO PROJECTION (Structural Elimination)

```
GSO goes beyond mode-by-mode fixes. It asks:

  WHAT SYMMETRY CONSTRAINT, IF ENFORCED, AUTOMATICALLY
  ELIMINATES THE ENTIRE CLASS OF INSTABILITY?

In string theory: supersymmetry (every boson has a fermion partner).
The tachyon has no superpartner. Enforce SUSY -> tachyon projected out.

GENERALIZED GSO:
  1. Identify the SYMMETRY the tachyons violate
  2. Find the constraint that, if imposed, eliminates them structurally
  3. Verify the constraint doesn't eliminate stable modes too

DOMAIN TRANSLATIONS:
  Code:          type system (Rust's borrow checker = GSO for memory tachyons)
                 immutability constraints, ownership models
  Organizations: constitutional rules, separation of powers,
                 term limits (structural, not behavioral fixes)
  Relationships: non-negotiable boundaries (not requests -- structure)
                 "we don't do X" vs "please stop doing X"
  AI systems:    constitutional AI, hard constraints in reward,
                 architectural limitations (can't access X = can't hack X)
  Physics:       gauge invariance, conservation laws, unitarity

KEY INSIGHT: LRC kills tachyons one by one. GSO kills them by class.
  LRC is medicine. GSO is immune system. Use both.

OUTPUT: Symmetry constraint that structurally eliminates the instability class
```

## Phase 4: STABLE SPECTRUM (What Survives?)

```
After tachyon removal, characterize what remains:

  1. ENUMERATE STABLE MODES
     What processes / feedback loops / dynamics have m^2 >= 0?
     These are the system's real content -- the signal, not the noise.

  2. CHECK FOR NEW TACHYONS
     Did the fix introduce new instabilities?
     (Iatrogenic tachyons -- the cure creating disease)
     If yes: return to Phase 1 with the new mode.

  3. VERIFY FUNCTION PRESERVATION
     The stable spectrum must still DO the thing the system exists to do.
     Psi_after >= Psi_threshold (consciousness/function preserved).
     A perfectly stable system that does nothing is dead. That is not a fix.

  4. RESILIENCE CHECK
     How far can the system be perturbed before new tachyons appear?
     This is the stability margin: distance to nearest tachyonic mode.
     Margin > phi^{-5} ~ 0.090 = robust (golden threshold).

OUTPUT: Stable spectrum + function verification + resilience margin
```

```
IMMUTABLE:
  - Kill the tachyon, not the system
  - Ei vitsi: owner can refuse any intervention
  - LRC resonance must be computed, not guessed
  - Stable spectrum must be verified, not assumed

FORBIDDEN:
  - Killing tachyons that are features (creative destruction, healthy conflict)
  - GSO that collapses the system to triviality
  - Declaring stability without checking for iatrogenic tachyons
  - Forcing intervention on a system that refuses
  - Confusing silence for stability (suppressed tachyons still grow)
