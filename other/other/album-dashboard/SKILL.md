# Album Dashboard

You generate a comprehensive progress report for an album, showing completion percentage per workflow phase, blocking items, and a structured status breakdown.

---

## Workflow Phases

Track completion across these phases:

| Phase | Complete When |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. Concept | Album README has title, genre, tracklist defined |
| 2. Research | RESEARCH.md and SOURCES.md exist (if source-based) |
| 3. Source Verification | All tracks with sources have `sources_verified: Verified` or `N/A` |
| 4. Lyrics | All tracks have lyrics in their Lyrics Box |
| 5. Pronunciation | All pronunciation table entries applied in lyrics |
| 6. Review | Lyrics reviewed (no critical issues remain) |
| 7. Generation | All tracks have `has_suno_link: true` |
| 8. Mastering | Audio files exist in `{audio_root}/{artist}/{album}/` |
| 9. Release | Album status is "Released" |

---

## Data Collection

### From State Cache
Read `~/.bitwize-music/cache/state.json` and extract:
- Album status, track count, tracks completed
- Per-track: status, has_suno_link, sources_verified

### From Album Directory
Read the album README.md for:
- Whether tracklist is defined (vs template placeholder)
- Whether RESEARCH.md exists
- Whether SOURCES.md exists

Glob track files to check:
- Whether Lyrics Box has content
- Whether Pronunciation Notes table exists and has entries
- Whether Suno Inputs section has style prompt

## Phase Completion Calculation

### Concept Phase
- 100% if: Album README has title AND tracklist with actual track names (not template)
- 50% if: README exists but tracklist is template placeholder
- 0% if: No README

### Research Phase (source-based albums only)
- 100% if: RESEARCH.md AND SOURCES.md both exist with content
- 50% if: Only one exists
- N/A if: Album is not source-based (no tracks have sources_verified field or all are N/A)

### Source Verification Phase
- % = (tracks with Verified or N/A) / total tracks * 100
- Skip tracks where sources_verified is N/A for the denominator

### Lyrics Phase
- % = (tracks with lyrics content) / total tracks * 100

### Generation Phase
- % = (tracks with has_suno_link=true) / total tracks * 100

### Mastering Phase
- Check `{audio_root}/{artist}/{album}/` for WAV/FLAC files
- % = (audio files found) / total tracks * 100

### Release Phase
- 100% if album status is "Released", 0% otherwise

## Remember

1. **Visual progress bars** — Use ASCII progress bars for quick scanning
2. **Highlight blockers** — Blocking items are the most important info
3. **Include next action** — End with a clear recommendation
4. **Be accurate** — Count carefully, don't estimate
5. **Handle missing data gracefully** — If audio_root doesn't exist, mastering is 0%
