## Methodology Foundation

**Source:** Ann Handley - *Everybody Writes: Your Go-To Guide to Creating Ridiculously Good Content* (2014, 2nd edition 2022)

**Core Principle:** Writing isn't a gift—it's a skill. Writing well is part habit, part knowledge of fundamental rules, and part giving a damn about your reader.

> "No one will ever complain that you've made things too simple to understand."

## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

When invoked, I will guide you through the Everybody Writes methodology:

1. **Apply the Writing GPS** - 12-step framework from idea to published piece
2. **Write for the reader** - Develop "pathological empathy" for your audience
3. **Embrace the Ugly First Draft** - Separate creating from editing
4. **Edit ruthlessly** - Cut, clarify, and polish your work
5. **Adapt to specific formats** - Headlines, emails, social, long-form
6. **Build sustainable habits** - Consistent quality output

---

## How to Use

Provide information about your content writing challenge:

**Example prompts:**

- "Help me write a blog post about [topic]"
- "Improve this draft—make it clearer and more engaging"
- "Write email subject lines for our newsletter about [topic]"
- "Create social media posts promoting our new [product/content]"
- "I'm stuck on this piece—help me get unstuck"

**Information that helps:**

- Your target audience (who are you writing for?)
- The goal of the content (what action do you want?)
- The topic or subject matter
- Existing draft (if any) to improve
- Format/channel (blog, email, social, etc.)
- Tone/voice guidelines (if any)

---

## Instructions

### The Core Mindset: Writing for the Reader

Every piece of content must answer two questions:

1. **So what?** - Why does this matter?
2. **Who cares?** - Why should the reader care?

If you can't answer both, your content isn't ready.

**Develop "Pathological Empathy":**

| Ask Yourself | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| What does my reader already know? | Avoid boring them |
| What do they need to know? | Fill knowledge gaps |
| What do they want? | Align with desires |
| What do they fear? | Address objections |
| How can I help them? | Focus on value |

### Ann Handley's 13 Writing Rules

#### Foundation Rules

**1. There is no one way to write**
Find your process. What works for one writer won't work for another.

**2. Our words are our emissaries**
Your writing represents you. Every piece is a chance to build or break trust.

**3. Good writing is a power tool**
It's not optional—it's essential. Treat it as a professional skill.

**4. The key to better writing is more writing**
Practice is non-negotiable. Write regularly, not just when you "feel like it."

**5. Writing well is habit + knowledge + caring**
Know the rules. Practice consistently. Give a damn about your reader.

#### Clarity Rules

**6. No one complains about too-simple writing**
Simplicity is a gift. Never fear being too clear.

**7. Assume ignorance, not stupidity**
Explain without condescension. Your reader is smart but may not have context.

**8. Jargon is the chemical additives of writing**
It's artificial and hard to digest. Use plain language instead.

#### Process Rules

**9. The Ugly First Draft is necessary**
Don't skip the messy first attempt. It's how you get to good.

**10. Good writers are great editors**
The magic happens in revision, not the first draft.

**11. Editing is about clarity, not just grammar**
Cut what's unnecessary. Sharpen what's essential.

#### Discipline Rules

**12. You can't wait for inspiration**
Art that waits for the muse sits on the couch watching Netflix.

**13. Deadlines are the WD-40 of writing**
They keep things moving. Set them, even if self-imposed.

### The Writing GPS: 12-Step Framework

Use this framework for any significant piece of content:

#### Phase 1: Preparation

**Step 1: Goal**
What's the purpose? What action should readers take?

```
GOAL TEMPLATE:
After reading this, readers will [understand/do/feel] ___________
The primary CTA is: ___________
Success looks like: ___________
```

**Step 2: Reframe**
Put readers into the picture. Why do THEY care?

| Your Perspective | Reader's Perspective |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| "We launched a new feature" | "You can now do X faster" |
| "Our company won an award" | "We're committed to quality for you" |
| "Read our latest research" | "Here's how to solve [problem]" |

**Step 3: Seek Data**
Find facts, stats, examples, quotes, stories to support your point.

**Step 4: Organize**
Create a rough structure:
- What's your hook/lede?
- What are your 3-5 main points?
- What's your conclusion/CTA?

#### Phase 2: Creation

**Step 5: Write the Ugly First Draft (TUFD)**

> "Write with the door closed."

Rules for TUFD:
- Don't edit while writing
- Don't research mid-draft
- Don't worry about perfection
- Just get ideas down
- Embrace the mess

**Step 6: Walk Away**
Let it rest. An hour minimum, overnight if possible. Distance creates perspective.

#### Phase 3: Refinement

**Step 7: Rewrite**
Focus on big-picture issues:
- Is the structure logical?
- Does the argument flow?
- Is the lede strong enough?
- Does the ending land?

**Step 8: Edit for Clarity**
Cut ruthlessly. For every sentence:
- Is this necessary?
- Is this the simplest way to say it?
- Could this be shorter?

**Kill your darlings.** That clever phrase you love? If it doesn't serve the reader, cut it.

**Step 9: Edit for Grammar and Style**
Now worry about:
- Word choice
- Sentence variety
- Tone consistency
- Punctuation

#### Phase 4: Polish

**Step 10: Read Aloud**
Your ear catches what your eye misses:
- Awkward phrases
- Missing words
- Unnatural rhythm
- Overlong sentences

**Step 11: Get a Second Opinion**
Fresh eyes see what you can't. Ask someone to read for:
- Clarity
- Missing context
- Confusing passages
- Overall impression

**Step 12: Final Look**
One last polish, then PUBLISH. Don't let perfect be the enemy of done.

### Format-Specific Guidelines

#### Headlines

**Principles:**
- Promise something valuable
- Be specific (numbers, details)
- Create curiosity
- Front-load keywords

**Formula Options:**
| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| How to [achieve result] | "How to Write Headlines That Convert" |
| [Number] Ways to [benefit] | "7 Ways to Improve Your Email Open Rates" |
| The [adjective] Guide to [topic] | "The Complete Guide to Content Strategy" |
| [Question your audience asks] | "Why Isn't Your Content Converting?" |
| [Result] in [timeframe] | "Better Blog Posts in 30 Minutes" |

#### Leads/Opening Lines

**Types that Work:**
1. **Start with reader**: "You've spent hours on that blog post..."
2. **Provocative question**: "What if everything you know about SEO is wrong?"
3. **Surprising fact**: "72% of marketers say content is their biggest challenge"
4. **Brief story**: "Last week, a client asked me something that stopped me cold..."
5. **Straight to the point**: "Here's how to write content that converts."

**Avoid:**
- Starting with "We" or "Our company"
- Long-winded introductions
- Definitions ("Content marketing is...")
- Vague generalizations

#### Email Subject Lines

**Best Practices:**
- Clear beats clever (they need to know what's inside)
- Under 50 characters (for mobile)
- Create urgency (when genuine)
- Personalize when possible
- Test different approaches

**Formulas:**
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Curiosity | "This changed how I write forever" |
| Direct | "Your weekly content tips" |
| Question | "Struggling with headlines?" |
| How-to | "How to write faster (without sacrificing quality)" |
| Urgency | "Last day: Content workshop registration" |

#### Social Media Posts

**Principles:**
- Stop the scroll (first line matters most)
- Lead with the hook
- Offer value immediately
- Write like you talk
- Include clear CTAs

**Format for Long-Form (LinkedIn):**
```
[Hook: provocative statement or question]

[Space]

[Context: why this matters]

[Key insight or story]

[Takeaway or lesson]

[CTA or question for engagement]
```

### The Editing Checklist

Use this checklist before publishing:

**Big Picture:**
- [ ] Does the headline promise value?
- [ ] Does the lede hook the reader?

**Clarity:**
- [ ] Have I cut unnecessary words?

- [ ] Have I eliminated jargon?
- [ ] Would a 12-year-old understand this?

**Reader Focus:**

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Blog Post Rewrite

**Original Draft (Before):**

> "In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses are increasingly recognizing the importance of leveraging content marketing strategies to enhance their brand visibility and drive meaningful engagement with their target audiences. Our team has been working diligently to develop innovative approaches that can help companies navigate this complex terrain."

**Analysis:**
- Starts with "In today's" (cliché)
- Uses jargon: "leverage," "landscape," "enhance brand visibility"
- About the company, not the reader
- No clear point or value

**Rewritten (After):**

> "Your blog has been stuck at 500 monthly visitors for six months. You've published consistently. You've promoted on social. Nothing's working.
>
> Here's what we found when we analyzed 47 blogs that broke through that plateau—and the specific changes you can make this week."

**What Changed:**
- Starts with reader's problem
- Specific (500 visitors, six months, 47 blogs)
- Promises actionable value
- No jargon

---

### Example 2: Email Newsletter

**Assignment:** Write a newsletter introducing a new guide on email marketing.

**Using the Writing GPS:**

**Goal:** Get readers to download the guide
**Reader reframe:** They struggle with email—low open rates, low clicks, no results

**The Email:**

```
Subject: Your emails aren't the problem

Hey [Name],

I talked to 23 marketers last month about email.

Same frustration every time: "We write good emails. Why doesn't anyone engage?"

Here's what I've realized: the email itself usually isn't the problem.

The problem is what happens BEFORE the email:
- Sending to the wrong segment
- Sending at the wrong time
- Sending without a clear reason readers should care

We just published a guide that walks through the pre-email checklist
that doubled our own open rates.

It's 12 pages. No fluff. Takes 10 minutes to read.

→ Grab it here: [LINK]

If you implement even one thing from it, let me know what changes.

— Ann

P.S. Page 7 has the framework that made the biggest difference for us.
```

**Why It Works:**
- Hook creates curiosity (emails aren't the problem?)
- Specific data (23 marketers, doubled, 12 pages, 10 minutes)
- Reader-focused (your frustration, your improvement)
- Clear CTA with specificity
- P.S. creates additional curiosity
