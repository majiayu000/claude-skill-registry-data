name: backend-api
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles, HTTP standards, and resource-based URL conventions. Use this skill when creating or modifying API endpoints, routes, controllers, request handlers, or API documentation. Apply when working with REST API design, API versioning, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), URL structure, query parameters, response formatting, status codes, rate limiting, or API middleware. Use when building web services, microservices, or any backend code that exposes HTTP endpoints for client consumption.

# Backend API

## When to use this skill

- When creating new API endpoints or routes in your backend application
- When modifying existing API controllers, request handlers, or route definitions
- When implementing RESTful resource endpoints (e.g., /users, /products, /orders)
- When designing URL structures and API versioning strategies
- When working with HTTP methods and status code handling
- When implementing query parameter handling for filtering, sorting, or pagination
- When building API middleware for authentication, rate limiting, or request validation
- When writing API documentation or OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- When refactoring API structure to improve consistency or follow REST principles
- When implementing nested resource endpoints or complex API relationships
- When adding rate limiting headers or API usage tracking
- When working on microservices or web service integration points

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.
