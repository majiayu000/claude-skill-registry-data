# Kaizen: Continuous Improvement

## Overview

Small improvements, continuously. Error-proof by design. Follow what works. Build only what's needed.

**Core principle:** Many small improvements beat one big change. Prevent errors at design time, not with fixes.

## When to Use

**Always applied for:**

- Code implementation and refactoring
- Architecture and design decisions
- Process and workflow improvements
- Error handling and validation

**Philosophy:** Quality through incremental progress and prevention, not perfection through massive effort.
