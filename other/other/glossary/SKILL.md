description: How to add entries to the glossary
---

The [glossary](../../docs/glossary.md) explains terms with specific meanings in this
project. When a new term is introduced—or an old term without a glossary entry discovered—
consider adding the term to the glossary.

When doing so:

- Include links to relevant implementation files using `[term](../path/to/file.ts)` syntax
- Use cross-references with `[term](#term)` syntax to link related concepts
- Consider how new terms relate to existing architectural concepts
