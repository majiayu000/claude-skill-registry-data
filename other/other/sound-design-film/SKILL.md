# Sound Design (Murch Method)

> Apply Walter Murch's legendary film sound principles to marketing video, creating emotionally resonant audio that audiences feel without consciously noticing.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing sound for brand films and documentaries
- Creating emotional impact in video ads
- Layering music, effects, and voice effectively
- Building immersive soundscapes for content
- Elevating production value through audio
- Understanding why certain videos "feel" professional

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: Walter Murch - Sound Designer, 3x Oscar Winner (Apocalypse Now, The English Patient)

**Core Principle**: "Sound is a passport-free traveler—it sneaks under the radar and creates emotional effects that audiences attribute to the visuals." Great sound design is invisible; viewers feel it but don't consciously notice it. The goal is emotional truth, not technical perfection.

**Why This Matters**: Most marketers focus 90% on visuals and 10% on audio, when audio carries 50% of the emotional impact. Murch's principles, developed over 50+ years of filmmaking, transform ordinary video into compelling experiences.


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Prioritizes sound elements** - The correct hierarchy: dialogue → story sounds → music → effects → foley
2. **Applies the Law of Two and a Half** - Strategic layering for maximum impact
3. **Creates authentic space** - Worldizing technique for believable environments
4. **Designs emotional arcs** - Sound that supports narrative without calling attention to itself
5. **Balances clarity and richness** - Clean enough to understand, complex enough to feel real

## How to Use

### Design Sound for Video
```
Help me design the sound approach for this video:
[describe video content]
Emotional goal: [what should viewers feel]
Current audio: [what you have]
```

### Review Sound Mix
```
Review this sound design approach and suggest improvements:
[describe current audio layers]
Issues I'm noticing: [problems]
```

### Create Sound Brief
```
Create a sound design brief for my video editor/sound designer:
Video: [describe]
Brand: [tone/personality]
References: [similar work]
```

## Instructions

When applying Murch's principles, follow this methodology:

### Step 1: Establish the Sound Hierarchy

Murch's priority order for mixing—lower numbers take precedence.

```
## The Murch Hierarchy

1. DIALOGUE
   The spine of the piece. Everything else supports this.
   "If you can't hear what they're saying, nothing else matters."

2. KEY STORY SOUNDS
   The sounds essential to narrative comprehension.
   Examples: Phone ringing that starts the scene, door slam that ends it

3. MUSIC
   Emotional foundation and pacing.
   Supports but never competes with dialogue.

4. EFFECTS
   Environmental sounds, action sounds, transitions.
   Creates context and reality.

5. FOLEY
   Subtle human sounds: footsteps, clothing rustle, object handling.
   Adds life and presence.

---

Rule: Each layer yields to those above it.
Music ducks when dialogue begins.
Effects clear space for key story sounds.
```

---

### Step 2: Apply the Law of Two and a Half

Murch's principle for complexity in sound layering.

```
## The Law of Two and a Half

"Beyond three similar sounds playing simultaneously,
something chemical happens—the brain stops tracking
individual elements and perceives a new, unified sensation."

### How to Use It

**For Realism**: Layer 3+ similar sounds
- City ambience: traffic + distant horns + pedestrians + AC hum
- Result: Feels like a real city, not "sound effects"

**For Clarity**: Stay under 3 elements
- Dialogue scene: voice + subtle music + room tone
- Result: Clear, focused, intelligible

**For Impact**: Cross the threshold intentionally
- Climax moment: Layer multiple hits, impacts, swells
- Result: Overwhelming sensation (use sparingly)

### Practical Application

| Scene Type | Recommended Layers | Example |
|------------|-------------------|---------|
| Dialogue-heavy | 2-3 | Voice, music bed, light ambience |
| Emotional peak | 4-6 | Voice, score, effects, foley, room |
| Transition | 1-2 | Music, light effects |
| Action | 4+ | Multiple effects, hits, music |
```

---

### Step 3: Use Worldizing

Murch's technique for authentic acoustic space.

```
## Worldizing Technique

**What It Is**:
Play recorded audio through speakers in a real space,
re-record it with microphones to capture the room's acoustic character.

**Why It Works**:
Stock music and studio recordings sound "too perfect."
Worldizing adds the imperfections that make audio feel real and present.

### DIY Worldizing for Marketers

**Option 1: Physical Worldizing**
1. Play your music/VO through a speaker in the space you're depicting
2. Record with a microphone capturing room reflections
3. Blend with original for desired effect
4. Example: Music playing from a "radio" in scene

**Option 2: Digital Worldizing**
1. Use convolution reverb with impulse responses of real spaces
2. Apply room simulation plugins
3. Add subtle distortion/EQ to simulate speaker playback
4. Roll off highs and lows to simulate distance

**Option 3: Practical Recording**
1. Record actual room tone in your location
2. Layer beneath all other audio
3. This single element dramatically increases perceived realism

### When to Use

✓ Music that's "source" (playing in the world, not underscore)
✓ Flashback sequences
✓ Documentary-style content
✓ "Behind the scenes" feeling
✓ Any time you want audio to feel "there" vs. "added"
```

### Step 4: Design Emotional Arcs

Sound should support the story's emotional journey.

```
## Sound-Emotion Mapping

### Build Your Arc

1. **Identify Key Emotional Beats**
   - What should viewer feel at 0:00? 0:30? 1:00? End?
   - Map the emotional journey

2. **Assign Sound Strategies to Each Beat**

   | Emotion | Sound Strategy |
   |---------|---------------|
   | Tension | Sustained tones, rising pitch, reduced elements |
   | Release | Musical resolution, fuller spectrum, exhale sounds |
   | Intimacy | Close mic perspective, reduced ambience, whisper range |
   | Power | Low end emphasis, layered impacts, space/reverb |
   | Joy | Bright frequencies, uptempo, organic sounds |
   | Melancholy | Minor keys, sparse arrangement, room tone |
   | Urgency | Fast pacing, compressed dynamics, clipping/distortion |

3. **Create Transitions**
   - Sound bridges between emotional states
   - Pre-lap audio (sound starts before visual cut)
   - Post-lap audio (sound continues after visual cut)

### Example: 60-Second Brand Film Arc

0:00-0:15: PROBLEM (Tension)
- Minimal music, discordant undertones
- Harsh office sounds, fluorescent hum
- Tight, dry vocal treatment

0:15-0:35: DISCOVERY (Curiosity → Hope)
- Music enters subtly, builds
- Sound design softens
- More space in mix

0:35-0:55: SOLUTION (Confidence)
- Full musical support
- Warm, rich sound design
- Open, confident vocal treatment

0:55-1:00: RESOLUTION (Satisfaction)
- Music resolves
- Key brand sound/sonic logo
- Comfortable silence
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Brand Documentary Sound Design

**Context**: Creating a 3-minute brand film about a coffee company's sourcing journey.

**Input**:
> Help me design the sound approach for a 3-minute documentary about our coffee sourcing. We follow beans from Colombian farms to the final cup. Goal: viewers should feel the care and craft that goes into every cup.

**Output**:

## Sound Design Approach: Coffee Journey Documentary

### Emotional Arc

| Timestamp | Scene | Emotion | Sound Strategy |
|-----------|-------|---------|----------------|
| 0:00-0:30 | Farm morning | Wonder, possibility | Nature ambience, no music, world awakening |
| 0:30-1:15 | Harvesting | Craft, rhythm | Rhythmic work sounds, subtle Latin guitar |
| 1:15-1:45 | Processing | Transformation | Industrial + organic blend, building music |
| 1:45-2:30 | Journey/roasting | Anticipation | Travel sounds, roaster warmth, crescendo |
| 2:30-3:00 | Final cup | Satisfaction | Resolution, intimate, human connection |

### Sound Hierarchy (This Project)

1. **Environment/Ambience** (unusual—visuals carry story, sound creates place)
2. **Key Story Sounds** (coffee beans, machines, pour)
3. **Music** (supportive, never leading)
4. **Voice** (if any—keep minimal)

### Layer-by-Layer Design

**ACT 1: The Farm (0:00-1:15)**

*Ambience (always present)*:
- Dawn birds, Colombia-specific species (research exact sounds)
- Mountain atmosphere, thin air, distance
- Subtle livestock in background
- Wind through coffee plants (distinctive rustling)

*Key Story Sounds*:
- Handpicking sounds: leaf movement, bean snap, basket drop
- Footsteps on soil (worldize these—record on actual dirt)
- Human breath during work (close mic for intimacy)

*Music*:
- First 30 seconds: NO music. Let nature speak.
- 0:30: Introduce single acoustic guitar, traditional Colombian feel
- Simple, repetitive pattern matching work rhythm

---

**ACT 2: Processing (1:15-1:45)**

*Transition*: Water sound (washing beans) bridges farm to facility

*Ambience*:
- Water processing sounds (washing, flowing)
- Machinery hum (light industrial)
- Wooden drying beds (beans rolling, rakes)

*Key Story Sounds*:
- Bean pile movement (ASMR quality—microphone close)
- Sorting sounds (hands moving through beans)
- Quality check sounds (beans dropping, examining)

*Music*:
- Slightly fuller arrangement
- Add subtle percussion matching machinery rhythms
- Maintain organic feel despite industrial setting

---

**ACT 3: Journey & Roasting (1:45-2:30)**

*Transition*: Vehicle sounds, movement, time passing

*Ambience*:
- Roastery atmosphere: warmth, activity
- Coffee roasting (the crackling "first crack" is gold)
- Steam, machine cycles

*Key Story Sounds*:
- Bean transformation sounds (cracking, expansion)
- Roaster drum rotation
- Timer/bell sounds
- Bag filling, sealing

*Music*:
- Building to emotional peak
- Fuller instrumentation
- Tempo increases slightly with anticipation

---

**ACT 4: The Cup (2:30-3:00)**

*Transition*: Music softens, focus narrows

*Ambience*:
- Quiet café or home environment
- Clock ticking (time slowing down)
- Soft room tone

*Key Story Sounds*:
- Grinding (close mic, ASMR quality)
- Water pouring
- First sip (subtle, not gross)
- Cup setting down

*Music*:
- Resolves to simple, warm conclusion
- Maybe returns to single guitar from opening
- Natural fade, not abrupt end

### Production Notes

**Worldizing Requirements**:
- All farm ambience should feel "outdoor close" not "stock library"
- Roastery sounds should have that warm, slightly compressed industrial character
- Final café should feel intimate, close perspective

**Critical Sound Moments**:
- 0:45: First close-up of hands picking—this needs ASMR quality
- 1:35: First crack of roasting beans—record real, don't fake
- 2:50: Pouring the cup—the sound of liquid matters enormously

---

### Example 2: Product Launch Video Sound

**Context**: 45-second tech product reveal video.

**Input**:
> I'm creating a 45-second product reveal for a new smartphone. Sleek, premium, innovative. How should the sound support this?

**Output**:

## Sound Design: Smartphone Reveal

### Key Sound Principles for Tech Reveals

**1. Precision Over Complexity**
- Tech products = clean, intentional sounds
- Each sound element should feel designed, not accidental
- Less is more; silence is powerful

**2. Materiality Matters**
- Sound should convey product materials (glass, aluminum, ceramic)
- Premium = resonant, clear, controlled
- Cheap = hollow, thin, rattly

**3. Sync is Everything**
- Every visual gesture needs exact audio response
- Precision communicates quality
- Off-sync = amateur

### Sound Breakdown

**0:00-0:05: Darkness/Anticipation**
- Deep bass swell (subsonic, felt not heard)
- Single high frequency "spark" at 0:04
- Tension through restraint

**0:05-0:15: First Reveal**
- Product appears: Custom designed "emergence" sound
  - Glass resonance tone
  - Subtle mechanical precision click
  - Brief harmonic sustain
- Music: Minimal electronic pulse begins
- Space: Large reverb, premium positioning

**0:15-0:30: Feature Showcase**
- Each feature reveal gets custom sound:
  - Screen: Glass surface tap + interface woosh
  - Camera: Mechanical lens sound (designed)
  - Speed: Rapid data sounds, crisp and quick
- Music: Building, but never overwhelming visuals
- Transitions: Designed whooshes, never stock

**0:30-0:40: Hero Moment**
- Full product beauty shot
- Music reaches peak but stays controlled
- Product interaction sounds (subtle touch, rotation)
- Space becomes intimate (closer perspective)

**0:40-0:45: Logo/End**
- Music resolves cleanly
- Sonic logo or brand sound
- Clean tail, not abrupt cut
- Silence is the final statement

### Sound Design Specifications

**Custom Sounds Needed**:
1. Product appearance sound (2-3 versions to test)
2. Screen interaction (tap, swipe, response)
3. Camera activation
4. Hardware button (premium click, not clacky)
5. Transition wooshes (3 variations)
6. Sonic logo sting

**Music Guidance**:
- Style: Minimal electronic, Scandinavian clean aesthetic
- Tempo: 90-100 BPM (controlled, confident)
- No obvious drops or builds; subtle dynamics
- Reference: Apple keynote music energy, not EDM

**Technical**:
- Deliver -14 LUFS for web
- Preserve dynamic range (don't over-compress)
- Ensure clean playback on phone speakers
