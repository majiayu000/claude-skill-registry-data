# AI Tells

Patterns to avoid in all written content. Read the examples in `references/` for voice - don't follow rules mechanically.

## The One Rule

**Never use the correlative construction.** This is the #1 AI tell:
- "X isn't just Y - it's Z"
- "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- "Schools aren't just buildings - they're communities"

Find another way. State the thing directly.

## Other Patterns to Avoid

1. **Setup phrases:** "The best part? ..." / "The secret? ..." / "Here's the thing..."
2. **Staccato fragments:** "No fluff. No filler. Just results."
3. **Triple adjectives:** "Fast, efficient, reliable" (grouping in threes)
4. **Cliché openers:** "In today's fast-paced..." / "In the ever-evolving..."
5. **Dramatic punctuation:** "Let that sink in" / "Now more than ever"
6. **Thesaurus abuse:** utilize, implement, facilitate, leverage, comprehensive, crucial
7. **Fake questions:** "Sound familiar?" / "Ready to level up?"
8. **Transition tells:** "And here's the kicker" / "Enter: [thing]"

## Format Constraints

- **Dashes:** hyphens with spaces - like this - not em dashes (—)
- **No emojis** in body content
- **No bold** for emphasis within paragraphs

## Voice References

Read these for the vibe, not as rules:
- `references/pirate-wires-examples.md` - 11 annotated examples showing voice in action
- `references/pirate-wires-style.md` - Voice breakdown

**The test:** Does this sound like a person talking, or a person performing "good writing"?
