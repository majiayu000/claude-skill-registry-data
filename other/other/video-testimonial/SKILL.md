# Video Testimonial Collection

> Capture authentic customer testimonials through guided self-recording workflows, from outreach and briefing to recording and publishing.

## When to Use This Skill

- Building social proof for marketing campaigns
- Creating customer success stories
- Gathering testimonials for website and ads
- Producing case study videos
- Collecting user-generated content
- Scaling testimonial collection without professional video crews

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: Vocal Video + Video Testimonial Best Practices

**Core Principle**: "Video testimonials combine two of the most powerful marketing forces online—social proof and video." Over 70% of viewers say positive video testimonials significantly increase their trust in a business. The key is making recording easy for customers while guiding them to share compelling, authentic stories.

**Why This Matters**: Written testimonials lack emotional impact. Professional video testimonials are expensive and logistically complex. Self-recorded testimonials—with proper guidance—deliver authenticity at scale. Customers recording on their phones often produces more genuine, relatable content than polished productions.

Volume goal: [how many testimonials]
```

Platform: [email/call/in-person]
```

```

## Instructions

When collecting video testimonials, follow this methodology:

### Step 1: Identify the Right Customers

Not every customer makes a great testimonial. Find the right ones.

```
## Testimonial Candidate Criteria

### Ideal Candidates

**High-Value Indicators**:
- Recently achieved significant result
- Expressed enthusiasm unsolicited
- Has been with you long enough to have real experience
- Represents your ideal customer profile
- Articulate and comfortable on camera
- Has specific, quantifiable outcomes

**Perfect Timing**:
- Just completed onboarding successfully
- Just hit a milestone or achieved a goal
- Just renewed or upgraded
- Just referred someone else
- Just gave you a 5-star review

### Who to Avoid

**Red Flags**:
- Currently has unresolved support issues
- Passive/unenthusiastic relationship
- Uses you but wouldn't recommend
- Hard to reach or unresponsive
- Competitive concerns about appearing
- Legal/compliance restrictions

### Finding Candidates

**Proactive Sources**:
- NPS 9-10 respondents
- Support tickets marked "Positive outcome"
- Social media mentions
- Referral sources
- Long-term renewals
- Case study interview volunteers

**Ask Customer Success Team**:
- "Who's had a big win recently?"
- "Who's been really vocal about loving us?"
- "Who would you feel confident asking?"
```

---

### Step 2: Make the Ask

Request testimonials in a way that gets yes responses.

```
## Testimonial Request Best Practices

### Timing

**Best time to ask**: "Should be asked verbally before the job is started so that the customer is at ease" OR immediately after a positive outcome.

**Ask early, deliver later**: Plant the seed when relationship is new, request fulfillment after they have results to share.

### Request Principles

**Make it easy**:
- Clear, simple process
- Minimal time commitment (under 5 minutes)
- No technical barriers

**Show value**:
- How their story helps others
- What's in it for them (exposure, reciprocity)
- That you genuinely value their perspective

**Remove friction**:
- Provide questions in advance
- Offer multiple recording options
- Handle editing and production

### What NOT to Do

- Don't offer excessive incentives (appears bought)
- Don't request specific wording (appears scripted)
- Don't ask customers with unresolved issues
- Don't make it feel like homework
- Don't skip getting proper consent

### Request Templates

**Email Request**:

Subject: Would you share your experience? (2 minutes)

Hi [Name],

I noticed you recently [achieved result / mentioned liking X]. That made my day!

Would you be willing to share your experience in a quick video testimonial? Just 60-90 seconds on your phone.

I'll send you 3 simple questions to answer—nothing scripted, just your honest perspective.

Your story could help others [benefit] and we'd feature you on [where].

If you're open to it, just reply "yes" and I'll send everything you need.

Thanks for being such a great customer!
