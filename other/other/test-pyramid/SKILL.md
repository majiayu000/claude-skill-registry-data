# Test Pyramid

Build a solid foundation of fast, isolated unit tests that cover individual functions and classes. Add integration tests that verify components work together correctly (API endpoints, database queries). Use E2E tests sparingly for critical user journeys. Unit tests catch most bugs quickly; integration tests find interface issues; E2E tests validate real user scenarios.
