user-invocable: true

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Read the argument** for the target level or area (e.g., `tutorial`,
   `forest dungeon`, `hub town`, `final boss arena`).

2. **Gather context**:
   - Read the game concept at `design/gdd/game-concept.md`
   - Read game pillars at `design/gdd/game-pillars.md`
   - Read existing level docs in `design/levels/`
   - Read relevant narrative docs in `design/narrative/`
   - Read world-building docs for the area's region/faction

## How to Delegate

Use the Task tool to spawn each team member as a subagent:
- `subagent_type: narrative-director` — Narrative purpose, characters, emotional arc
- `subagent_type: world-builder` — Lore context, environmental storytelling, world rules
- `subagent_type: level-designer` — Spatial layout, pacing, encounters, navigation
- `subagent_type: systems-designer` — Enemy compositions, loot tables, difficulty balance
- `subagent_type: art-director` — Visual theme, color palette, lighting, asset requirements
- `subagent_type: qa-tester` — Test cases, boundary testing, playtest checklist

Always provide full context in each agent's prompt (game concept, pillars, existing level docs, narrative docs).

3. **Orchestrate the level design team** in sequence:

### Step 1: Narrative Context (narrative-director + world-builder)
Spawn the `narrative-director` agent to:
- Define the narrative purpose of this area (what story beats happen here?)
- Identify key characters, dialogue triggers, and lore elements
- Specify emotional arc (how should the player feel entering, during, leaving?)

Spawn the `world-builder` agent to:
- Provide lore context for the area (history, faction presence, ecology)
- Define environmental storytelling opportunities
- Specify any world rules that affect gameplay in this area

### Step 2: Layout and Encounter Design (level-designer)
Spawn the `level-designer` agent to:
- Design the spatial layout (critical path, optional paths, secrets)
- Define pacing curve (tension peaks, rest areas, exploration zones)
- Place encounters with difficulty progression
- Design environmental puzzles or navigation challenges
- Define points of interest and landmarks for wayfinding
- Specify entry/exit points and connections to adjacent areas

### Step 3: Systems Integration (systems-designer)
Spawn the `systems-designer` agent to:
- Specify enemy compositions and encounter formulas
- Define loot tables and reward placement
- Balance difficulty relative to expected player level/gear
- Design any area-specific mechanics or environmental hazards
- Specify resource distribution (health pickups, save points, shops)

### Step 4: Visual Direction (art-director)
Spawn the `art-director` agent to:
- Define the visual theme and color palette for the area
- Specify lighting mood and time-of-day settings
- List required art assets (environment props, unique assets)
- Define visual landmarks and sight lines
- Specify any special VFX needs (weather, particles, fog)

### Step 5: QA Planning (qa-tester)
Spawn the `qa-tester` agent to:
- Write test cases for the critical path
- Identify boundary and edge cases (sequence breaks, softlocks)
- Create a playtest checklist for the area
- Define acceptance criteria for level completion

4. **Compile the level design document** combining all team outputs into the
   level design template format.

5. **Save to** `design/levels/[level-name].md`.

6. **Output a summary** with: area overview, encounter count, estimated asset
   list, narrative beats, and any cross-team dependencies or open questions.
