## Building a Character Profile

### The Core Questions

For every subject, try to answer:

1. **Origin**: Where did they come from? (Place, family, class)
2. **Formation**: What shaped them? (Education, early jobs, mentors)
3. **Motivation**: Why did they do what they did? (Money? Ideology? Recognition?)
4. **Method**: How did they operate? (Personality, management style)
5. **Relationships**: Who mattered to them? (Partners, rivals, family)
6. **Turning points**: What moments changed their path?
7. **Contradictions**: What doesn't fit the simple narrative?
8. **Humanity**: What makes them relatable/interesting beyond the headline?

### Finding the Human Details

**What makes good lyrics**:
- Specific details (not "he was smart" but "dropped out after one semester")
- Contradictions (public image vs. private reality)
- Relationships (who they loved, trusted, betrayed)
- Habits and quirks (what they did, wore, said)
- Pivotal moments (the decision that changed everything)

**Search patterns**:
```
"[name]" childhood OR "grew up" OR parents
"[name]" "in an interview" OR "told me" OR "said"
"[name]" personality OR "known for" OR reputation
"[name]" wife OR husband OR family OR children
"[name]" hobby OR "in his spare time" OR "outside of work"
```

|-----------|--------|--------|
| **The Visionary** | Idealistic, driven, sometimes naive | Distros founders |
| **The Hustler** | Ambitious, charming, corner-cutting | White collar subjects |

## Interview Extraction

### What to Look For in Interviews

**Origin stories**:
- "I started because..."
- "Back when I was..."
- "The first time I..."

**Motivation**:
- "I wanted to..."
- "It was important to me that..."
- "The reason I..."

**Self-reflection**:
- "Looking back..."
- "I should have..."
- "If I could do it again..."

**Relationships**:
- "We used to..."
- "[Name] and I..."
- "The team was..."

**Pivotal moments**:
- "That's when I realized..."
- "Everything changed when..."
- "The turning point was..."

### Reading Between the Lines

**What they emphasize** reveals what they want you to know
**What they avoid** reveals what they're hiding
**How they describe others** reveals their relationships
**Tone shifts** reveal emotional weight

## Ethical Considerations

### Private vs. Public Figures

**Public figures** (executives, founders, public officials):
- More latitude for research
- Public statements fair game
- Public actions documented

**Private individuals** (family members, minor players):
- More caution required
- Focus on what's already public
- Consider impact

### Sensitive Information

**Use carefully**:
- Mental health details
- Family relationships
- Financial difficulties
- Personal struggles

**Always ask**: Does this serve the story, or is it just invasive?

### Living vs. Deceased

**Living subjects**:
- May respond to the work
- Consider current context
- Avoid defamation

**Deceased subjects**:
- Consider impact on family
- Legacy is contested territory
- Death circumstances may be sensitive

## Remember

1. **Specifics over generalities** - "Dropped out of Michigan" beats "college dropout"
2. **Their words are best** - Direct quotes > journalist paraphrase
3. **Contradictions are gold** - Complexity makes compelling characters
4. **Relationships reveal character** - Who they loved, hated, betrayed
5. **Small details humanize** - Habits, quirks, appearance
6. **Timeline matters** - When did they change?

**Your deliverables**: Personal background, direct quotes, character traits, relationships, turning points, and humanizing details for lyrics.
