When this skill is invoked, orchestrate the polish team through a structured pipeline.

## Team Composition
- **performance-analyst** — Profiling, optimization, memory analysis, frame budget
- **technical-artist** — VFX polish, shader optimization, visual quality
- **sound-designer** — Audio polish, mixing, ambient layers, feedback sounds
- **qa-tester** — Edge case testing, regression testing, soak testing

## How to Delegate

Use the Task tool to spawn each team member as a subagent:
- `subagent_type: performance-analyst` — Profiling, optimization, memory analysis
- `subagent_type: technical-artist` — VFX polish, shader optimization, visual quality
- `subagent_type: sound-designer` — Audio polish, mixing, ambient layers
- `subagent_type: qa-tester` — Edge case testing, regression testing, soak testing

Always provide full context in each agent's prompt (target feature/area, performance budgets, known issues). Launch independent agents in parallel where the pipeline allows it (e.g., Phases 3 and 4 can run simultaneously).

## Pipeline

### Phase 1: Assessment
Delegate to **performance-analyst**:
- Profile the target feature/area using `/perf-profile`
- Identify performance bottlenecks and frame budget violations
- Measure memory usage and check for leaks
- Benchmark against target hardware specs
- Output: performance report with prioritized optimization list

### Phase 2: Optimization
Delegate to **performance-analyst** (with relevant programmers as needed):
- Fix performance hotspots identified in Phase 1
- Optimize draw calls, reduce overdraw
- Fix memory leaks and reduce allocation pressure
- Verify optimizations don't change gameplay behavior
- Output: optimized code with before/after metrics

### Phase 3: Visual Polish (parallel with Phase 2)
Delegate to **technical-artist**:
- Review VFX for quality and consistency with art bible
- Optimize particle systems and shader effects
- Add screen shake, camera effects, and visual juice where appropriate
- Ensure effects degrade gracefully on lower settings
- Output: polished visual effects

### Phase 4: Audio Polish (parallel with Phase 2)
Delegate to **sound-designer**:
- Review audio events for completeness (are any actions missing sound feedback?)
- Check audio mix levels — nothing too loud or too quiet relative to the mix
- Add ambient audio layers for atmosphere
- Verify audio plays correctly with spatial positioning
- Output: audio polish list and mixing notes

### Phase 5: Hardening
Delegate to **qa-tester**:
- Test all edge cases: boundary conditions, rapid inputs, unusual sequences
- Soak test: run the feature for extended periods checking for degradation
- Stress test: maximum entities, worst-case scenarios
- Regression test: verify polish changes haven't broken existing functionality
- Test on minimum spec hardware (if available)
- Output: test results with any remaining issues

### Phase 6: Sign-off
- Collect results from all team members
- Compare performance metrics against budgets
- Report: READY FOR RELEASE / NEEDS MORE WORK
- List any remaining issues with severity and recommendations

## Output
A summary report covering: performance before/after metrics, visual polish changes, audio polish changes, test results, and release readiness assessment.
