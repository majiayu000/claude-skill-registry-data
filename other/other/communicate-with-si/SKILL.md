## Who is the Si?

Si types are supportive, patient, and exceptionally perceptive. They combine the steady warmth of the S style with the social awareness of I, making them natural counselors and nurturers. What matters most to them is building deep, trusting relationships where people feel safe to be vulnerable. They communicate with genuine care and make decisions thoughtfully, always considering the human impact first.

## Do's

- Take time to connect personally before getting into business.
- Use a warm, sincere tone that shows you value the relationship.
- Express genuine appreciation for their contributions regularly.
- Give them adequate time to process before expecting a response.
- Acknowledge their feelings and perspective before sharing your own.
- Create relaxed, non-threatening atmospheres for conversation.
- Show that you value collaboration and teamwork.
- Be patient and let them open up at their own pace.

## Don'ts

- Don't be harsh, demanding, or dismissive in tone.
- Don't rush them into quick decisions or immediate responses.
- Don't dismiss the emotional dimension of situations.
- Don't create competitive or win-lose dynamics.

- Don't ignore their perspective just because they express it softly.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Create a relaxed, non-threatening atmosphere. Give Si types time to process before asking for input, and value their insights on team dynamics and morale. Avoid putting them on the spot unexpectedly or rushing through agenda items. They contribute best when they feel safe.

### Email
Use a warm, personal tone and express genuine appreciation for their contributions. Give them adequate time to respond, and avoid harsh or demanding language. A brief personal note at the start helps them feel valued and sets the right tone for the rest of the message.

### Giving Feedback
Choose a private, comfortable setting for feedback conversations. Lead with genuine appreciation before addressing growth areas. Be gentle but clear, and offer support and resources for improvement rather than just criticism. They take feedback to heart, so deliver it with care.

### Resolving Conflict
Approach conflicts calmly and privately, acknowledging their feelings and perspective first. Focus on solutions rather than blame, and allow them time to process emotions before expecting resolution. Si types need to feel emotionally safe before they can engage constructively with disagreement.
