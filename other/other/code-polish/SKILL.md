# Code Polish

Combined simplification and review pipeline. This skill orchestrates two sub-skills in sequence:

1. **`code-simplify`** — simplify for readability and maintainability
2. **`code-review --fix`** — review for correctness, security, and quality, auto-applying all fixes

## Workflow

### 1) Run `code-simplify`

Invoke the `code-simplify` skill, forwarding `$ARGUMENTS` as-is.

### 2) Run `code-review --fix`

Invoke the `code-review` skill with the `--fix` flag appended to `$ARGUMENTS`.

### 3) Report

Combine the outputs from both skills into a single summary:

1. **Scope**: Files and functions touched.
2. **Simplifications**: Key changes from `code-simplify`.
3. **Review findings and fixes**: Findings and applied fixes from `code-review`.
4. **Verification**: Commands run and outcomes.
5. **Residual risks**: Assumptions or items needing manual review.
