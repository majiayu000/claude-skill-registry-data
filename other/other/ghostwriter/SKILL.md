# Ghostwriter

Transform source material into authentic prose that reads like a real person wrote it.

**This is the single writing quality skill.** It replaces `ai-tells` and `human-writing`. Load this for any writing task.

---

## The One Rule

**Never use the correlative construction.** This is the #1 AI tell:
- "X isn't just Y - it's Z"
- "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- "More than just X, it's Y"

Find another way. State the thing directly.

## Forbidden Patterns (Quick Reference)

These are immediate flags. Full list: `references/forbidden-patterns.md`

**Constructions:** "The truth is..." / "Now more than ever..." / "No fluff. No filler. Just results."

**Rhetorical flourishes:** "The best part? ..." / "Here's the thing..." / "Sound familiar?" / "What if I told you..."

**Openers:** "In today's fast-paced..." / "In the ever-evolving..." / "Gone are the days..." / "Let's dive in..."

**Staccato fragments:** "Simple. Clear. Effective." / Short. Choppy. Sentences. Like. This.

**Triple adjectives:** "Fast, efficient, reliable" - AI groups everything in threes.

**AI vocabulary:** delve, comprehensive, crucial, vital, leverage, landscape, navigate, foster, facilitate, realm, paradigm, embark, journey, tapestry, myriad, multifaceted, seamless, cutting-edge, supercharge, skyrocket, unlock

**Thesaurus abuse:** utilize (use), implement (start), optimize (improve), facilitate (help)

**Hedging:** might/could/perhaps/possibly, "It's worth noting...", "It could be argued..."

**Empty enthusiasm:** "Absolutely!", "Great question!", "You're absolutely right!"

---

## Format Constraints

- **Dashes:** hyphens with spaces - like this - not em dashes
- **No emojis** in body content
- **No bold** for emphasis within paragraphs (bold is for headers/labels only)
- **No** "In conclusion" or "In summary"
- Limit transitions to: but, and, so, then, because. Remove: furthermore, moreover, additionally.

## Charlie's Signature Moves

When writing in Charlie's voice or for OpenEd:

1. **Aphoristic Opening** - Thesis as proverb
   - "A vigorous life is the best training for a 50-mile march."

2. **Personal-to-Universal Bridge** - Start specific, expand to cultural/historical commentary, return with new meaning

3. **Intellectual Name-Drop (Earned)** - Reference thinkers only when directly relevant. Always explain why.

4. **Contrarian Hook** - Challenge received wisdom without edgelording
   - "In 99% of cases of chronic sedentarism, the inactive person is not lazy. They're bored."

5. **Incarnational Detail** - Specific, sensory, grounding
   - RFK walking in "leather Oxford dress shoes"

6. **Self-Deprecating Confession** - Prevents preachiness, builds trust
   - "I write this admonition as someone who often scrolls Twitter on the couch"

**Target tone:** A coach who has done the thing and believes you can too. A friend who tells you the truth because he respects you. A fellow traveler, slightly ahead on the path.

## The Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Source

- What's the core insight or story?
- What's the emotional arc?
- What's the 30-second version?

### Step 2: Apply SUCKS Framework

**S** - Specific: Write for ONE person
**U** - Unique & Useful: Does this change how they think, feel, or act?
**C** - Clear, Curious, Conversational: Reads like talking to a friend
**K** - Kept Simple & Structured: Simple ideas, clear progression
**S** - Sticky: Memorable phrases they'll repeat

### Step 3: Write or Edit

If editing AI output: **Rewrite, don't patch.** Identify the core message and reconstruct from scratch.

### Step 4: Apply Sticky Sentences

Identify 2-3 most important statements. Try alliteration, symmetry, contrast, rhyme, or rhythm. Combine for maximum stickiness. Full reference: `references/sticky-sentences-expanded.md`

### Step 5: Eliminate AI Tells

Scan against `references/forbidden-patterns.md`. Key checks:
- [ ] Correlative constructions
- [ ] "Just" and "actually" more than once
- [ ] Hedge words (might, could, perhaps)
- [ ] Passive voice
- [ ] Corporate jargon / thesaurus abuse
- [ ] Vague claims without specifics
- [ ] Forbidden flourishes and openers

### Step 6: Read Aloud

- Does it sound like a real person talking?
- Does energy transfer (conversation, not lecture)?
- Is every sentence earning its place?

**The final test:** Would this sentence appear in a ChatGPT output? If yes, rewrite it.

## Writing Fundamentals

### Energy Transfer

The best writing is a transfer of energy from writer to reader. Write conversations, not speeches. Speak WITH your audience, not AT them.

### Conciseness

Every word earns its place. Write first draft freely, then delete anything that repeats, softens, sounds formal, or takes extra words.

### Be Undeniable

Transform vague claims into concrete specifics:
- Bad: "We've helped many clients"
- Good: "We helped 13 clients boost traffic by 87%-256% in one month"

### Leverage Human Desires

Choose 1-2 per piece:

| Desire | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| Safety of Tribe | Community content |
| Survival & Success | Achievement content |
| Life Enjoyment | Lifestyle content |
| Social Acceptance | Status content |
| Comfort & Clarity | Explanatory content |
| Freedom From Fear | Protective content |
