# Trend Researcher

Research current UI/UX design trends from Dribbble and other design communities to inform design decisions.

## Purpose

Before designing, understand what's trending in the design world. This skill helps:
- Identify popular visual styles and aesthetics
- Discover color palette trends
- Learn typography approaches
- See layout patterns in use
- Avoid outdated or overused styles

## Workflow

### Step 1: Navigate to Dribbble

Visit the popular shots pages:

```
https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/web-design
https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/mobile
```

### Step 2: Screenshot and Analyze

For each page:
1. Take a screenshot of the current view
2. Scroll down and take additional screenshots (2-3 scrolls)
3. Analyze the visible designs for:
   - Dominant color schemes
   - Typography styles (serif vs sans-serif, weight, spacing)
   - Layout patterns (bento, cards, full-bleed, etc.)
   - Animation/motion indicators
   - UI element styles (buttons, cards, navigation)

### Step 3: Identify Patterns

Look for recurring themes:

**Color Trends**
- What primary colors appear most?
- Light vs dark mode preference?
- Gradient usage patterns?
- Accent color choices?

**Typography Trends**
- Display fonts: bold, condensed, decorative?
- Body fonts: clean sans, readable serif?
- Weight trends: heavy, light, mixed?
- Spacing: tight, loose, dramatic?

**Layout Trends**
- Grid systems in use
- White space usage
- Card vs full-section layouts
- Navigation patterns

**UI Element Trends**
- Button styles (rounded, sharp, outlined)
- Card designs (shadows, borders, flat)
- Icon styles (outlined, filled, animated)

### Step 4: Generate Report

Create a structured trend report:

```markdown
## UI/UX Trend Report - [Date]

### Top Visual Trends
1. **[Trend Name]**: [Description with specific examples seen]
2. **[Trend Name]**: [Description with specific examples seen]
3. **[Trend Name]**: [Description with specific examples seen]

### Color Trends

- **Background approaches**: [light/dark/gradient patterns]
- **Accent colors**: [popular accent choices]

### Typography Trends
- **Heading styles**: [observations about display fonts]
- **Body text**: [readable font choices]
- **Font weight trends**: [heavy/light/mixed]

### Layout Patterns
1. **[Pattern]**: [description + where seen]
2. **[Pattern]**: [description + where seen]

### Elements to Avoid
- [Outdated pattern 1]
- [Overused style 1]

### Recommended Direction
Based on this analysis, suggest: [aesthetic direction that feels fresh]

## Fallback Mode

If browser tools are unavailable:
1. Note that trend research requires browser access
2. Suggest user share screenshots or describe sites they like
3. Reference general current trends from knowledge:
   - Dark mode with accent colors
   - Bento grid layouts
   - Large typography
   - Micro-interactions
   - Glassmorphism (fading)
   - Neobrutalism (rising)
   - Variable fonts
   - 3D elements and depth

## Output

The trend report should inform:
- Aesthetic direction selection
- Color palette choices
- Typography decisions
- Layout structure
- What to avoid (outdated patterns)
