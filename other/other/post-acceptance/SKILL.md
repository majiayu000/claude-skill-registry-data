# Post-Acceptance Conference Preparation

A post-acceptance conference preparation workflow that helps researchers efficiently complete presentations, posters, and promotional content.

## Core Features

### 1. Presentation Slide Creation

Guidance for creating conference presentation slides:

**Time Control**
- 15-minute talk: 10-15 slides
- 20-minute talk: 15-20 slides
- 30-minute talk: 20-30 slides
- Average 1-1.5 minutes per slide

**Content Structure**
- Title slide (1)
- Motivation/Problem (2-3)
- Method overview (3-5)
- Key results (3-5)
- Conclusion (1-2)
- Q&A/Thank you (1)

**Visual Design Principles**
- One key message per slide
- Use figures and diagrams over text
- Consistent color scheme and fonts
- Minimum font size: 24pt for body, 32pt for titles
- High-contrast colors for readability

**Presentation Tips**
- Practice timing with a stopwatch
- Prepare backup slides for anticipated questions
- Use animations sparingly and purposefully
- Include slide numbers for Q&A reference

### 2. Academic Poster Design

Guidance for creating conference posters:

**Standard Sizes**
- Portrait: 24x36 inches or A0 (841x1189mm)
- Landscape: 36x24 inches or A0 landscape
- Check conference requirements for specific size

**Layout Structure**
- Title bar (top): Title, authors, affiliations, logos
- Introduction (left): Problem statement, motivation
- Method (center): Key approach, architecture diagram
- Results (right): Main findings, tables, figures
- Conclusion (bottom): Summary, future work, QR code

**Design Guidelines**
- Readable from 4-6 feet distance
- Title font: 72-96pt
- Section headers: 36-48pt
- Body text: 24-32pt
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs
- Include QR code linking to paper/code

### 3. Promotion Content Creation

Guidance for creating promotional content after paper acceptance:

**Twitter/X Thread**
- Thread structure: Hook -> Problem -> Method -> Key Result -> Link
- First tweet: Attention-grabbing summary with emoji
- Include 1-2 key figures
- End with paper link and relevant hashtags
- Tag co-authors and relevant accounts

**LinkedIn Post**
- Professional tone, 3-5 paragraphs
- Highlight practical implications
- Include key figure or diagram
- Add relevant hashtags

**Blog Post**
- 800-1500 words
- Non-technical summary for broader audience
- Include figures with explanations
- Link to paper, code, and demo

## When to Use

Use this skill in the following scenarios:

- **After paper acceptance** - Prepare presentation materials for the conference
- **Poster session preparation** - Design and create academic poster
- **Research promotion** - Create social media and blog content
- **Conference talk preparation** - Structure and practice presentation

## Workflow

### Presentation Workflow
```
Paper accepted -> Identify key messages -> Create slide outline -> Design slides -> Practice timing -> Prepare Q&A backup slides
```

### Poster Workflow
```
Paper accepted -> Choose layout template -> Extract key content -> Design poster -> Print test at reduced size -> Final print
```

### Promotion Workflow
```
Paper accepted -> Write Twitter thread -> Create LinkedIn post -> Draft blog post -> Schedule posts around conference dates
```

## Best Practices

### Presentation
- Start with the "so what" - why should the audience care
- Tell a story: problem -> insight -> solution -> impact
- Use concrete examples and demos when possible
- Anticipate questions and prepare answers
- Arrive early to test equipment

### Poster
- Design for scanning, not reading
- Use visual hierarchy to guide the eye
- Include a "elevator pitch" summary
- Bring business cards or QR codes
- Practice a 2-minute and 5-minute explanation

### Promotion
- Post within 1-2 weeks of acceptance notification
- Coordinate timing with co-authors
- Engage with comments and questions
- Share across multiple platforms
- Include accessible descriptions for figures

## Summary

This skill provides a comprehensive post-acceptance workflow covering three key areas: presentation slides, academic posters, and promotional content. Following these guidelines helps researchers effectively communicate their work at conferences and to the broader community.
