## Methodology Foundation

**Source:** Adele Revella - *Buyer Personas: How to Gain Insight into your Customer's Expectations, Align your Marketing Strategies, and Win More Business* (2015)

**Core Principle:** Buyer personas should be built on **buying insights**—the actual factors that influence purchase decisions—not demographic profiles or job titles. The 5 Rings of Buying Insight provide a framework for capturing what really matters.

> "Buyer personas are examples or archetypes of real buyers that allow marketers to craft strategies to promote products and services to the people who might buy them... based on real stories related by actual buyers."

## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures video workflow | Final creative vision |
| Suggests shot compositions | Equipment selection |
| Creates storyboard templates | Brand aesthetics |
| Generates script frameworks | Final approval |
| Identifies technical requirements | Budget allocation |

## What This Skill Does

When invoked, I will guide you through Revella's buyer persona methodology:

1. **Define the buying decision** to focus your research
2. **Identify interview candidates** (recent buyers, won and lost deals)
3. **Conduct insight interviews** using the storytelling approach
4. **Analyze findings** through the 5 Rings framework
5. **Determine persona segmentation** based on meaningful differences
6. **Create actionable persona documents** with buying insights
7. **Apply insights** to messaging, content, and sales enablement

---

## How to Use

Provide information about your situation:

**Example prompts:**

- "Help me create buyer personas for our enterprise HR software"
- "I need to understand why we're losing deals to [competitor]"
- "Create a buyer persona interview guide for our B2B SaaS product"
- "Analyze these interview transcripts and build buyer personas"
- "Our personas are outdated—help me refresh them with the 5 Rings framework"

**Information that helps:**

- Your product/service category
- Target market and typical buyer roles
- Current understanding of your buyers (even if assumed)
- Access to recent buyers for interviews
- Won/lost deal information
- Competitive context

---

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Define the Buying Decision

**Critical first step:** Buyer personas should focus on a specific buying decision, not a general profile.

**Define:**
1. **What solution category** are you analyzing? (e.g., "project management software," not "all our products")
2. **What decision** do you want to influence? (e.g., "initial vendor selection," "upgrade decision")
3. **What timeframe** for buyer memories? (ideally last 6-12 months)

**Why This Matters:** Vague personas lead to vague insights. A sharp focus on one buying decision yields actionable intelligence.

---

### Phase 2: Plan Buyer Interviews

**Who to Interview:**

| Category | Why | Target # |
|----------|-----|----------|
| Recent buyers (won) | Understand what worked | 3-5 |
| Recent buyers (lost) | Understand what didn't | 3-5 |
| Buyers who chose status quo | Understand barriers | 2-3 |
| Buyers from key segments | Ensure coverage | As needed |

**Interview Logistics:**
- 30-45 minutes per interview
- Phone or video (easier to schedule than in-person)
- Record with permission (for transcription)
- Interviewer should NOT be the salesperson

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't interview prospects who haven't completed a decision
- Don't use surveys as a substitute
- Don't interview internal "experts" about what buyers think

---

### Phase 3: Conduct Insight Interviews

**The Opening Question:**

> "Take me back to the day when you first decided to evaluate [solution type]. What happened?"

This open-ended question triggers storytelling and reveals Priority Initiative naturally.

**Follow-Up Probes (use throughout):**
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "What happened next?"
- "Who else was involved at that point?"
- "What were you thinking when that happened?"
- "How did you go about evaluating that?"
- "What concerned you about that?"

**Key Interviewing Principles:**

1. **Listen more than talk** - Your job is to capture their story
2. **Follow their lead** - Let the story unfold naturally
3. **Probe for specifics** - "Reliable" means different things to different buyers
4. **Avoid hypotheticals** - "What would you do if..." yields unreliable data
5. **Don't lead** - "Was price important?" biases the response
6. **Capture exact language** - Their words become your messaging

**Questions to Ensure Full Coverage:**

| Ring | Questions |
|------|-----------|
| Priority Initiative | "What was happening that made you decide to look for a solution?" |
| Success Factors | "What results were you hoping to achieve?" |
| Perceived Barriers | "Were there any concerns that almost stopped you? What did you think about vendors you eliminated?" |
| Decision Criteria | "What specific questions did you need answered? What capabilities were you evaluating?" |
| Buyer's Journey | "Walk me through the steps you took. Who else was involved? What resources did you consult?" |

### Phase 4: Analyze Through the 5 Rings

After completing interviews, organize findings into the 5 Rings framework.

#### Ring 1: Priority Initiative
**What triggers buyers to start evaluating NOW?**

Extract:
- Trigger events (organizational changes, problems, growth)
- Personal circumstances (new role, mandate from above)
- External factors (market changes, competitive pressure)
- Timing factors (budget cycles, planning periods)

#### Ring 2: Success Factors
**What outcomes do buyers expect to achieve?**

Extract:
- Business outcomes expected
- Personal outcomes expected
- Timeline expectations
- How they'll measure success

#### Ring 3: Perceived Barriers
**What fears and concerns cause hesitation or rejection?**

Extract:
- Concerns about your category/solution type
- Concerns about your company specifically
- Concerns about change/implementation
- Reasons competitors were preferred
- Reasons for staying with status quo

#### Ring 4: Decision Criteria
**What specific attributes do buyers evaluate?**

Extract:
- Questions buyers asked during evaluation
- Features/capabilities compared
- Company/vendor attributes compared
- Integration/compatibility requirements
- Pricing/commercial considerations

#### Ring 5: Buyer's Journey
**How do buyers navigate from trigger to decision?**

Extract:
- Steps in the evaluation process
- Who's involved at each step
- Information sources trusted
- Timeline from trigger to decision
- How finalists were selected

---

### Phase 5: Determine Persona Segmentation

**Key Principle:** You need far fewer personas than you think.

**When to Create Separate Personas:**

Only segment when there are **meaningful differences in buying behavior:**

| Ring | Segmentation Trigger |
|------|---------------------|
| Priority Initiative | Different triggers/problems drive the search |
| Success Factors | Different outcomes are expected |
| Perceived Barriers | Different concerns block progress |
| Decision Criteria | Different factors are evaluated |
| Buyer's Journey | Different process/stakeholders involved |

**When NOT to Segment:**

- Different job titles with same buying behavior
- Different industries with same buying behavior
- Different company sizes with same buying behavior

**Goal:** Fewest personas that capture meaningful differences (often 2-4).

---

### Phase 6: Create the Persona Document

**Structure for Each Persona:**

```
PERSONA NAME: [Descriptive name based on key characteristic]

PRIORITY INITIATIVE
What triggers them to evaluate: [List 2-4 key triggers]
Key quote: "[Direct quote from interview]"

SUCCESS FACTORS
Outcomes they expect: [List 3-5 expected results]
Key quote: "[Direct quote from interview]"

PERCEIVED BARRIERS
Concerns that cause hesitation: [List 3-5 barriers]
Reasons they reject vendors: [List key disqualifiers]
Key quote: "[Direct quote from interview]"

DECISION CRITERIA
Questions they need answered: [List 5-8 key questions]
Capabilities they evaluate: [List key evaluation factors]
Key quote: "[Direct quote from interview]"

BUYER'S JOURNEY
Steps in their process: [Numbered list of steps]
Key stakeholders: [Who's involved and when]
Trusted resources: [Information sources they consult]
Typical timeline: [Duration from trigger to decision]
```

---

### Phase 7: Apply Insights

**To Messaging:**

Map buyer language to your messaging:
- Use their words for problems (Priority Initiatives)
- Lead with outcomes they want (Success Factors)
- Address concerns proactively (Perceived Barriers)
- Answer their questions directly (Decision Criteria)

**To Content Strategy:**

| Buyer Journey Stage | Content Focus | Sources from Insights |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Early | Problem/trigger awareness | Priority Initiatives |
| Middle | Evaluation guidance | Decision Criteria, Barriers |
| Late | Decision support | Success Factors, Proof |

**To Sales Enablement:**

- Talk tracks addressing Perceived Barriers
- Qualification questions based on Priority Initiatives
- Competitive battlecards based on Decision Criteria
- Proposal templates featuring Success Factor language

## Examples

### Example 1: B2B Marketing Automation Platform

**Context:** Marketing automation vendor losing deals to established competitors

**5 Rings Analysis:**

**Priority Initiative:**
- "Our current tool couldn't handle the volume as we scaled"
- "Marketing ops person left and no one could manage the legacy system"
- "CEO mandated we prove marketing ROI—needed better attribution"

**Success Factors:**
- Single source of truth for customer journey
- Ability to prove marketing's contribution to revenue
- Platform marketing ops AND demand gen can both use
- Reduce time building reports

**Perceived Barriers:**
- "We worried a smaller vendor might not survive"
- "Concerned about migration from [legacy tool]—years of data"
- "IT pushed back on security certifications"
- "We didn't think you could handle our integration requirements"

**Decision Criteria:**
- Native CRM integration (specific platforms)
- Attribution modeling capabilities
- Implementation timeline and support
- Customer references in our industry
- Total cost of ownership (not just license)

**Buyer's Journey:**
1. Marketing leader identifies need, gets budget approval
2. Marketing ops creates requirements document
3. Team reviews G2/analyst reports, creates shortlist
4. Sales demos with 3-4 vendors
5. Proof of concept with 2 finalists
6. Reference calls and security review
7. Final decision with VP/CMO sign-off

**Resulting Actions:**
- Created "migration playbook" content addressing data concerns
- Added industry-specific case studies to late-stage content
- Developed ROI calculator for attribution modeling
- Sales trained on "smaller vendor" objection handling

### Example 2: Professional Services Firm (Consulting)

**Context:** Management consulting firm expanding into new service line

**5 Rings Analysis:**

**Priority Initiative:**
- "Board pressure to accelerate digital transformation"
- "New CTO came in with mandate to modernize"
- "Competitors were pulling ahead—we needed help fast"
- "Failed internal attempt made us realize we needed outside expertise"

**Success Factors:**
- Tangible results within 6 months
- Skills transfer to internal team (not just deliverables)
- Executive alignment on transformation roadmap
- Quick wins to build momentum and maintain executive support

**Perceived Barriers:**
- "Consultants who don't understand our industry context"
- "Junior staff doing the work while partners disappear"
- "Recommendations that aren't practical for our organization"
- "Expensive engagements that don't deliver promised value"

**Decision Criteria:**
- Relevant industry experience (specific examples)
- Team composition and senior involvement commitment
- Methodology for knowledge transfer
- Fixed vs. variable pricing models
- Client references we can actually talk to

**Buyer's Journey:**
1. C-level identifies need, informal conversations begin
2. Internal champion (often VP/Director) tasked to find options
3. RFP or informal inquiry to 3-5 firms
4. Chemistry meetings with potential teams
5. Proposal review and negotiation
6. Final decision often at board/C-suite level

**Resulting Personas:**

**"Mandated Transformer"** (CTO/CDO)
- Trigger: New in role with explicit transformation mandate
- Primary concern: Delivering results fast enough to maintain support
- Key criteria: Speed to impact, industry credibility

**"Reluctant Outsourcer"** (VP Operations)
- Trigger: Failed internal attempt created urgency
- Primary concern: Consultants who don't actually transfer skills
- Key criteria: Knowledge transfer methodology, team composition
