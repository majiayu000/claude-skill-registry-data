# Consistent Code Structure

API endpoints should follow the same structure: validation, authorization, business logic, response. React components should organize hooks, handlers, and render consistently. Test files should have consistent describe/it structures. When similar operations exist, they should look similar. Consistency enables developers to understand new code quickly by pattern recognition.
