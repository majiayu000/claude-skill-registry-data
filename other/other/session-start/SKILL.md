## Your Task

Run the full session start procedure and report project status to the user.

---

# Session Start Skill

You perform the 8-step session startup procedure that initializes a working session.

---

## Step 1: Verify Setup

Quick dependency check:

```bash
python3 -c "import mcp" 2>&1 >/dev/null && echo "MCP ready" || echo "MCP missing"
```

- If MCP missing: **Stop immediately** and suggest: `/bitwize-music:setup mcp`
- If config missing (`~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` doesn't exist): suggest `/bitwize-music:configure`
- Don't proceed until setup is complete

## Step 2: Load Config

Read `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml`.

If missing, tell user to run `/bitwize-music:configure`.

## Step 3: Load Overrides

Read `paths.overrides` from config (default: `{content_root}/overrides`):

- Check for `{overrides}/CLAUDE.md` — incorporate instructions if found
- Check for `{overrides}/pronunciation-guide.md` — note if found
- Skip silently if missing (overrides are optional)

## Step 4: Load State Cache

Read `~/.bitwize-music/cache/state.json`:

- If missing, corrupted, schema mismatch, or config changed: rebuild
  ```bash
  python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/state/indexer.py rebuild
  ```
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is the directory containing the plugin's CLAUDE.md file

## Step 5: Check Skill Models

Run `/bitwize-music:skill-model-updater check` to verify all skills use current model versions.

Report any outdated models found.

## Step 6: Report From State Cache

Using data from `state.json`, report:

### Album Ideas
From `state.ideas.counts` — show count by status (Pending, In Progress, etc.)

### In-Progress Albums
Filter `state.albums` for status: "In Progress", "Research Complete", "Complete"

For each, show:
- Album name, genre, status
- Track progress (completed/total)

### Pending Source Verifications
From `state.albums` — find tracks where `sources_verified` is "Pending"

If any found, warn: "These tracks have unverified sources — generation is blocked until verified."

### Last Session Context
From `state.session`:
- Last album worked on
- Last phase
- Pending actions

## Step 7: Show Contextual Tips

Based on state, show ONE relevant tip:

| Condition | Tip |
|-----------|-----|
| No albums exist | "Try `/bitwize-music:tutorial` to create your first album" |
| Ideas exist but no albums | "You have album ideas! Use `/bitwize-music:album-ideas list` to review them" |
| In-progress albums exist | "Resume where you left off: `/bitwize-music:resume <album-name>`" |
| Overrides loaded | "Custom overrides loaded from {overrides}/" |
| Overrides missing | "Customize your workflow with override files — see `/reference/overrides/`" |
| Pending verifications | "Source verification needed before generation can proceed" |

Also show one random general tip (rotate through these):
- "Ask 'what should I do next?' for workflow guidance"
- "Use `/bitwize-music:resume` to quickly jump back into an album"
- "The researcher skill coordinates 10 specialized sub-skills for deep research"
- "Check pronunciation before generating — Suno can't infer from context"
- "Use `/bitwize-music:clipboard` to copy lyrics/prompts for Suno"
- "Master your audio with `/bitwize-music:mastering-engineer` for professional results"

## Step 8: Ask

End with: "What would you like to work on?"

## Remember

1. **Don't skip steps** — Each step matters for session integrity
2. **Rebuild state if needed** — Stale state leads to wrong recommendations
3. **Be concise** — This is a status report, not a conversation
4. **Warn about verifications** — Unverified sources block generation
5. **One tip, not five** — Pick the most relevant tip for the current state
