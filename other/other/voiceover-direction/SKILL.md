# Voiceover Direction

> Master the art of directing voice talent to deliver performances that match your brand vision, using Anne Ganguzza's storytelling approach and industry best practices.

## When to Use This Skill

- Hiring and briefing voiceover artists for a project
- Giving direction during recording sessions
- Writing scripts that are easy for talent to deliver
- Matching voice characteristics to brand personality
- Reviewing auditions and selecting the right talent
- Improving the quality of existing voiceover work

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: Anne Ganguzza (VO Coach) + Industry Best Practices

**Core Principle**: "Voice actors aren't just readers; they're actors. Your job as director is to give them the emotional context and story to tell, not just words to read." Great voiceover direction focuses on intention, not inflection—tell the talent WHY they're saying something, not HOW to say it.

**Why This Matters**: The difference between amateur and professional content is often the voiceover. A skilled voice artist with poor direction sounds worse than a mediocre talent with excellent direction. Learning to direct voice talent transforms your video and audio content quality immediately.

## Instructions

When directing voiceover, follow this methodology:

### Step 1: Create the VO Brief

Before reaching out to talent, document everything they need to know.

```
## Voiceover Brief Template

### Project Overview
**Project name**:
**Format**: [Explainer video / Commercial / E-learning / Audiobook / etc.]
**Duration**: [total runtime]
**Usage**: [Where will this be used? Rights needed?]

### Brand Context
**Company**: [Brief description]
**Brand personality**: [3-5 adjectives]
**Existing voice references**: [Links to previous VO work, if any]
**Competing brands to avoid sounding like**: [if relevant]

### Target Audience
**Who**: [Demographics, psychographics]
**Their relationship to brand**: [New customer? Loyal fan? Skeptical?]
**Emotional state when watching**: [Busy? Relaxed? Stressed?]

### Voice Specifications
**Gender preference**: [Any / Male / Female / Non-binary]
**Age range**: [Vocal age, not literal age]
**Accent**: [Specific requirements]
**Tone**: [Warm, authoritative, playful, urgent, etc.]
**Pace**: [Conversational, quick, measured, etc.]
**Energy level**: [1-10 scale]

### Reference Examples
**Sound-alike references**: [Links to similar VO that captures desired tone]
**Anti-references**: [What you DON'T want—examples of wrong direction]

### Practical Details
**Script attached**: [Yes/No]
**Word count**:

```

**Key consideration**: The more specific your brief, the faster you find the right talent.

### Step 2: Write Speakable Copy

Scripts for voiceover must be written for the ear, not the eye.

```
## Script Preparation Checklist

### Structure
□ Short sentences (15 words max)
□ One idea per sentence
□ Natural contractions (don't, won't, it's)
□ Breathing room built in (punctuation, line breaks)

### Readability
□ Read aloud 3x before finalizing
□ No tongue twisters or awkward consonant clusters
□ Complex words spelled phonetically in parentheses
□ Numbers written as words (three million, not 3,000,000)
□ Acronyms spelled out with pronunciation guide

### Delivery Cues
□ Key emphasis words underlined or bolded
□ [Pause] markers where needed
□ (Tone shift notes in parentheses)
□ Section breaks clearly marked

### Timing
□ Word count noted per section
□ Target duration calculated (÷ 150 WPM)
□ 10-15% buffer for natural delivery
```

**Example Script Formatting**:
```
[OPENING - Warm, curious]

Ever wonder why some companies just... get it?

[PAUSE]

They know exactly what you need (beat) before you do.

[SHIFT TO - Confident, energetic]

That's the power of DataFlow. Our AI doesn't just analyze your customers—
it anticipates them.
```

### Step 3: Cast the Right Voice

Matching voice to brand requires systematic evaluation.

```
## Voice Casting Criteria

### Acoustic Qualities
- **Pitch**: Low, medium, high
- **Resonance**: Chest voice, head voice, balanced
- **Texture**: Smooth, gravelly, breathy, clear
- **Presence**: Intimate/close, broadcast/distant

### Performance Qualities
- **Warmth**: Cold → Warm scale
- **Authority**: Peer → Expert scale
- **Energy**: Calm → Dynamic scale
- **Authenticity**: Polished → Conversational scale

### Brand Alignment Questions
1. Does this voice sound like our brand would sound?
2. Would our target audience trust this voice?
3. Does it stand out from competitors?
4. Can this voice grow with our brand?
5. Is there versatility for different content types?
```

**Audition Request Template**:
```
## Audition Instructions

Please record the following selection in TWO different reads:

**Read 1**: [Primary direction, e.g., "warm and conversational, like explaining to a friend"]

**Read 2**: [Alternate direction, e.g., "slightly more authoritative, like a trusted advisor"]

Selected script excerpt:
[30-60 seconds of representative copy]

Technical requirements:
- WAV or AIFF format, 44.1kHz, 16-bit minimum
- Dry recording (no effects)
- Clean room tone at the end (3 seconds of silence)
```

---

### Step 4: Direct the Session

Live direction is about creating the conditions for great performance.

```
## Session Direction Framework

### Opening (5 minutes)
- Thank them, build rapport
- Share the context they need (not everything)
- Describe the listener/viewer
- Set the emotional intention

### First Take
- "Let's do a full take so I can hear your instincts"
- Don't interrupt the first read
- Note specific moments to address

### Direction Techniques

**DO - Give intention, not inflection**:
✓ "This person just solved a problem that's been bugging them for months"
✓ "You're sharing a secret with your best friend"
✓ "This is the moment they've been waiting to hear"

**DON'T - Give line readings**:
✗ "Make it go UP at the end"
✗ "Emphasize THIS word"
✗ "Slower on that part"

**DO - Use emotional anchors**:
✓ "Remember how you felt when..."
✓ "Imagine you're telling your kid about..."
✓ "This is the 'finally!' moment"

### Common Adjustments
- **Too announcer-y**: "Throw it away more. Like you're just telling me."
- **Too flat**: "What's exciting about this for you?"
- **Too much**: "Let the words do the work. You don't have to sell so hard."
- **Wrong pace**: "Take your time. The viewer isn't going anywhere."
- **Missing emotion**: "Before this line, take a breath and think about [emotional context]"
```

---

### Step 5: Give Actionable Feedback

For remote work with pickups and revisions.

```
## Feedback Framework

### Structure Your Notes

**Timestamp**: Line or timecode
**Current issue**: What's happening now
**Desired change**: What you want instead
**Why**: The story reason (not just preference)

### Examples of Good vs. Bad Feedback

❌ Bad: "Line 3 doesn't sound right"
✓ Good: "Line 3 ('We're different') - currently sounds defensive. Could we try it more confident, like stating a fact they already know?"

❌ Bad: "More energy"
✓ Good: "The middle section (0:45-1:15) feels like you're reading. Can you imagine you just discovered this and you're excited to share it?"

❌ Bad: "Make it warmer"
✓ Good: "On the opening line, I'm hearing 'CEO addressing shareholders.' Can we try 'friend giving advice over coffee?'"

### Pickup Session Template

Hi [Talent name],

Thanks for the great session! A few pickups:

1. **Line 5** ("Our platform integrates...") - Let's try this more conversational, like you're answering a question someone just asked.

2. **Line 12** ("Get started today") - Currently a bit pushy. Can we try it as an invitation, not a command?

3. **Wild line**: Can you give me one natural, unscripted version of the closing? Just in your own words.

Please deliver by [date]. Let me know if any direction is unclear!
```

### Example 2: Directing a Session

**Context**: Live session with voice talent who's reading too "salesy."

**Input**:
> My voice talent is reading our script like a commercial. It sounds fake. How do I redirect them without insulting their work?

**Output**:

## Session Redirection Approach

### Step 1: Validate First
"That was great! You've got the energy and the words down. Now I want to try something a bit different."

### Step 2: Reset the Context
"Forget this is a commercial for a second. Here's the situation: You're at a dinner party. A friend asks what you do. You love your job but you're also tired and relaxed. How would you tell them about this product?"

### Step 3: Remove the Script
"Let's try something. Put the script down. Just tell me—in your own words—what this product does. Don't worry about the exact copy."

*[Let them improvise for 30 seconds]*

"That! That's the tone I'm looking for. Now let's bring that energy back to the script."

### Step 4: Adjust the Script
For lines that still sound commercial:

**"Get started today"**
→ "You could try it like you're just mentioning it offhand. Like, 'oh by the way, you can get started today.' Not a big deal."

**"Transform your workflow"**
→ "Let's land on this like you're making a promise to a friend, not a claim to a stranger."

### Step 5: Give Them the 'Why'
"The people watching this have seen a hundred software videos. They can smell marketing. We want them to feel like they're talking to a real person who actually uses this thing."
