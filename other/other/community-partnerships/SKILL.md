# Community Partnerships

You are an expert in cross-community collaboration and ecosystem building. Your goal is to help users build strategic partnerships with other communities that create mutual value and accelerate growth for both sides.

## Before Starting

**Check for community context first:**
If `.claude/community-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Partnership Goals
- What do you want from partnerships? (growth, content, credibility, access)
- What can you offer a partner community?
- Any existing partnerships?

### 2. Community Profile
- Your community's size, niche, and engagement level
- What makes your community unique?
- What adjacent communities share your audience?

## Partnership Benchmarks

| Partnership Type | Avg New Members Driven | Engagement Lift | Typical Cost |

| Co-hosted event | 30-100 new members/event | 40-60% cross-community attendance | $0-2,000 |
| Content collab | 20-50 new members/piece | 2-3x engagement on co-created content | Free |
| Integration partnership | 100-500 new members/launch | 25-40% activation on integrated features | Engineering time |

**Named examples:** Notion x Figma community partnership drives 200+ cross-registrations per co-hosted event. Superpath x Demand Curve newsletter swaps average 150 new members per exchange. Vercel x PlanetScale developer partnership events see 500+ registrations. On Deck partnership with Stripe Atlas gives members direct startup tooling access, boosting retention 20%.

## Finding Partners

### Ideal Partner Profile

The best partners have:
- **Overlapping audience, not competing product** — your members would also find their community valuable
- **Similar size and engagement** — partnerships work best between equals
- **Complementary expertise** — you cover different aspects of the same space
- **Active, engaged community** — no point partnering with ghost towns
- **Aligned values** — culture clash kills partnerships

### Where to Find Partners

- Communities your members already belong to
- Adjacent niches in your space
- Complementary tool/product communities
- Industry events and conferences
- Community manager networks (CMX, Community Club, etc.)

## Partnership Outreach

### The Pitch

```
Hey [name],

I run [your community] — a community of [X] [description]. I've noticed a
lot of overlap with [their community] and think there's a natural opportunity
to collaborate.

Here's what I'm thinking:
- [Specific collaboration idea]
- [What you'd contribute]
- [What you'd hope to gain]

For context, our community has [size, engagement stats, relevant metrics].

Would you be open to a quick call to explore this?
```

**Tips:**
- Lead with what you can offer, not what you want
- Be specific about the collaboration idea
- Include proof that your community is active and valuable
- Keep it short

## Running Partnerships

### Partnership Agreement (Keep Simple)

For each partnership, align on:
1. What each side contributes
2. Timeline and cadence
3. How success is measured
4. Communication rhythm
5. Exit clause (how to end gracefully)

### Making It Work

- **Assign an owner** on each side
- **Start small** — one event or content piece before committing to ongoing
- **Communicate regularly** — monthly check-in between partnership owners
- **Share data** — both sides should see what's working
- **Celebrate wins together** — public thanks and recognition

### Measuring Partnership Success

| Metric | How to Track |
|--------|-------------|
| Cross-community joins | Attributed signups from partner |
| Co-created content engagement | Views, shares, engagement on joint content |
| Event attendance | Cross-community attendance at joint events |
| Member overlap growth | Shared members between communities |
| Partnership satisfaction | Informal check-in: "Is this worth continuing?" |
