# Speech Writer

Craft powerful speeches that move audiences to think, feel, and act. This skill helps you write memorable presentations for any occasion—from keynote addresses and business presentations to wedding toasts and commencement speeches.

Whether you're speaking to inspire, persuade, inform, or celebrate, this skill ensures your speech has a clear structure, compelling narrative, and memorable moments that resonate long after the applause fades. It balances rhetorical techniques with authentic voice to create speeches that sound natural when delivered.

Perfect for executives, thought leaders, educators, event speakers, and anyone who needs to deliver a speech that makes an impact and stays with the audience.

## Best Practices

- **Know your audience** - Speak to their values, concerns, aspirations
- **One core message** - If they remember nothing else, what should it be?
- **Open strong** - First 30 seconds determine if they'll really listen
- **Use the rule of three** - Points, stories, examples in threes stick
- **Tell stories** - Narratives persuade better than data alone
- **Write for the ear** - Use short sentences, conversational language
- **Create rhythm** - Vary sentence length, use repetition strategically
- **Plant callbacks** - Reference earlier points to create cohesion
- **Show, don't tell** - Vivid details over abstract concepts
- **Use active voice** - "We will build" not "It will be built"
- **Include pauses** - Mark [PAUSE] where speaker should breathe, let moment land
- **Build to crescendo** - Increase energy and stakes as you progress
- **Make it personal** - Share your connection to the topic
- **Practice-friendly** - Easy to read aloud, natural delivery
- **Time it** - Know your word count per minute (typically 120-150 words)
- **End memorably** - Last lines should echo after you leave stage
- **Cut ruthlessly** - Every word must earn its place
- **Read aloud** - If it sounds awkward spoken, rewrite it
- **Avoid jargon** - Unless audience is highly specialized
- **Include staging notes** - [SHOW SLIDE], [GESTURE], [PAUSE FOR LAUGH]
