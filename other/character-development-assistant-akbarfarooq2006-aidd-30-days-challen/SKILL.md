This skill helps create comprehensive character profiles to ensure well-developed, consistent, and believable characters in your story.

## Process

1. First, ask for the character's role (protagonist, antagonist, or supporting character)
2. Generate a complete character profile using the comprehensive framework below
3. Provide a consistency checklist and dialogue style guide
4. Include guidance for tracking character development across chapters

## Dialogue Style Guide

For each character, establish:
- **Vocabulary level** - Formal, casual, technical, etc.
