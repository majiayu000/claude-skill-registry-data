# HyperShots — spec-reliable App Store screenshots

Deterministic where it must be (HTML/CSS: device frames, fonts, copy, exact canvas, locales), generative only where it helps (cutout stickers, optional style grade). You author bespoke panel HTML per app; the scripts guarantee the specs.

## When to use / when not

Use for: App Store screenshot sets, localizing an existing set, revising panels, "make my screenshots cooler", Apple screenshot-spec questions, submitting a finished set to ASC. NOT for: general image generation, social/OG images, capturing simulator screenshots (→ fastlane snapshot).

## Intent router

| User wants | Read first | Then |
|---|---|---|
| New screenshot set | `references/create.md` | scaffold → brief → theme → author → render → self-review → validate |
| Pick fonts for the app | `references/typography.md` | mirror the brand or use the menu → `scripts/fetch-fonts.sh` vendors it |
| Tweak headline/sticker/theme | `references/revise.md` | edit → re-render → re-validate |
| Localize an existing set | `references/translate.md` + `references/i18n.md` | extract keys → strings.<locale>.json → inject → render → validate |
| Stylized/graded look | `references/edit-filter.md` | `edit-pass.sh` per panel, `grade-set.sh` for a set-consistent pass (needs genmedia + ImageMagick) |
| Generated stickers/backgrounds | `references/asset-recipes.md` | pinned genmedia recipes + degraded mode |
| Need captures / mid-gesture frames | `references/capture-recipes.md` | simctl status-bar/appearance/burst recipes |
| Submit the set to App Store Connect | `references/fastlane-deliver.md` | validate → copy `out/` → `fastlane/screenshots/<asc-locale>/` → deliver lane |
| Apple size/spec question | `references/store-specs.md` | canvas table, asset rules |
| Feature the set on hypershots.dev | `references/gallery-submission.md` | consent-gated GitHub issue |
| Something looks wrong | `references/gotchas.md` | symptom → cause → fix |

## Prerequisites (every session)

```bash
bash <skill>/scripts/preflight.sh
```

Always exits 0 — it's a report, not a gate. `chrome` and `node` are **REQUIRED**: if either is missing, stop and help the user install (or `export CHROME=/path/to/chrome`). `imagemagick` is optional (alpha flatten, style-edit compositing). `genmedia` is optional — needed only for generated assets or a style grade; if missing and the task wants those, **ask the user before installing**: `npm i -g genmedia && genmedia setup` (needs their `FAL_KEY`), then `genmedia skills install genmedia && genmedia skills install fal-models-catalog`. If they decline, use degraded mode (`references/asset-recipes.md`).

## The frame contract

The part every agent must hold even without reading `create.md`:

- Geometry classes are IMMUTABLE (`.panel` `.stage` `.device` `.screen` `.di` `.statusbar`) — sized by profile CSS variables (`--panel-w`/`--panel-h`). Never hardcode panel px, never restyle `.device`. Screen aspect is ~0.460 (w/h). Type classes (`.headline` `.sub` `.eyebrow`) MAY be restyled in theme.css — that's the brand layer's job (fit.js measures actual boxes, so size/weight changes are safe).
- `.stage` is the required absolute layer (`inset:0`) holding the device AND the stickers as siblings — omit it and the device loses its positioning context (wrong but validating).
- NEVER add `.di`/`.statusbar` over a real simulator capture (`<img class="shot">` already contains its own status bar + island) — double-DI bug.
- REQUIRED markers on every panel: `data-i18n="pN.key"` (double-quoted, one line, text + `<br>` only — no other nested markup) on every translatable node; `data-fit` on the headline/sub block; `data-protect="name"` on `.wrap` and `.device`.
- `fit.js` must be the LAST element in `<body>` — it awaits `document.fonts.ready` and dumps the fit/protect boxes render.sh needs.
- Panels must not depend on time, randomness, or animation — render.sh does two Chrome passes (screenshot + DOM dump) and they must agree.
- Full authoring skeleton, sticker primitives, narrative-arc guidance: `references/create.md`.

## Workspace

```bash
bash <skill>/scripts/scaffold.sh [dir=.shots]
```

Runs in the **user's repo** — the installed skill dir is read-only reference, never author there. Refuses to run if `<ws>/brief.md` already exists (you're in revise territory). Panels link kit copies as workspace-sibling paths (`../frame.css`, `../theme.css`, etc.). If `examples/spotless/panels/panel-1.html` exists in your copy of the skill, read it as an annotated example before authoring your first panel.

## The loop that makes output good — mandatory

```
render.sh → Read every rendered PNG yourself → fix → re-render → validate.sh → review page (make-review.mjs) + contact sheet → show the user
```

Read each PNG and check: copy overflow or awkward breaks, clipped/overlapping stickers, `.di`/`.statusbar` double-island, legibility (ink-on-paper contrast, accent not vibrating), stretched/mis-cropped capture. **Never skip the Read** — the validator checks specs, not taste; only your eyes catch a clipped sticker.

`render.sh <ws> [profile=iphone-6.9] [locale=en]` exit codes: **1** generic (no Chrome, no panels, Chrome crash, unknown profile — check `profiles.json`); **2** fit failure (copy hit the floor and still overlaps the device — rewrite the copy, not the floor); **3** panel dims ≠ profile (almost always `../profile.css` missing from the panel `<head>`).

## Common mistakes

`.di`/`.statusbar` over a real capture; hardcoding panel px or restyling `.device` (breaks profiles → gutters → alpha → rejection); a remote font `@import` in theme.css (fonts must be vendored, `font-display:block`); hand-editing `out/` or `panels-<locale>/` (both generated — render purges `out/`, a successful inject purges stale `panels-<locale>/*.html`); skipping `validate.sh` because it "looks right"; re-rendering iPhone panels at `ipad-13` (ipad is a separate authoring pass, 0.75 aspect); single-quoted `data-i18n` (invisible to the injector — ships English, surfaces later as a fatal unused-key error).

## Review checklist (before showing the user)

- [ ] `validate.sh` prints `VALIDATED` for every shipped profile+locale
- [ ] You Read every PNG after the last edit
- [ ] ≤10 panels; the first 3 carry the install decision (only ~3 show before "Show All")
- [ ] Every panel has its markers: `data-i18n`, `data-fit`, `data-protect`
- [ ] Theme is derived from the app's actual brand, not the scaffold's placeholder tokens

## Verify

- Check every command/flag/exit-code claim above against the actual scripts before relying on it — this file summarizes; the scripts are ground truth.
- `npm run validate` (repo root — checks SKILL.md frontmatter) and `bash tests/run-tests.sh` (fixture render/validate/translate suite) should both be green before you consider a skill change done.
