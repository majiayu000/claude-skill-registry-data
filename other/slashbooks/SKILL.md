# Slashbooks

Slashbooks is an open-source alternative to QuickBooks. An AI agent you control imports bank and card activity, closes the month, and creates the files your accountant needs. Instead of paying for a hosted bookkeeping SaaS plus an outsourced bookkeeper, you run the workflow yourself: point the agent at CSV or OFX exports from your bank and credit card providers, and it normalizes the transactions, applies a consistent chart of accounts, categorizes each line, flags duplicates and transfers between your own accounts, and reconciles ending balances against your statements.

When the month is closed it produces accountant-ready outputs: a categorized transaction ledger, a trial balance, and profit-and-loss and balance-sheet summaries you can hand to a CPA at tax time. Use this skill when you want month-end close, transaction categorization, reconciliation, or accountant hand-off files produced by an agent working on data you keep locally, so your financial data is never uploaded to a third-party bookkeeping vendor.

## Installation

Slashbooks is a **plugin marketplace**, not a single root `SKILL.md`. Install the plugin, then use `/books`. Do not `git clone` the repo into `~/.claude/skills` or `~/.agent-skills` — that copies the marketplace root, not a loadable skill.
