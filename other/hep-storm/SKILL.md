# /hep-storm

Drive a goal through the **Stormbreaker Loop** — Hephaestus' force-robust,
verifier-first execution loop — inside this workspace. Unlike a
one-shot answer or a generic parallel fan-out, Stormbreaker **routes the goal to
real Agentlas specialists**, structures the work as a dependency-ordered pipeline
fabric, drives each work packet as a **hardened goal loop** (it does not stall,
run away, or claim false success), and **refuses to report success without
evidence**. Also triggered by `@Hephaestus storm <goal>`.

Use it for loop-worthy work: apps, sites, agents, automations, debugging,
multi-step research, data/report generation — anything with files, tools, tests,
or external verification. Trivial questions should be answered directly, not
stormed.

## Core-owned Goal + UltraCode harness

Every result includes `execution_harness`. Apply
`execution_harness.system_prompt` verbatim before planning or executing packets,
retain its `prompt_sha256`, and never redefine Goal mode or UltraCode mode in
this adapter. Pass live session JSON with `AGENTLAS_SESSION_INVENTORY` when the
host provides it; otherwise use Core's explicit `host:primary` fallback.

The goal is the exact text the user typed after `/hep-storm`.

## How to run

Run the shell block below **verbatim**, replacing only the `GOAL` value with the
user's exact goal text. The block resolves the Hephaestus runner by **absolute
path** and runs it — there is nothing to install and nothing to add to `PATH`.
In an agentic runtime **you are the executor**: the engine gives you the verified
plan (the execution fabric); you carry it out with your own tools.

> Guardrails — do NOT do any of these. They are not how this workflow works and
> have caused fabricated reports before:
> - Do NOT diagnose `command not found` or `PATH`, and do NOT edit `~/.zshrc`.
>   The runner is resolved by absolute path inside the block.
> - Do NOT claim a packet, gate, or external action succeeded without the
>   verifier's evidence. A materialized or scheduled run is not proof.
> - If the runner is genuinely missing, say so and stop. Never fabricate a fix
>   or a run.

GOAL="<replace with the exact text the user typed after /hep-storm>"

case "$GOAL" in
  "<replace"*) echo "GOAL placeholder not filled — substitute the user's goal first." >&2; exit 2 ;;

```

## Act on the route decision

Read `route_decision.action` (or `route_action`) and branch — Stormbreaker only
auto-materializes a full fabric for a **pipeline**; other actions still start a
storm, just with the workforce the router chose:

- `action: "pipeline"` — the result carries the `execution_fabric` (`packets`,
  `parallel_groups`, `sessions`, `resume_policy`), per-packet `write_scope` and
  `goal`/verifier, a `pipeline_id`, a `journal` path, and `final_gate` criteria.
  Run the full loop in "Run the Stormbreaker Loop" below.
- `action: "clarify"` — the goal is ambiguous. Ask `clarify_question` with the
  candidate list as ONE batch, then re-run the block with the refined goal. This
  is the scope-lock ambiguity gate; do not guess past it.
- `action: "route"` (single card) — a one-agent storm: borrow and run that card
  attached to this project, then still apply the verify → repair → final-gate
  steps.
- `action: "hub_fallback"` / `"hub_candidates"` — Hub lookup used redacted
  keywords only. If an `execution` block lists `recommended_agents`, borrow each
  in stage order via `"$RUNNER" hep-call "<agent>" "<goal>" --project .` and run
  them attached to this repo; otherwise report candidates and offer `/hep-build`.
- `action: "propose_new"` — no fit exists; offer to build one via `/hep-build`.
- `action: "refuse"` — explain `reasons` (e.g. loop guard) and stop. Do not retry
  around it.

## Run the Stormbreaker Loop over the fabric

Execute the goal to completion under this protocol. **Do not stop to ask for
confirmation** — this is a force-robust run. Only halt when the goal is verified,
or you are genuinely blocked by auth, payment, policy, a missing secret/tool, or
a required user approval.

1. **scope-lock** — Restate the goal as one sentence and lock to it. Check the
   route decision's failure-memory. If (and only if) the goal is too ambiguous to
   decompose safely, ask ONE batch of 3–5 questions (what NOT to do / smallest
   version / done signal / dependencies), then proceed. If it is already specific,
   ask nothing.
2. **issue contract** — Write the acceptance criteria: the concrete, checkable
   done-signal for each packet and for the whole goal. These become the loop's
   stop criteria.
3. **plan-lock** — Adopt the fabric's `parallel_groups` and `depends_on` ordering
   as the plan. Open a **visible goal ledger**: packet, owner, verification gate,
   status, resume point.
4. **act** — Execute the next unblocked group. Run independent packets in the
   group concurrently where the runtime supports it. When a packet's `card` names
   an Agentlas specialist, **borrow and run it attached to this project** via
   `"$RUNNER" hep-call "<card>" "<goal>" --project .` rather than role-playing it.
   Write artifacts to each packet's `write_scope`.
5. **verify** — A packet passes only with separately attributable, validated
   verification. A `loop.goal_command` exiting 0 may end the goal loop, but it
   cannot verify the executor's own output or self-attest success. Require an
   independent verifier and hash-validated artifact evidence. "It ran" is never
   success.
6. **bounded repair/retry** — On a concrete validation failure, repair and re-run
   that packet — bounded. Honor the goal-loop budget: tolerate transient failures
   with backoff, stop a packet as `stalled` after consecutive no-progress
   iterations, and never exceed its iteration ceiling. A resumed run continues
   from the journal, it does not restart.
7. **final-gate** — Report success only if the fabric's final gate clears
   (`can_report_success`). Run the evidence/security gate on produced artifacts.

Keep visible progress concise: what was attempted, what was **verified**, and
exactly where to resume if blocked. Never expose hidden reasoning — show
progress, evidence, decisions, and final status only.

## Loop invariants (why this beats a one-shot loop)

- **Don't break (안 끊기게):** a transient packet failure is journaled and retried
  with backoff, not fatal. Only a genuine streak of hard failures stops the run.
- **Don't run away:** a hard iteration ceiling plus stall detection — measured
  no-progress stops the loop as `stalled` instead of spinning.
- **Keep the goal until done (될 때까지):** the loop reports `reached_goal` only
  when the verifier proves it. No bare "it ran" ever counts.
- **Survive a hard stop:** every packet is a journal step, so a killed run resumes
  its numbering from the journal instead of colliding or restarting from zero.

## Hard rules

- **No fake pass.** If the engine is unavailable, an account/tool/connector/browser
  session is missing, or a gate did not run, report the run as **blocked or
  unverified with the exact next step** — never as complete. A scheduled or
  materialized run is not proof that an external action succeeded.
- The router only chooses agents and fetches BYOM bundles. Actual tool execution
  follows this runtime's own safety and permission model.
- Report the `receipt_id`, `pipeline_id`, and `journal` path in your final message
  so the run is auditable and resumable.
