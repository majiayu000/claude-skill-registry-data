# Outreach Sequencer

Design and optimize multi-touch email sequences that cut through inbox noise and drive meaningful conversations. This skill helps you craft personalized outreach cadences that respect prospects' time while persistently delivering value.

Cold outreach is hard. Most emails get ignored. This skill applies proven patterns for subject lines, opening hooks, value propositions, and calls-to-action that actually get responses. Learn optimal timing, sequence length, and personalization tactics that turn cold prospects into warm meetings.

Built for SDRs, BDRs, account executives, founders doing outbound, and anyone who needs to start conversations with prospects who don't know them yet.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Cold Outreach Sequence
1. **Prospect Research** - Gather context for personalization
2. **Email 1: Pattern Interrupt** - Stand out with unexpected opening
3. **Email 2: Value Add** - Share relevant insight or resource
4. **Email 3: Social Proof** - Reference similar customer success
5. **Email 4: Objection Preempt** - Address common hesitations
6. **Email 5: Breakup Email** - Create scarcity, offer easy out
7. **Timing Optimization** - Set delays between touches

### Workflow 2: Multi-Channel Sequence
1. **Channel Mapping** - Email, LinkedIn, phone, video touchpoints
2. **Touch Orchestration** - Sequence channels strategically
3. **Email Foundations** - Core messaging across emails
4. **LinkedIn Integration** - Connection requests and InMails
5. **Phone Scripts** - Voicemail and live conversation guides
6. **Video Messages** - Personalized video touchpoints
7. **Unified Tracking** - Measure engagement across channels

### Workflow 3: Re-Engagement Sequence
1. **Dormant Lead Identification** - Find gone-dark contacts
2. **Trigger Research** - Find new reason to reach out
3. **New Value Angle** - Offer fresh perspective or insight
4. **Lower Commitment Ask** - Reduce friction for re-engagement
5. **Multiple Attempts** - Persist with varied approaches
6. **Channel Switch** - Try different communication methods
7. **Sunset Decision** - Know when to move on

### Workflow 4: Warm Introduction Sequence
1. **Referral Context** - Leverage the warm connection
2. **Introduction Email** - Reference mutual connection strongly
3. **Value Alignment** - Connect to referrer's recommendation
4. **Social Proof Stack** - Build on referrer's credibility
5. **Easy Next Step** - Low-friction call-to-action
6. **Referrer Update** - Keep introducer informed
7. **Relationship Nurture** - Maintain referral source

## Best Practices

- **Research first** - 10 minutes of research beats 10 generic emails
- **Pattern interrupt** - First line must earn the second
- **One ask per email** - Clarity beats comprehensiveness
- **Personalize authentically** - Fake personalization is worse than none
- **Front-load value** - Give before you ask
- **Respect timing** - 3-5 business days between emails typically
- **Vary your approach** - Each email should feel different
- **Use social proof** - Name-drop relevant customers
- **Test everything** - Subject lines, send times, CTAs
- **Keep it short** - Under 125 words typically performs best
- **Mobile-first** - Most emails read on phones
- **Clear CTA** - One obvious next step
- **Include breakup** - Creates urgency, respects time
- **Track and iterate** - Measure open rates, reply rates, meeting rates
- **Stay human** - Automation shouldn't feel automated
