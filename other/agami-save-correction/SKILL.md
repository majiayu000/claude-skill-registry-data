# agami save-correction

**Before suggesting any slash command in chat, read [`shared/invocation-conventions.md`](../../shared/invocation-conventions.md).** Agami slash commands: `/agami-connect`, `/agami-query`, `/agami-model`, `/agami-save-correction`, `/agami-reconcile`. (`/agami-model`'s Review tab absorbed the former `/agami-review`.) Never write the un-prefixed forms (`/save-correction`, `/init`, etc.) or colon forms (`/agami:save-correction`) — those don't exist. **`/agami-init` was folded into `/agami-connect` Phase 0a.** For chat replies, prefer natural language ("say 'save this as a correction'", "say 'remember this'") — the agami-save-correction skill's `when_to_use` matcher routes correctly.

You are recording a user correction. Goal: persist the fix so similar questions get better answers next time.

This skill does two things, in this order:

1. **Always**: append the `(question, corrected_sql)` pair to the subject area's example library at `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/prompt_examples/<area>/examples.yaml`.
2. **When applicable**: surgically update the semantic model at `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/` (a relationship/column/table edit, or a new metric) with the knowledge implied by the correction, **via the curation engine** (`semantic_model.cli curate`), which **validates** before write and reverts on failure. If the user's correction would break the model, refuse the model update (the example still gets saved).

For the model format: [`semantic_model/__init__.py`](../../../../packages/agami-core/src/semantic_model/__init__.py) (layout) + `packages/agami-core/src/semantic_model/models.py`. The curation engine is `packages/agami-core/src/semantic_model/curate.py`.
For SQL safety: [`shared/sql-generation-rules.md`](../../shared/sql-generation-rules.md).
For dialect rules: [`shared/dialect-rules.md`](../../shared/dialect-rules.md).
For DB error classification: [`shared/db_error_classifier.md`](../../shared/db_error_classifier.md).

---

## Phase −1: Plan-mode check

Run the detection + ask logic from [`shared/plan-mode-check.md`](../../shared/plan-mode-check.md). agami-save-correction needs Write (examples + model edits) and Bash (EXPLAIN-validation) — both are blocked in plan mode.

**If plan mode is active and the user picks `Stay in plan mode` (or this skill is invoked under an active plan-mode context):** refuse and end the turn. **DO NOT write a plan file. DO NOT call `ExitPlanMode`.** Refusal text (verbatim):

> I can't save corrections in plan mode — switch to **Auto** or **Edit Automatically** mode (Shift+Tab to cycle) and re-invoke. The correction won't persist otherwise.

If plan mode is not active, skip this phase silently and go to Phase 1.

---

## Phase 1: Identify the correction

### 1a — resolve the active profile and artifacts_dir

Resolve `<profile>` in this order: `AGAMI_PROFILE` env var → `active_profile` field in `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config` → literal string `"default"` (legacy fallback).

Resolve `<artifacts_dir>` per [`shared/file-layout.md → Configuring artifacts_dir`](../../shared/file-layout.md#configuring-artifacts_dir): `AGAMI_ARTIFACTS_DIR` env var → `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config.artifacts_dir` → default `$HOME/agami-artifacts`. All examples / model / datasource.md paths in this skill resolve under `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/`. USER_MEMORY.md is at `<artifacts_dir>/USER_MEMORY.md` (top-level, cross-database).

For v1.0 / v1.1 fallback paths (`<artifacts_dir>/local/<profile>.yaml`, `<artifacts_dir>/local/<profile>-examples.yaml`, `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/`), only read; never write. Migration is agami-connect's job — this skill assumes the user has already migrated by the time they're saving corrections.

### 1b — find the most recent query

Read `<artifacts_dir>/local/query_log.jsonl` and take the last entry **whose `status` is `"ok"` or absent**. Need `question` and `sql`.

The log now records every execution, not only the successful ones: an entry with `"status": "refused"` (agami declined the statement) or `"status": "failed"` (the database rejected it) carries SQL that never returned a result, so attaching a correction to it would teach the example library from a query that never ran. Entries written before the log carried a `status` field have none — treat those as `ok`.

If there is no such entry: "I don't have a recent successful query to attach this correction to. Ask the question first, then save the correction." Stop.

### 1c — get the corrected SQL

Determine what the user gave:
- **They pasted SQL** (`$ARGUMENTS` looks like a SELECT, contains `FROM` / `JOIN` / `GROUP BY`) → use directly as the corrected SQL.
- **They described what's wrong** ("the join should be on customer_id, not user_id"; "amount is in cents") → regenerate SQL using the semantic model + the original question + their feedback as additional context. Same prompt assembly as `query-database` Phase 2b.
- **No arguments and no recent feedback** → ask: "Paste the corrected SQL, or tell me what's wrong with the result."

### 1d — EXPLAIN-validate the corrected SQL

Run `EXPLAIN <sql>` (or `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN <sql>` for SQLite) via the cached database tool from `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config`. Same validate-then-save contract as `agami-connect/SKILL.md` Phase 5b:

- EXPLAIN succeeds → continue.
- EXPLAIN fails → route through [`shared/db_error_classifier.md`](../../shared/db_error_classifier.md). Surface the one-line remediation. Do **not** save anything. Ask the user to fix the SQL and try again.

Apply [`shared/sql-generation-rules.md`](../../shared/sql-generation-rules.md):
- Refuse DDL/DML (DROP, DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE, ALTER, etc.).
- Refuse system-table queries unless the user explicitly asked about schema metadata.

When the SQL was pasted rather than regenerated, EXPLAIN says only that it plans. Grade its parts with the ledger before saving: fill a row directory under `<artifacts_dir>/local/reconcile/<ts>/rows/1/` by the steps in [`shared/statement-check.md`](../../shared/statement-check.md), then read the grades per [`shared/part-ledger.md`](../../shared/part-ledger.md): a pasted statement is evidence, and a `query_defect` in it (a miscased value, a join on the wrong key) is a correction that would teach the AI a mistake.

---

## Phase 2: Always append to the examples library

Examples live per subject area at `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/prompt_examples/<area>/examples.yaml`. Pick `<area>` = the subject area whose `tables_defined` includes the table(s) the corrected SQL references (run `bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" areas "$ROOT"` and match, or `get_table_context` to confirm membership; if the SQL spans areas, use the area of the primary/driving table).

**Use the packaged writer — don't Read/Edit the YAML by hand or grep the source for its schema.** It creates the file if absent, appends, and **dedups by `question`** (a same-question correction replaces the earlier answer). One entry in a JSON array:

```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" add-example "$ROOT" --area <area> --file /tmp/agami-correction-example.json
```
```json
[{"question": "<original NL question from query_log.jsonl>", "sql": "<corrected SQL>",
  "tables": ["..."], "source": "correction", "status": "confirmed", "created_at": "<ISO8601 UTC>"}]
```
Required: `question`, `sql`. Optional scope tags (improve ranking): `tables`, `columns`, `metric`.

This phase is **non-conditional** — every correction always lands in the examples library, even if Phase 5 (model update) declines or fails.

Surface: `✓ Correction appended to <artifacts_dir>/<profile>/prompt_examples/<area>/examples.yaml.`

---

## Phase 3: Classify the correction

Compare the original SQL (from `query_log.jsonl`) to the corrected SQL. Identify what the user was teaching us, then route the correction to the right destination. **Mis-routing is the most common failure** — early-adopter feedback included three real cases where corrections landed in the wrong file:

| Category | What the user did (wrong) | What should have happened |
|---|---|---|
| Per-example commentary ("order total can be negative on #12") | Captured in `examples.yaml` `notes[]` | Field description on `ORDERS.TOTAL` (`field_metadata`) |
| Status normalization (active / ACTIVE / 1 → "Active") | `datasource.md` | `agami.choice_field` on `CUSTOMERS.STATUS` (`field_metadata`) |
| "Format counts with commas in outputs" | Captured in a markdown file as prose | `user_preference` in `USER_MEMORY.md` AND `TO_CHAR(…)` / aliases IN the seed example's SQL |

The decision tree below corrects these failures. **Walk it top to bottom — first match wins.** Don't fall back to `org_context` as a default; it's the catch-all that produces the wrong outcome in practice.

### Decision tree (top to bottom — first match wins)

```
Is the correction about a single column's MEANING, UNIT, ENCODING, or VALUE NORMALIZATION?
   (e.g., "amount is in cents", "1 means active not true", "the order total can be
    negative for refunds", "active/ACTIVE/1 all map to 'Active'", "STATUS='1' means active")
   → field_metadata
       → if it's specifically about value → canonical-display mapping, write to
         agami.choice_field on that field.
       → if it's about how the column is interpreted (unit, sign convention,
         encoding), update agami.unit + the field description prose.

Else: is the correction about a JOIN — which columns connect two tables?
   (e.g., "join on customer_id, not user_id"; "products → categories via category_id")
   → relationship

Else: is the correction about what a WHOLE TABLE represents, not one column?
   (e.g., "`orders` includes cancelled rows too", "`metrics_daily` is materialized
    from `events`, use it for date ranges > 7 days")
   → table_metadata

Else: does the corrected SQL define a REUSABLE AGGREGATION that didn't exist?
   (e.g., "MRR = SUM(price) WHERE plan_type='subscription'", "active customers
    means is_active AND last_login > 30 days ago")
   → new_metric
       → if also touches the predicate side (active customers), consider whether
         the predicate alone deserves a named_filter — same Rule 1 sign-off.

Else: is the correction a DISPLAY / FORMATTING / DEFAULT-FILTER preference?
   **Classify it like everything else — don't reflexively ask. Route to the MOST
   SPECIFIC home, structured-model-first:**
   - It's the **currency/unit** of specific column(s) — "amounts are in INR → show ₹",
     "this is a percentage", "values are in days" → set that column's **`unit`** field
     (the ISO currency code, or `percent`/`cents`/`days`) via `cli curate`
     (`{op:edit, kind:table, area, name:<table>, column:<col>, field:unit, value:"INR"}`).
     The runtime + chart renderer format it **deterministically** (`units.py`). This IS
     the org-wide home — it's in the shared model.
   - Another column fact — "amount is in cents" (a scale fix), "this code maps to
     <label>" → `field_metadata`: `value_transform` (`amount/100.0`) or `choice_field`
     on that column. Also in the shared model, org-wide.
   - It's a default filter on a table — "exclude soft-deleted", "tenancy filter" →
     the table's `default_filters` (model), via `cli curate`.
   - It's a cross-cutting presentation convention not tied to one column — "present
     money with lakh/crore grouping" → `user_preference` → `USER_MEMORY.md` (it's a
     presentation rule, not domain meaning; datasource.md is narrative-only now).
   - It's a personal stylistic tic that would hold on ANY database — "I like top-10
     not top-5", "my date format" → `user_preference` → `USER_MEMORY.md`.
   Only when you genuinely can't tell personal vs org-wide → **AskUserQuestion** (the
   ambiguity fallback below). Default a currency/unit/data fact to the **model**, not a
   prose file.
   → In all cases, if it changes how SQL renders results (TO_CHAR, ROUND, a symbol),
     ALSO bake it into the affected seed example's SQL so future answers apply it.

Else: is the correction about a BUSINESS TERM specific to this database's domain?
   (e.g., "gold tier means lifetime spend > $10k" — used as a category in many
    queries; "MRR" — the abstract concept; "we don't track refunds, those live
    in Stripe" — what the data fundamentally doesn't include)
   → org_context. A term → `cli set-terminology` (the structured `key_terminology`
     glossary). A higher-level narrative ("we don't track refunds…", "who the users
     are") → a datasource.md prose line. See the `org_context` edit section for both.
       → org_context is for ABSTRACT business concepts not tied to one specific
         column. A correction tied to a specific column belongs in field_metadata,
         NOT here. Re-check the first rule of the tree before landing here.

Else: pure SQL syntax / typo with no domain knowledge implied
   (e.g., "missed the GROUP BY", "`customer_idx` is a typo of `customer_id`")
   → sql_fix
```

### Anti-patterns the LLM keeps producing (do NOT do these)

1. **Per-column rule → datasource.md.** "`CUSTOMERS.STATUS` values normalize to Active" is NOT domain context — it's a column-value mapping. Route to `field_metadata` (`choice_field`).
2. **Per-column rule → examples.yaml notes.** This skill never writes to `examples.yaml.notes[]` (that path lives in agami-connect Phase 6d). If you find yourself wanting to write "the order total can be negative" as a note on example #12, route it to `field_metadata` on the actual column instead — the lesson applies to every future query, not just to one example.
3. **Dumping a column-fact into a prose file (or USER_MEMORY).** "Amounts are in INR → show ₹" is a fact about the `amount` column → a `caveat`/`value_transform` on that column (org-wide, structured, in the shared model) — NOT a USER_MEMORY line and NOT a datasource.md prose rule. Route data-facts to the column/table; reserve the prose files for cross-cutting conventions (datasource.md) and personal tics (USER_MEMORY). Don't reflexively ask — classify; ask only when personal-vs-org is genuinely unclear.
4. **Display preference → prose without changing SQL.** If the correction is "always format like X," ALSO modify the seed example's SQL to demonstrate the formatting (so future answers actually apply it, not just describe it).

### Diff-based hints (look at SQL changes for classification clues)

- JOIN condition changed → likely `relationship`.
- Math applied to one column (`/100`, `* 100.0`, `CAST(...)`) → likely `field_metadata` (with a `unit` correction).
- `CASE WHEN col = 'X' THEN 'Y' ELSE 'Z' END` for a column's display value → likely `field_metadata` with `choice_field` update.
- New WHERE clause referencing a specific business term (e.g., `plan_type='subscription'`) AND new aggregation → likely `new_metric`.
- `TO_CHAR(...)`, `ROUND(...)`, `AS my_alias`, a currency symbol purely on the output side → a display rule. If it's about a specific column (a currency/unit) → that column's `caveat`/`value_transform` (model, org-wide). If it's a personal style tic → `user_preference`. ALSO update the seed example's SQL either way.
- Only structural / cosmetic SQL changes → `sql_fix`.

### When ambiguous, AskUserQuestion (use the rubric above as your option set)

> What kind of correction is this?
> - **A SQL fix** — the answer was wrong but the model is fine
> - **A column meaning change** — e.g., amount is in cents, status means something specific, Male/MALE/T all map to "Male"
> - **A join correction** — relationships in the model need updating
> - **A table meaning change** — the description / context for a whole table
> - **A new business metric** — let's add this as a reusable metric
> - **A display / formatting rule** — number formatting, currency/units, default filters (currency/units attach to the column; I only ask about scope if it's genuinely unclear)
> - **Domain context for this database** — abstract business concepts not tied to one column (e.g., "gold tier means lifetime spend > $10k")

The user's answer determines Phase 5 routing.

**Distinguishing `org_context` vs `user_preference` vs `field_metadata`:**
- If the rule is tied to a specific column → `field_metadata`. **Always check this first.**
- Else ask: "would this guidance apply if I connected to a different database?" If yes → `user_preference`. If no (it's specific to this domain) → `org_context`.

### Phase 4 — surface classification + destination BEFORE Phase 5 writes anything

After classifying, **always** surface the decision to the user in chat as a one-line summary with explicit reasoning, then proceed with the edit. The contract:

```
Classification: <kind>
  → routing to: <destination file + the specific field/section that'll change>
  → reasoning: <one sentence explaining which rule of the decision tree matched>
```

Concrete examples:

```
Classification: field_metadata
  → routing to: sales/ORDERS.yaml → fields["TOTAL"].description
  → reasoning: rule says "correction about a single column's meaning/encoding/sign convention" — you're teaching that this column can be negative because refunds carry a negative sign.

Classification: field_metadata
  → routing to: sales/CUSTOMERS.yaml → fields["STATUS"].agami.choice_field
  → reasoning: rule says "value normalization mapping (active/ACTIVE/1 → 'Active') belongs in choice_field" — not datasource.md.

Classification: user_preference + seed-example update
  → routing to: USER_MEMORY.md (the prose preference) AND examples.yaml example #N (TO_CHAR in SQL)
  → reasoning: "always format counts with commas" is a display preference (cross-DB), and the seed example needs the formatting baked into its SQL so future answers actually apply it.
```

The user can override before any file is written. If they say "no, that belongs in X instead," re-route to X and re-surface the new classification before proceeding.

---

## Phase 5: Apply surgical model edits (when applicable)

If the correction kind is `sql_fix`: **stop here**. Phase 2 already saved the example. Surface the closing message and skip to Phase 6.

For every other kind, you propose a model edit and run the validator BEFORE writing.

### 4a — propose the edit

Model edits go through the curation engine (`semantic_model.cli curate "$ROOT" --ops-file …`), which validates + commits + reverts on failure — you don't stage/validate/promote by hand. `ROOT="<artifacts_dir>/<profile>"`. Resolve the subject `<area>` for an affected table the same way as Phase 2 (the area whose `tables_defined` holds it). The new-metric case uses `cli add --kind metric` (curate's `--ops-file` edits existing entries; `add` creates them) — same validate + commit + revert guarantees.

**Fixing a column/table `description` marks it human-validated.** A correction that rewrites a `description` via a curate `edit` op (no `source:"ai"`) automatically sets `description_source: "human"` — so a description agami had inferred is now trusted and stops surfacing as an "assumption" in answer receipts. You don't set `description_source` yourself; the curate engine does it.

| Edit kind | How |
|---|---|
| `relationship` | `cli curate` `edit` op(s) on the relationship in `<area>` |
| `field_metadata` | `cli curate` `edit` op(s) on the column (kind: table, + `column`) |
| `table_metadata` | `cli curate` `edit` op(s) on the table |
| `new_metric` | Write a new `subject_areas/<area>/metrics/<name>.yaml`, then `cli validate "$ROOT"` |
| `org_context` | a term → `cli set-terminology` (structured `key_terminology`, validated); a narrative line → append to `datasource.md` (no validator) |
| `user_preference` | append to `USER_MEMORY.md` (no validator) |

#### `relationship` edit

Find the relationship in `<area>`'s `relationships.yaml` (by `from_table`/`to_table`). The corrected SQL's `ON` clause tells you the fix:
- **Different columns** → `edit` op setting `from_column` / `to_column` (or, for a CAST/compound join, set `on:` and null out `from_column`/`to_column` — the "approve with fix" shape).
- **Missing relationship** → write a new entry into `relationships.yaml` (unique by from/to), with the **required** `relationship:` cardinality inferred from the join (many_to_one unless the keys are both unique), then `cli validate`.
- **Spans two areas** → it's a `cross_subject_area_relationship` (org-level `cross_subject_area_relationships.yaml`), with `from_subject_area`/`to_subject_area` + `executable`.
- **Reverses direction** → ask before flipping. Never delete a relationship unless the user explicitly says "remove the relationship".

#### `table_metadata` edit

`edit` op(s) on the table: set `description` (what the table represents) or append a `caveats[]` entry (a usage note / quirk). Never change `grain`, `columns`, `source_type`, or relationships from a table-metadata correction — those are structural.

#### `field_metadata` edit

`edit` op(s) on the column (`kind: table`, `area`, `name: <table>`, `column: <col>`):
- Set `description` ("Order amount in cents.").
- A unit / data-quality note → append a `caveats[]` entry ("Amounts in cents; divide by 100 for dollars.").
- An enum mapping ("status `1` = active, `0` = inactive") → set `choice_field`.
- A cleaning rule ("strip the brackets") → set `value_transform` (must parse as SQL — the validator checks).
Never set a column's structural identity from a field-metadata correction.

#### `new_metric` edit

Write `subject_areas/<area>/metrics/<name>.yaml` (snake_case name, unique in the area):

```yaml
name: <derived_from_user_request>
calculation: <one-sentence prose intent — REQUIRED, never empty>
bindings:
  <storage_type>: <the aggregation SQL from the corrected SQL>
source_tables: [<tables it reads>]
other_names: [<the user's term + obvious variants>]
confidence: proposed
review_state: unreviewed
```

Reference columns plainly (`<table>.<column>`). Strip user-specific WHERE filters (`WHERE customer_id = 42`); keep only definitional ones (`WHERE plan='subscription'`). Then `cli validate "$ROOT"`. A `proposed`/`unreviewed` metric needs sign-off on the `/agami-model` Review tab before the runtime will use it (Rule 1) — tell the user.

#### `user_preference` edit

A `user_preference` correction does NOT touch the semantic model. It lands in `<artifacts_dir>/USER_MEMORY.md` (per [`shared/user-memory-format.md`](../../shared/user-memory-format.md)) — the **global** preferences file that applies across every database. Steps:

1. **Read** `<artifacts_dir>/USER_MEMORY.md` (it exists — `init` seeds it).
2. **Pick the right section** (`Default filters`, `Naming and synonyms`, `Display preferences`, or `Avoid`) based on the policy's nature. Add a new section if none of the four fits — keep this rare.
3. **Append the new bullet** under that section, in plain English (the user's wording, lightly cleaned). Don't paraphrase aggressively — preserve their voice.
4. **Show the user the diff** (per Phase 4b below) before writing.
5. **Strip nothing** — USER_MEMORY.md is intentionally free-form, not schema-validated. The validator (Phase 4c) is a no-op for `user_preference` corrections; the semantic model is unchanged.

The user's bullet should be self-contained — anyone reading USER_MEMORY.md should understand the policy without seeing the original conversation.

#### `org_context` edit

`org_context` splits by **what kind of fact it is** — each goes to its proper home (per [`shared/organization-context-format.md`](../../shared/organization-context-format.md)). The two homes are deliberately separate; never write one kind into the other.

- **A term's meaning** (the common case) — "gold tier" = lifetime spend > $10k, "MRR" = monthly recurring revenue, or an acronym → its expansion. This goes to the **structured glossary**, NOT a prose file — `set-terminology` merges it onto `key_terminology` (validated, committed), and it then surfaces in the derived domain context on every query automatically (no file to re-render, nothing for a human to clobber):
  ```bash
  printf '{"gold tier": "lifetime spend > $10k"}' > /tmp/agami-term.json
  bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" set-terminology "$ROOT" --file /tmp/agami-term.json
  ```
  The key is the term; the value is a **self-contained** definition (understandable without the original conversation). It merges by default — existing terms are never lost. **Never** hand-append `- "term" = definition` lines to datasource.md; that's the old prose home and is wrong now.
- **A higher-level narrative** — what the data represents, who the users are, what's *not* in this database. Append a sentence/paragraph to `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/datasource.md` under `# About this database` (create it with the starter if missing — `cli org-draft "$ROOT" > "$ROOT/datasource.md"`). This file is the human narrative **only** — no `term = definition` lines, no model facts.
- **A cross-cutting display/formatting convention** (a currency symbol or number grouping everyone querying this DB should see) is a *presentation* preference, not domain meaning: route it to `user_preference` → `USER_MEMORY.md`, or — when it's really a fact about one column (units/currency) — to that column's `caveat`/`value_transform`. Do **not** invent a datasource.md "conventions" heading; the file is narrative-only.

**Show the user the diff** (Phase 4b) before writing. `set-terminology` is validated (reverts on failure); datasource.md prose is free-form (no validation).

#### `mixed` edit

Apply each individual edit as above. Show the user the combined diff in 4b before validating. If the mix includes a `user_preference` or `org_context`, those parts skip the validator (USER_MEMORY.md / datasource.md aren't validated); the semantic-model parts still go through the validator.

### 4b — show the diff to the user, get approval

Build a unified diff (or a compact "before / after" summary) of the proposed change against the existing target file. Name the file in the prompt so the user knows what they're approving. Show via AskUserQuestion:

> I want to update the target file in `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/subject_areas/<area>/:
>
> ```
> [Relationship] orders_to_customers
> - from_columns: [user_id]
> + from_columns: [customer_id]
> ```
>
> Approve?
> - **Yes (Recommended)** — apply and validate
> - **No** — leave the model as-is, the example is still saved
> - **Edit first** — let me tweak before applying

For `org_context` / `user_preference` the file is `datasource.md` / `USER_MEMORY.md` instead of a schema yaml — same prompt shape, just a different filename.

Always include the validator step in 4c regardless of which option they pick (since "Yes" still has to validate, except for datasource.md / USER_MEMORY.md which aren't validated).

### 4c — apply with validation (the gate)

**For `relationship` / `field_metadata` / `table_metadata` edits** (existing entries): build the ops array, **write it with the Write tool** (never a heredoc / shell variable / `python3 -c` — JSON quotes and `null` break those), then apply via the curation engine — it validates the whole model, commits to the profile git repo, logs to `curation_log.jsonl`, and **reverts every change if validation fails**:

```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" curate "$ROOT" --ops-file /tmp/agami-correction-ops.json
```

Stdout: `{applied, skipped, errors, validated, committed}`.
- `validated: true` → surface `✓ Model updated and validated.`
- `validated: false` → the engine already reverted; surface `errors` verbatim: "Your correction would break the model — here's what's wrong: …. The example is saved either way; the model wasn't updated."

**For `new_metric`** (creating an entry): use the packaged `add` command — don't hand-write the YAML. It validates the item + the whole tree, writes `subject_areas/<area>/metrics/<slug>.yaml`, reverts on failure, and commits. Put the one metric in a JSON array:

```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" add "$ROOT" --kind metric --area <area> --file /tmp/agami-new-metric.json
```
Same `{applied, skipped, errors, validated, committed}` contract as above: `validated: false` → it already reverted, surface `errors`; `skipped` → the metric was structurally invalid (e.g. missing `calculation`), surface the reason.

There is no override path — a model that fails validation is never persisted; `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/` is left unchanged. The example library still got the correction (Phase 2 already happened).

For `org_context` / `user_preference` corrections (datasource.md / USER_MEMORY.md only): no validator step. Write the file directly with `chmod 600`.

### 4d — confirmation

```
✓ Correction appended to <artifacts_dir>/<profile>/prompt_examples/<area>/examples.yaml
✓ Model updated in <artifacts_dir>/<profile>/subject_areas/<area>/:
    - relationship orders_to_customers from_columns: [user_id] → [customer_id]
✓ Validator passed.

Next time someone asks "<question>" or anything similar, I'll use the corrected SQL AND know the right join is on customer_id.
```

(Phase 6 — telemetry emission on correction — has been removed in the current 0.x line. The skill no longer reads `analytics_consent` and no longer appends to `.telemetry-queue.jsonl`. agami has no telemetry — see `docs/privacy.md`.)

## Edge cases

- **Empty examples file** — initialize it with the new entry as the only one.
- **`examples.yaml` missing** — invoke `agami-connect` first to seed, then append.
- **User pastes SQL referencing tables not in the model** — EXPLAIN-validate catches it (`table_not_found`); surface the remediation, don't save.
- **User saves a duplicate of an existing seed** — replace the seed (`source: correction`, fresh `created_at`).
- **Most-recent query is itself a correction** — that's fine, attach to it.
- **Validator fails on a model edit but the user really wants it saved** — they can hand-edit `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/<schema>.yaml` directly and the next `query-database` will (try to) read it. The validator runs again from `connect verify` if they want to confirm. There is no "skip validation" path from this skill.
- **User says "actually undo my last correction"** — they hand-edit the YAML / Markdown files; this skill doesn't track an undo log in v1.
- **Edit affects datasets in two different schemas** — split into two separate edits, one per target file. The validator runs once per write (or once for the merged directory).

## Hard rules

1. **Phase 2 (examples append) always runs.** Even if the user later changes their mind on the model edit, the example is already saved.
2. **Phase 5 model writes are gated by the validator.** `cli curate` (edits existing entries) and `cli add` (creates a new metric/entity) are the only ways to write inside `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/`, and both refuse / revert on a validation failure. No exceptions. datasource.md and USER_MEMORY.md edits skip the validator (free-form Markdown).
3. **Edits stay valid against the model.** Don't invent fields — the Pydantic models (`packages/agami-core/src/semantic_model/models.py`) forbid unknown keys, so an invalid edit is rejected by the validator. When you can't express a correction within the model shape, fall back to `sql_fix` (example only) and tell the user "I can save this as a few-shot example but it doesn't fit a model edit."
4. **Show the diff before mutating the model.** The user always gets to see and approve the proposed change.
