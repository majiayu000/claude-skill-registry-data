description: >-
  Use when three or more AI agents are available and a task needs coordinated execution, or when work
  must be handed to another agent, session or tool. It ships the coordination rules as ENFORCED
  invariants rather than advice: one writer per resource (a conflicting claim is refused and names
  the holder), a verifier that is never the implementer and whose PASS must carry criterion-linked
  evidence, a failed verification that blocks both done and dispatch to evidence, three failed rounds
  that block the task outright, an external action that cannot be dispatched until an approval
  covering it is recorded, a domain review by a third party for consequential work, rigorous E1-E4
  evidence grading with enforced floors, capability-scored role assignment from a roster of any size
  (any agent names), a shared handoff record with a checker, a dependency-free task-queue CLI, an
  important-task intake gate, and a coordination anti-pattern guide. One command - scripts/gate.mjs -
  runs sixteen checks and injects twelve known faults it must reject before reporting PASS. Activation is
  configurable: global, keyword-triggered (three-valued: engage / surface / silent), or manual.

  Do not use for: container or infrastructure orchestration (k8s, docker-compose, service meshes),
  ordinary job queues and schedulers, comparing or evaluating AI models against each other, or
  splitting work between people. Those share vocabulary with this skill and none of them is
  multi-agent coordination.

# Agent Orchestra

> 中文对照（不随 skill 常驻加载）：`references/zh-contrast.md`

One protocol for two axes of multi-agent work:

- **In-task coordination** - who does what right now, who may write, who verifies, and what counts as done.
- **Cross-session handoff** - how the state survives when the work moves to another agent, another session or another tool.

Both axes share the same hard rules: one writer per resource, a verifier that is never the implementer, graded evidence, and a shared record that outranks any scheduler. It makes coordination failures visible and recoverable. It cannot promise infallibility, and it never replaces user authorization.


## Activation (when to use this skill)

Configure in `config/agents.example.yaml` under `activation:`.

| mode | behavior | token cost |
|---|---|---|
| global | engages for every task | highest (always loaded) |
| keyword | engages only when task text matches keywords | default; low |
| manual | engages only when the user explicitly invokes it | lowest |

1. Read the activation block from `config/agents.example.yaml`.
2. global -> engage. manual -> engage only when the user asked for multi-agent work or a handoff.
3. keyword -> run `node scripts/detect-trigger.mjs --text "<task text>"` and read the exit code:

| exit | label | meaning | what to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | ENGAGED | a curated, self-anchored keyword phrase matched **and** no comparison marker is present | use the skill |
| **3** | POSSIBLE | coordination phrasing without such a keyword - including every comparison request that also describes coordinating work | decide from the sentence yourself, or ask - **do not treat it as a hit or a miss** |
| **1** | NOT_ENGAGED | no signal, an exclude keyword, or a plain comparison ("评估这两个模型的准确率") | stay silent |

Exit 3 exists because seven adversarial verification rounds proved that no word list or character
window can separate those two readings; each patch simply moved the hole. So the filter does not
guess. It decides the unambiguous cases and **surfaces** the rest.

Exclude keywords win over any hit.

What the keyword layer is, honestly: a **conservative deterministic filter**, not a full
understanding of intent. Unambiguous phrases engage on their own. Anything a pattern catches must
also satisfy a **conjunction**: the sentence has to name an agent-ish subject (an agent word, a
model name) **and** describe an act of coordinating. That conjunction is what keeps
"两个同事同时改同一个文件" and "两个实习生互相覆盖对方的代码" silent - they share the phrasing and
the vocabulary, and they are people, not agents. A sentence-level veto then removes requests that
are really about comparing or choosing between models.

Adversarial verification rounds kept breaking earlier versions of this table; every case they
found is now a permanent entry in `scripts/activation-cases.json`, which the acceptance test and
any verification script both read. What the
layer does NOT do is understand arbitrary phrasing: an unusual way of asking may stay silent, and
that is the intended failure direction - one missed phrase costs a nudge, a false engage
reorganises work that has nothing to do with agents. The description above is what the host model
routes on, and an explicit request always wins: if a user says to use this skill, no keyword check
applies.


## Seven non-negotiables

1. **One primary writer per file or resource.** Everyone else is read-only or writes isolated artifacts until a recorded handoff promotes them.
2. **Verifier != implementer.** The verifier is the best-suited eligible agent by capability score, never a fixed name, and never the agent who wrote the code. A self-check is E3, not a verification result.
3. **The verification gate cannot be walked past.** A failed verification returns the task to `implement`; the task can then neither reach `done` nor be dispatched to `evidence` until a verify passes or a human records an override with an approver, a scope and a reason. The failed result stays on the record.
4. **Read before acting; resume instead of redoing; write progress down before switching.** Any agent picking up a task reads the shared record first and continues from the recorded step.
5. **No completion claim without criterion-linked evidence.** "I checked" is not evidence. See `references/evidence-grading.md`.
6. **Irreversible actions need separate, explicit user approval.** Deploy, publish, send, upload, delete, account changes: the approval is recorded (`orchestrator.mjs approve`). *A passed verification is not a shipping authorization.*
7. **The human-readable shared record outranks the queue.** If the record and the queue disagree, stop and follow the record; the queue is a scheduler, not the authority on intent.

## Important-task intake gate

Applies to any task marked important - and to every **L3** task, because consequential work is
important by definition. An external action is always L3, so it is covered twice over.

Before the **first write, first dispatch or first verification** of an important task, ask the user and record three choices - never default them:

1. Execute solo, or start collaborative mode?
2. Run the security scan, or skip it?
3. Run an independent verification pass, or skip it?

"Important" includes at least: multi-file or architectural change, user-facing/product delivery, production/outreach/publish/deploy, data migration or deletion, permission/credential/security change, costly scanning, cross-agent collaboration, or any task the user calls high-quality/fully verified. When the boundary is unclear, treat it as important.

The gate decides *how* work is coordinated. It does **not** authorize irreversible actions. See `references/important-task-intake.md`.


## Fast path

1. Inventory each agent's tools, model, workspace, permissions, specialties, cost tier and availability.
2. Score capabilities against roles; never infer a role from an agent's name.
3. Classify the task: routine / important / critical.
4. Write a compact task packet: objective, non-goals, ownership, risks, acceptance tests, owner, verifier.
5. Take the ownership lock before editing.
6. Run the pipeline `specify -> implement -> verify -> evidence -> done`; important work requires an independent verifier, critical work adds domain review and approval.
7. Stop on failed gates, ownership conflicts, missing evidence or unapproved external actions.

## Roster: three or more agents, any names

Roles are assigned from a **roster**, which is data, not code. Three agents work; so do five, eight or twelve, and the agents can be called anything at all - nothing depends on an agent being named `coordinator` or `verifier`:

```yaml
agents:
  planner: { cost: 2, specialties: [],       scores: { specify: 3, implement: 1, verify: 1, evidence: 3 } }
  builder: { cost: 4, specialties: [full],   scores: { specify: 1, implement: 3, verify: 1, evidence: 1 } }
  webhand: { cost: 5, specialties: [web],    scores: { specify: 1, implement: 2, verify: 1, evidence: 1 } }
  auditor: { cost: 6, specialties: [verify], scores: { specify: 1, implement: 1, verify: 3, evidence: 2 } }
  scribe:  { cost: 1, specialties: [],       scores: { specify: 1, implement: 1, verify: 0, evidence: 3 } }
routes:                      # optional: anything omitted is resolved by score
  specify: planner
  evidence: scribe
  implement: { build: builder, web: webhand }
```

- Scores are 0-3 per role. Selection is deterministic and reproducible: **highest score -> capability match in `specialties` -> lower `cost` -> agent id order**. `available: false` parks an agent without deleting it.
- Stage owners come from `routes` when the roster names one, otherwise from the score. A roster that can fill no agent for a stage is rejected loudly, never routed by accident.
- Install a roster of your own with `orchestrator.mjs init --roster <file.json>`. Adding an agent is a data edit: declare it, score it, it joins selection.


## Roles and ownership

| Role | Owns |
|---|---|
| Coordinator | decomposition, state, conflict resolution, accepting evidence |
| Implementation worker | edits assigned resources only |
| Verification worker | independent reproduction, boundary and regression checks (never the implementer) |
| Environment specialist | runtime, MCP, build, toolchain diagnosis |
| Domain reviewer | UX, content, security, legal or other domain criteria |

One agent may hold several roles on **routine** work only. Important work requires an independent verifier; critical work adds a domain reviewer and human approval. Ownership conflicts are resolved by stopping, not by racing: the last timestamped entry in the shared record wins.

See `references/roles.md` and `references/routing-and-roles.md`.

## Rigor: how much verification this change has to carry

Rigor is chosen from the **blast radius** of the change, not from how interesting it is, and it
decides which activities are mandatory - the way an integrity level selects V&V tasks in
IEEE 1012. State it; do not infer it. The engine stores it per task (`--rigor`) and enforces it.

| Level | Applies when | Mandatory |
|---|---|---|
| **L1 local** | one file, no shared interface, reversible | tests for the change; self-produced evidence allowed (never E1) |
| **L2 shared** (default) | multiple files, shared config, or user-visible behaviour | verifier must differ from the implementer; positive **and** negative cases; evidence graded E1 or E2 |
| **L3 consequential** | irreversible, published, deployed, or touching credentials/permissions | independent verification, a machine-produced artifact, an approval record (approver + scope + reason), **E1 evidence**, and a kept failure record |

Two rules the engine enforces rather than trusting: an **external action can never be filed as
L1** (it leaves the machine), and an **L3 task cannot reach `done` without E1 evidence** - a
command, its exit code and the revision it applies to.


See `references/verification-standard.md` for the ten requirements this is derived from.

## Verification gate

Verification is a gate in the same sense as a security scan, except it is run by **an agent from your own team, chosen for the job** - no external tool and no particular vendor is required:

- the verifier is the highest-scoring eligible agent for `verify`, and the implementer is **never** eligible (if nobody is scored above 0, the run fails closed instead of pretending);
- completing the `verify` stage is a PASS; `fail` records the failing criteria and sends the task back to `implement` - the verifier never fixes the work itself;
- the gate blocks two things: reaching `done` from `evidence`, and being dispatched to `evidence` at all;
- a human can override deliberately with `override --task <id> --by <who> --scope <what> --reason <why>` - all three are required, and the failed result is kept next to the override rather than erased.


## Handoff: the shared record

When the work moves - another session, another tool, another day - the state moves through a **shared record**, not through chat history:

| File | Holds | Updated |
|---|---|---|
| `CURRENT-TASK.md` | the live handoff entry: status, owner, progress, next step, evidence | on every substantial step |
| `HANDOFF-RULES.md` | the team's rules of engagement | when rules change |
| `MEMORY-SNAPSHOT.md` | shared decisions, preferences, lessons | periodically / on big decisions |
| `AGENT-ROLES.md` | who can do what | when the roster changes |

The five iron rules, in order: **read before acting**, **resume instead of redoing**, **write progress down**, **hand off before switching**, **completion carries graded evidence**. A task waiting to be picked up is `handoff-wait`; a task stuck on a condition names that condition and is only marked `blocked` after three rounds.

The record is the authority on intent; the queue is the scheduler. When they disagree, the record wins and the queue is reconciled to it.


Full detail, including the cross-tool checklist and the memory sync routine: `references/handoff.md`.

## Pipeline and queue

The specify stage cannot end without its **work products**: `--spec` (what is being built) and
`--acceptance` (how it will be judged), optionally `--non-goals`. A task that cannot state both is
not ready to implement, and the engine refuses the transition instead of letting work drift into
something nobody can falsify later.

Stage machine: `specify -> implement -> verify -> evidence -> done`, plus `blocked` and `recovery`.

```bash
node scripts/orchestrator/orchestrator.mjs init --roster my-team.json         # 3, 5 or 12 agents
node scripts/orchestrator/orchestrator.mjs create --title "Fix checkout" --type build --workspace "<workspace>" \
  --resources "src/checkout.ts,src/cart.ts" --rigor L2                             # one writer per RESOURCE
node scripts/orchestrator/orchestrator.mjs claim  --task task-0001 --agent implementer-a
node scripts/orchestrator/orchestrator.mjs dispatch --task task-0001          # dry-run command only
node scripts/orchestrator/orchestrator.mjs fail   --task task-0001 --agent verifier-b --criteria "test X fails"
node scripts/orchestrator/orchestrator.mjs override --task task-0001 --by user --scope "release 2.1" --reason "pre-existing flake"
node scripts/orchestrator/orchestrator.mjs approve --task task-0002 --by user --scope "deploy to production"
```

- `dispatch` prints the command to run and an `argv` array; it never launches an agent. Prefer `argv` over pasting the command line into a shell.
- A non-dispatchable task (blocked, gated, no assignee, no command) fails with a non-zero exit code. Exit 0 must never disguise an undispatchable task.
- **An external action cannot be dispatched until it is approved**, and the approval names an approver and a scope.
- **A resource is held by one live task at a time.** Declare `--resources`; a claim that overlaps a held
  resource is refused and names the holder. The lock is per stage, so completing a stage frees it.
- **A verification PASS must carry its witness.** The record is stored on the verification itself, not as
  evidence authored by the verifier, so L3's "the verifier produced none of the evidence" still holds.
- **Three failed verifications block the task** for a coordinator to recover, instead of retrying forever.
- `approve` is the only path for external actions, per task and per scope; `fail` closes the verification gate; `override` is the only way past it.

See `references/task-queue.md` and `scripts/orchestrator/README.md`.

## Evidence grading

| Grade | Meaning | Allowed wording |
|---|---|---|
| E1 reproducible | command output, exit code, hash, screenshot, URL response | "verified: `<command>` exited 0, output ..." |
| E2 same-system peer check | another agent re-ran it and gave reproduction steps | "peer-checked by <agent> (steps attached): ..." |
| E3 self-assertion | the author says it looks fine | "**self-checked, not independently verified**: ..." |
| E4 planned | not executed yet | "planned verification: ..." |

Never let E3 speak in E1's voice. Same-system peer checks are not independent verification. Grades do not survive a revision change: after an edit, a resumed session or context compaction, re-verify before restating an old "verified".

The engine enforces this rather than trusting the wording: a bare string handed to
`complete --evidence "..."` is stored as **E3 with a note saying it was downgraded**, and
`--evidence-grade E1` is refused unless it also carries `--evidence-command`,
`--evidence-exit-code` and `--evidence-revision`. Grade labels are not decoration - an
ungraded sentence cannot borrow E1's voice because it is not allowed to carry the label.

See `references/evidence-grading.md` and `references/verification-standard.md`.

## Token and cost policy

Load only the reference section you need. One coordinator summary instead of full transcripts. Bounded structured packets. Parallelize read-only checks; serialize dependent work and writes. Cheap models for discovery and mechanical checks; strong models for ambiguity, architecture, adversarial review and acceptance. Never compress requirements, code, paths, URLs, hashes, errors, permissions or evidence.

See `references/token-efficiency.md`.

## Completion gate

Do not claim done, verified or deployed without criterion-linked evidence. User-facing work should test the actual runtime, target environments, core interactions, errors, keyboard/accessibility where relevant, resource loading, and reduced-motion/fallback behaviour. A failed gate returns the task to its responsible stage. A passed gate is not a shipping authorization.

## Stop conditions

Ownership conflict; unrecoverable baseline; material ambiguity; release-blocking finding; missing evidence; a request for secrets; an external action without recorded approval; a verifier that was also the implementer; a shared record and queue that disagree.

## Anti-patterns (read before forming a team)

| # | Pitfall | Symptom | Engineering fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Context explosion | the shared transcript grows until early constraints and acceptance criteria fall out of the window | the shared record stores conclusions and state only (<=200 lines); process chat stays local; the coordinator re-sends the minimal necessary context each batch |
| 2 | Hallucination contagion | one member's wrong output spreads as fact through shared memory | partition shared memory: entries become visible only after the coordinator marks them verified; unverified content stays quarantined with source and confidence |
| 3 | Coordination deadlock | A waits for B, B for C, C for A; the system hangs forever | queue resource requests in a globally fixed order; every wait carries a timeout (default 15 min) that escalates to the coordinator |
| 4 | State divergence | two members disagree about task state; work is repeated or dropped | single source of truth = the shared record's state machine; state changes are written to disk; verbal/session state does not count |
| 5 | Communication storm | members message each other; links grow quadratically with headcount | hub-and-spoke: members talk to the coordinator only; coordination is relayed |
| 6 | Agent sprawl | roles are split until boundaries overlap and nobody owns the outcome | subtraction first: a new role must justify why it cannot fold into an existing loop; every role owns an end-to-end deliverable |
| 7 | Dispatch left to LLM improvisation | the same input routes differently twice; work is slow or skipped | make dispatch deterministic: board scan + fixed rules; the LLM plans, it does not mechanically distribute |
| 8 | No acceptance aggregation | each member delivers, nobody assembles and checks; defects surface at integration | the coordinator runs an independent acceptance gate against every criterion with runtime evidence; failing batches are returned whole |

### Hard red lines

- Never let two members write the same file at the same time.
- Never start work or deliver outside the shared record and the queue.
- Never treat "I think it is done" as done - runtime evidence is required.
- Never let members hand tasks to each other privately; all dispatch flows through the coordinator.
- Never let an implementer certify its own work.
