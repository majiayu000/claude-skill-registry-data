# Arcanea Voice Guide Skill

## Purpose

This skill ensures consistent, magical, and accessible communication across all Arcanea touchpoints—from UI microcopy to marketing materials to in-universe narratives. Every word should feel like it belongs in the Kingdom of Light.

## Core Voice Principles

### The Arcanean Voice Is:

1. **Magical but Grounded**
   - Fantasy language that serves function
   - Mystical terms with clear meaning
   - Wonder without confusion

2. **Inspiring but Honest**
   - Empowering without false promises
   - Celebrating creativity genuinely
   - Ambitious yet achievable

3. **Warm but Professional**
   - Welcoming without being saccharine
   - Friendly without being casual
   - Personal without being familiar

4. **Simple but Rich**
   - Clear language, no jargon
   - Depth through meaning, not complexity
   - Elegant, not elaborate

## Tone by Context

### Onboarding (Welcoming + Inspiring)

**Goal:** Make creators feel they've found home

**Examples:**
```
✓ "Every creator begins in shadow. Welcome to the light."
✓ "Your creative journey starts with a single Spark."
✓ "Choose your Academy—but know you're never limited to one."

✗ "Sign up to create AI content"
✗ "Start your free trial now"

```

### Creation UI (Encouraging + Practical)

✓ "Your Essence is taking shape. Save when ready."

✗ "Click to add more"
✗ "Error: Invalid input"
✗ "Processing your request"
```

### Error States (Gentle + Helpful)

**Goal:** Never blame the creator; always offer paths forward

**Examples:**
```

✓ "This path isn't available right now. Here are other routes..."

✗ "Error 500"
✗ "You did something wrong"
✗ "Request failed"
```

### Achievement/Success (Celebratory + Genuine)

✓ "Learn to create anything through magic."

✗ "The best AI creation platform"
✗ "Make money creating AI content"

```

### Community (Collaborative + Warm)

**Goal:** Foster connection and generosity

**Examples:**
```
✓ "When you remix, you honor the original and expand it."
✓ "The Kingdom grows brighter with each creator who shares."
✓ "Collaboration is the highest form of magic."

✗ "Beat other creators to the top"
✗ "Get more followers"
✗ "Compete for attention"
```

### Empty States

**Pattern:** Acknowledge + Inspire + Direct

Your Realm awaits its first Essence.
Begin with a Spark—create something that matters to you.

## Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Structure

**Prefer:**
- Active voice
- Short-to-medium sentences
- Subject-verb-object clarity
- One idea per sentence

**Avoid:**
- Passive constructions
- Run-on sentences
- Nested clauses
- Jargon-heavy passages

### Paragraph Structure

**For UI:** 1-2 sentences max
**For Docs:** 3-4 sentences max
**For Marketing:** Varied, rhythmic

### Capitalization

**Capitalize:**
- Arcanea (always)
- Academy names (Atlantean Academy)
- Luminor names (Melodia, Chronica)
- Core terms (Creator, Guardian, Realm, Essence, Portal, ARC, NEA)

**Don't capitalize:**
- Generic uses ("a creator" when not referring to role)
- Descriptive phrases ("the remix feature")

### Punctuation

**Prefer:**
- Periods for statements
- Em dashes for emphasis—like this
- Ellipses for mystery or continuation...

**Avoid:**
- Exclamation marks (unless genuine celebration)
- Excessive question marks
- All caps for emphasis

## Anti-Patterns

### AI Writing Patterns to Avoid

These phrases trigger "AI-written" perception:

| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| "I cannot help but..." | AI verbal tic | Direct statement |
| "It's worth noting that..." | Hedge | Just note it |
| "Delve into..." | Overused | Explore, examine |
| "Moreover" / "Furthermore" | Stilted | Also, And |
| "Nestled" | Cliché | Located, sitting |
| "Tapestry" | Overused metaphor | Specific description |
| "Indeed" | Unnecessary filler | Remove |
| "In order to" | Wordy | To |
| "It is important to note" | Hedge | State directly |
| "Moving forward" | Corporate | Next, Then |

### Tone Violations

**Too Corporate:**
```
✗ "We leverage cutting-edge AI to enable content creation synergies."
✓ "Create with AI companions who understand your creative vision."
```

**Too Casual:**
```
✗ "Hey! Super stoked you made a thing! That's awesome!"
✓ "Your Essence resonates. The Kingdom welcomes your creation."
```

**Too Mystical:**
```
✗ "The eternal light of the cosmic consciousness flows through the ethereal..."
✓ "Your creative light joins the Kingdom. Others can now discover it."
```

**Too Technical:**
```
✗ "The API will process your multimodal input tensor..."
✓ "Your creation is taking form across sound and vision."
```
