# auth-md

Generate, validate, and explain the **auth.md** protocol — the open standard that lets AI agents register for services on behalf of users, without signup forms.

---

## Protocol Context

auth.md is a Markdown file published at a service's root (typically `https://service.com/auth.md`) that instructs agents on how to register. It works simultaneously as human-readable documentation and as a discoverable runtime artifact for agents.

The protocol extends RFC 9728 (OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata) with an `agent_auth` block in the Authorization Server metadata. Registration returns an `identity_assertion` (service-signed JWT) that the agent exchanges at `/oauth2/token` for an `access_token`. Three registration methods are supported:

| Flow | Mechanism | When to use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **identity_assertion** | Provider signs an ID-JAG (with `auth_time`) asserting user identity. Service verifies JWKS, returns `identity_assertion`. Agent exchanges at `/oauth2/token`. | Service does JIT provisioning from OIDC/SAML; wants zero-friction registration. |
| **service_auth** | Email hint + browser-based ceremony. Agent receives `user_code` + `verification_uri`; user signs in and types code. Agent polls `/oauth2/token`. | Agents on platforms that can't mint ID-JAGs; self-serve without trust list. |
| **anonymous** | No identity upfront. Immediate `identity_assertion` with pre-claim scopes. Optional deferred claim for scope upgrade. | Agent needs basic access immediately; human ownership binding deferred. |

### Protocol Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` | Discovery — resource metadata (RFC 9728) |
| `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | Discovery — AS metadata with `agent_auth` block |
| `POST /agent/identity` | Registration — dispatches on `type` field |
| `POST /agent/identity/claim` | Claim initiation (anonymous deferred, or re-initiate expired user_code) |
| `POST /oauth2/token` | Token exchange (JWT-bearer grant) + claim polling (claim grant) |
| `POST /oauth2/revoke` | Credential-layer revocation (RFC 7009) |
| `events_endpoint` | Registration-layer revocation (receives SETs, RFC 8935) |

### Token Lifecycle

Registration **never** returns an `access_token` directly. The flow is:

1. Registration → `identity_assertion` (service-signed JWT, reusable until expiry)
2. Exchange → `POST /oauth2/token` with `grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` → `access_token`
3. Refresh → re-exchange same `identity_assertion` when access_token expires
4. Expired assertion → restart at registration (Step 3)

### Claim Ceremony (v2 — Browser-Based)

The claim ceremony uses RFC 8628-style device authorization:
1. Registration returns `user_code` + `verification_uri` in a `claim` block
2. Agent surfaces both to the user
3. User opens `verification_uri`, signs in to the service, types the 6-digit code
4. Agent polls `POST /oauth2/token` with `grant_type=urn:workos:agent-auth:grant-type:claim` + `claim_token`
5. On success: receives `access_token` + fresh `identity_assertion`

## Operation Modes

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | `generate` | `generate` = create auth.md + metadata; `validate` = check existing auth.md; `explain` = explain the protocol |
| `validation_level` | `basic` | `basic` = structure + fields + consistency (offline); `full` = basic + live endpoint fetch |
| `flows` | `all` | Which flows to include: `identity_assertion`, `service_auth`, `anonymous`, `all` |
| `role` | `app` | Perspective: `app` = service accepting registrations; `provider` = platform minting ID-JAGs |

---

## Workflow: Generate

### 1. Scan the codebase

Look for:
- Existing API routes and authentication patterns
- Defined scopes/permissions
- Framework (Express, Django, Rails, FastAPI, NestJS, etc.)
- Base URL and auth server URL configuration
- Existing authentication middleware
- User models and provisioning mechanisms

### 2. Ask the user only what cannot be inferred

- Which flows to support (identity_assertion, service_auth, anonymous, or combination)
- Pre-claim scopes vs post-claim scopes (if anonymous)
- Trusted agent providers and trust list policy (if identity_assertion)
- Whether the service already does JIT provisioning or requires manual onboarding
- `idJagMaxAuthAgeSeconds` value (default: 3600)
- Desired rate limiting policy

### 3. Generate artifacts

Produce three artifacts:

**a) `auth.md`** — Markdown file following the protocol template (see `references/protocol-template.md`). Must contain:
- Title and intro addressed to the agent
- Step 1 — Discover (two hops: PRM → AS metadata)
- Step 2 — Pick a method (decision tree)
- Step 3 — Register (one subsection per supported method)
- Step 4 — Claim ceremony (if service_auth or anonymous with claim)
- Step 5 — Exchange the assertion (POST /oauth2/token with jwt-bearer grant)
- Step 6 — Use the access_token
- Errors (complete table with all applicable codes)
- Revocation (two layers)

**b) `oauth-protected-resource.json`** — JSON for `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` with `resource_name` and `resource_logo_uri`

**c) `oauth-authorization-server.json`** — JSON for `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` with:
- `issuer`, `token_endpoint`, `revocation_endpoint`, `grant_types_supported`
- Complete `agent_auth` block with `identity_endpoint`, `claim_endpoint`, `events_endpoint`

### 4. Generate implementation guidance

"Next Steps" section with:
- How to serve `auth.md` at the domain root
- How to serve metadata at the well-known paths
- How to add `WWW-Authenticate` header to 401 responses
- Endpoint implementation guidance (without generating framework-specific code unless requested)
- Token exchange implementation at `/oauth2/token`
- Claim page hosting (verification_uri → login → code input → confirm)
- Recommended rate limiting configuration
- Recommended audit events
- Security considerations (token hashing, auth_time validation, replay protection, claim_token handling)

### 5. Generate Agent Provider guide (if role=provider)

When the user is an agent provider (not an app), generate:
- How to mint audience-specific ID-JAGs with `auth_time`
- Token structure (header + payload with required and optional claims)
- How to publish JWKS
- Optionally: how to publish a CIMD (Client ID Metadata Document)
- How to implement revocation (POST SET to events_endpoint)
- How to present consent to the user before asserting identity (using `resource_name` + `resource_logo_uri`)

---

## Workflow: Validate

### 1. Load the auth.md

From a local file path or URL.

### 2. Run validation at the requested level

**Basic (offline):**
- All required headings present (Step 1–6, Errors, Revocation)
- At least one flow documented
- Valid JSON in fenced code blocks for request/response shapes
- AS metadata contains `identity_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`, `grant_types_supported`
- Error table with standard error codes
- Consistency: flows in prose match `identity_types_supported` in metadata JSON
- No unreplaced placeholders

**Full (live):**
- All basic checks, plus:
- Fetch `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` from the declared base URL
- Verify `agent_auth` block exists in AS metadata
- Fetch `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and verify consistency
- Check that `identity_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`, `revocation_endpoint` respond (accept 400/401/422, reject 404/405)
- Verify API returns 401 with `WWW-Authenticate` containing `resource_metadata`

### 3. Report results

Checklist with ✅/❌ per rule, grouped by category:
- **Structure** — headings and order
- **Fields** — required fields in JSONs
- **Consistency** — cross-references between prose and metadata
- **Format** — valid JSON, valid HTTP, no placeholders
- **Endpoints** (full only) — reachability and correct responses

Include severity: 🔴 Error (agents will fail), 🟡 Warning (degraded experience), 🟢 Info (suggestion).

See `references/validation-rules.md` for the complete ruleset.

---

## Workflow: Explain

When the user wants to understand the protocol without generating or validating:

1. Identify what the user wants to know (overview, specific flow, specific endpoint, security, etc.)
2. Explain using the protocol context above and the references
3. Use text-based sequence diagrams when helpful
4. Point to official documentation when relevant

---

## User Matching and JIT Provisioning

The identity_assertion flow needs to decide which service user a registration represents. Recommended resolution order:

1. **Delegation record match** — if `(iss, sub)` has a delegation on file, route to same user
2. **Verified email match** — if a user exists with same verified email BUT no `(iss, sub)` delegation → `interaction_required` (401) with claim block for user to confirm linking
3. **Verified phone match** — same pattern
4. **No match → JIT** — create a new user per provisioning policy, or refuse

Reject ID-JAGs with neither a verified email nor a verified phone — there's no basis for matching.

---

## Rate Limiting

The `/agent/identity` endpoint is unauthenticated for anonymous registration. Implement two tiers:

1. **Per-IP** (checked first) — prevents a single source from consuming the tenant's budget. Default: 5/hour anonymous, 60/hour identity_assertion.
2. **Per-tenant** (checked second) — global cap across IPs. Default: 100/hour anonymous, 1000/hour identity_assertion.

Also rate-limit `/oauth2/token` polling — enforce `interval` from the claim block, reject with `slow_down` if too fast.

---

## Recommended Audit Events

| Event | When | Data |
|-------|------|------|
| `registration.created` | Successful POST /agent/identity | registration_id, registration_type, iss, sub |
| `registration.interaction_required` | 401 interaction_required | registration_id, iss, sub, matched_user_id |
| `registration.login_required` | 401 login_required | iss, sub, auth_time, max_age |
| `claim.initiated` | /agent/identity/claim called | registration_id, email |
| `claim.completed` | User submitted correct user_code | registration_id, claimed_by_user_id |
| `claim.expired` | user_code window or registration expired | registration_id |
| `token.exchanged` | /oauth2/token jwt-bearer success | registration_id, access_token_id |
| `token.revoked` | /oauth2/revoke called | access_token_id |
| `registration.revoked` | SET processed at events_endpoint | registration_id, iss, sub |

---

## Security Considerations

- **auth_time validation** — `auth_time` is required in ID-JAGs. Service validates against `idJagMaxAuthAgeSeconds`. If too old, returns `login_required` (401) — agent must get user to re-authenticate at provider.
- **claim_token handling** — returned exactly once in the registration response. Agent holds in memory only for ceremony duration. Do not persist past Step 4.
- **Token hashing** — `claim_token` is a bearer secret. Store only SHA-256 hash server-side.
- **Consent UX** — surface `resource_name` and `resource_logo_uri` from PRM to the user before asserting identity. This is the user's only consent gate.
- **Two revocation layers** — credential layer (agent-callable, `/oauth2/revoke`, kills one access_token) vs registration layer (provider-driven SETs at `events_endpoint`, tears down the whole delegation: identity_assertion + derived tokens + registration + claim handle — not tokens alone; see sample #21).
- **Replay protection** — cache `jti` values with TTL of at least `exp - iat` + clock skew (typically 6 min).
- **CIMD resolution** — if `client_id` is a URL, fetch as Client ID Metadata Document and verify `jwks_uri`.
- **Bulk revocation** — provide operator-facing mechanism to revoke all outstanding identity_assertions for a tenant.

## Agent Readiness Scanner Check

The [isitagentready.com](https://isitagentready.com) scanner validates auth.md as the `authMd` check. Pass criteria:

1. `/auth.md` served from site root with HTTP 200
2. Content is Markdown with H1 heading containing "auth.md"
3. Optionally validates OAuth Protected Resource Metadata at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
4. Optionally validates Authorization Server metadata at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`

**To pass the check minimally:**
```markdown
# auth.md

This service accepts AI agent registrations.

## Authentication

Agents can register via POST /agent/identity with a valid ID-JAG.
See below for supported methods.
```

**To pass with full marks (all metadata):**
- Serve `/auth.md` with proper heading
- Publish `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` with `resource`, `resource_name`, `resource_logo_uri`, `authorization_servers`, `scopes_supported`, `bearer_methods_supported: ["header"]`
- Publish `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` with `issuer`, `token_endpoint`, `revocation_endpoint`, `grant_types_supported`, and `agent_auth` block containing `skill`, `identity_endpoint`, `claim_endpoint`, `events_endpoint`, and registration methods

**Scan command:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST 'https://isitagentready.com/api/scan' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url":"https://YOUR-DOMAIN/","enabledChecks":["authMd"]}' | jq '.checks.discovery.authMd'
```
