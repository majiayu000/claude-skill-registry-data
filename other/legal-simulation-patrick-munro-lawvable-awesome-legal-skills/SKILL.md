**FINAL REMINDER**: This skill creates fictional scenarios for demonstration purposes only. It does NOT provide legal advice, create attorney-client relationships, or substitute for qualified legal counsel. All legal matters require consultation with licensed attorneys. Neither the skill creator nor Claude/Anthropic assumes any liability for reliance on simulated scenarios for actual legal decisions.

**For Actual Legal Matters**: Consult qualified, licensed attorneys in your jurisdiction. Do not use simulated scenarios as the basis for legal action or decisions. Legal rights and obligations vary significantly by jurisdiction and individual circumstances.
