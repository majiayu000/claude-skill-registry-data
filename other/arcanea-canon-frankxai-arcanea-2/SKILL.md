# Arcanea Canon Guardian Skill

## Purpose

This skill maintains absolute consistency across the Arcanea universe. It tracks every established fact, prevents contradictions, and ensures that all content—whether UI, marketing, fiction, or documentation—adheres to the sacred canon.

## Canon Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Immutable Core (Never Change)

These elements are foundational and cannot be contradicted:

```yaml
Platform Identity:
  Name: Arcanea
  Tagline: "Where anyone learns to create anything through magic"
  Nature: "The platform for magical creation"
  Philosophy: "Light over dark, collaboration over competition"

The Three Academies:
  - Atlantean Academy (Stories, blue/water)
  - Draconic Academy (Visuals, red/fire/sky)
  - Academy of Creation & Light (Music, white/gold/prismatic)

Core AI Types:
  Guardian: Personal AI companion (one per Creator)
  Luminor: Specialized AI assistant (shared, distinct personalities)

Currency System:
  ARC: Creative energy (earn by creating, spend on features)
  NEA: Governance tokens (earn by contributing, vote on platform)
```

### Tier 2: Established Canon (Change with Caution)

  Max: Level 50 (Legendary status)

Seasonal Structure:

  Radiance: June-August (Summer)
  Harvest: September-November (Autumn)
  Synthesis: December-February (Winter)
```

### Tier 3: Flexible Canon (Can Expand)

```yaml
Academy Locations:
  - Can add new spaces within academies
  - Cannot change core structure
  - Must match academy aesthetic

Realm Templates:
  - Can add new types
