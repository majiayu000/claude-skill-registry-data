# GDB Debugging Assistant

## Overview

This public intake copy packages `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/gdb-cli` from `https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills` into the native Omni Skills editorial shape without hiding its origin.

Use it when the operator needs the upstream workflow, support files, and repository context to stay intact while the public validator and private enhancer continue their normal downstream flow.

This intake keeps the copied upstream files intact and uses the `external_source` block in `metadata.json` plus `ORIGIN.md` as the provenance anchor for review.

# GDB Debugging Assistant

Imported source sections that did not map cleanly to the public headings are still preserved below or in the support files. Notable imported sections: Prerequisites, How It Works, Common Debugging Patterns, Security & Safety Notes, Links, Limitations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this section as the trigger filter. It should make the activation boundary explicit before the operator loads files, runs commands, or opens a pull request.

- Analyze core dumps or crash dumps
- Debug running processes with GDB attach
- Investigate crashes, deadlocks, or memory issues
- Get intelligent debugging assistance with source code context
- Debug multi-threaded applications
- The task is unrelated to C/C++ debugging

## Operating Table

| Situation | Start here | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First-time use | `metadata.json` | Confirms repository, branch, commit, and imported path through the `external_source` block before touching the copied workflow |
| Provenance review | `ORIGIN.md` | Gives reviewers a plain-language audit trail for the imported source |
| Workflow execution | `SKILL.md` | Starts with the smallest copied file that materially changes execution |
| Supporting context | `SKILL.md` | Adds the next most relevant copied source file without loading the entire package |
| Handoff decision | `## Related Skills` | Helps the operator switch to a stronger native skill when the task drifts |

## Workflow

This workflow is intentionally editorial and operational at the same time. It keeps the imported source useful to the operator while still satisfying the public intake standards that feed the downstream enhancer flow.

1. Confirm the user goal, the scope of the imported workflow, and whether this skill is still the right router for the task.
2. Read the overview and provenance files before loading any copied upstream support files.
3. Load only the references, examples, prompts, or scripts that materially change the outcome for the current request.
4. Execute the upstream workflow while keeping provenance and source boundaries explicit in the working notes.
5. Validate the result against the upstream expectations and the evidence you can point to in the copied files.
6. Escalate or hand off to a related skill when the work moves out of this imported workflow's center of gravity.
7. Before merge or closure, record what was used, what changed, and what the reviewer still needs to verify.

### Imported Workflow Notes

#### Imported: Overview

A GDB debugging skill designed for AI agents. Combines **source code analysis** with **runtime state inspection** using gdb-cli to provide intelligent debugging assistance for C/C++ programs.

#### Imported: Prerequisites

```bash
# Install gdb-cli
pip install gdb-cli

# Or from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/Cerdore/gdb-cli.git

# Verify GDB has Python support
gdb -nx -q -batch -ex "python print('OK')"
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.6.8+
- GDB 9.0+ with Python support enabled
- Linux OS

## Examples

### Example 1: Ask for the upstream workflow directly

```text
Use @gdb-cli to handle <task>. Start from the copied upstream workflow, load only the files that change the outcome, and keep provenance visible in the answer.
```

**Explanation:** This is the safest starting point when the operator needs the imported workflow, but not the entire repository.

### Example 2: Ask for a provenance-grounded review

```text
Review @gdb-cli against metadata.json and ORIGIN.md, then explain which copied upstream files you would load first and why.
```

**Explanation:** Use this before review or troubleshooting when you need a precise, auditable explanation of origin and file selection.

### Example 3: Narrow the copied support files before execution

```text
Use @gdb-cli for <task>. Load only the copied references, examples, or scripts that change the outcome, and name the files explicitly before proceeding.
```

**Explanation:** This keeps the skill aligned with progressive disclosure instead of loading the whole copied package by default.

### Example 4: Build a reviewer packet

```text
Review @gdb-cli using the copied upstream files plus provenance, then summarize any gaps before merge.
```

**Explanation:** This is useful when the PR is waiting for human review and you want a repeatable audit packet.

### Imported Usage Notes

#### Imported: Examples

### Example 1: Core Dump Analysis

```bash
# Load core dump
gdb-cli load --binary ./myapp --core /tmp/core.1234

# Get crash location
gdb-cli bt -s a1b2c3 --full

# Examine crash frame
gdb-cli locals-cmd -s a1b2c3 --frame 0
```

### Example 2: Live Process Debugging

```bash
# Attach to stuck server
gdb-cli attach --pid 12345

# Check all threads
gdb-cli threads -s b2c3d4

# Get all backtraces
gdb-cli thread-apply -s b2c3d4 bt --all
```

## Best Practices

Treat the generated public skill as a reviewable packaging layer around the upstream repository. The goal is to keep provenance explicit and load only the copied source material that materially improves execution.

- Always read source code before drawing conclusions from variable values
- Use --range for pagination on large thread counts or deep backtraces
- Use ptype to understand complex data structures before examining values
- Check all threads for multi-threaded issues
- Cross-reference types with source code definitions
- Keep the imported skill grounded in the upstream repository; do not invent steps that the source material cannot support.
- Prefer the smallest useful set of support files so the workflow stays auditable and fast to review.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: The operator skipped the imported context and answered too generically

**Symptoms:** The result ignores the upstream workflow in `plugins/antigravity-awesome-skills-claude/skills/gdb-cli`, fails to mention provenance, or does not use any copied source files at all.
**Solution:** Re-open `metadata.json`, `ORIGIN.md`, and the most relevant copied upstream files. Check the `external_source` block first, then restate the provenance before continuing.

### Problem: The imported workflow feels incomplete during review

**Symptoms:** Reviewers can see the generated `SKILL.md`, but they cannot quickly tell which references, examples, or scripts matter for the current task.
**Solution:** Point at the exact copied references, examples, scripts, or assets that justify the path you took. If the gap is still real, record it in the PR instead of hiding it.

### Problem: The task drifted into a different specialization

**Symptoms:** The imported skill starts in the right place, but the work turns into debugging, architecture, design, security, or release orchestration that a native skill handles better.
**Solution:** Use the related skills section to hand off deliberately. Keep the imported provenance visible so the next skill inherits the right context instead of starting blind.

## Additional Resources

Use this support matrix and the linked files below as the operator packet for this imported skill. They should reflect real copied source material, not generic scaffolding.

| Resource family | What it gives the reviewer | Example path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references` | copied reference notes, guides, or background material from upstream | `references/n/a` |
| `examples` | worked examples or reusable prompts copied from upstream | `examples/n/a` |
| `scripts` | upstream helper scripts that change execution or validation | `scripts/n/a` |
| `agents` | routing or delegation notes that are genuinely part of the imported package | `agents/n/a` |
| `assets` | supporting assets or schemas copied from the source package | `assets/n/a` |



### Imported Reference Notes

#### Imported: How It Works

### Step 1: Initialize Debug Session

**For core dump analysis:**
```bash
gdb-cli load --binary <binary_path> --core <core_path> [--gdb-path <gdb_path>]
```

**For live process debugging:**
```bash
gdb-cli attach --pid <pid> [--binary <binary_path>]
```

**Output:** A session_id like `"session_id": "a1b2c3"`. Store this for subsequent commands.

### Step 2: Gather Initial Information

```bash
SESSION="<session_id>"

# List all threads
gdb-cli threads -s $SESSION

# Get backtrace (with local variables)
gdb-cli bt -s $SESSION --full

# Get registers
gdb-cli registers -s $SESSION
```

### Step 3: Correlate Source Code (CRITICAL)

For each frame in the backtrace:
1. **Extract frame info**: `{file}:{line} in {function}`
2. **Read source context**: Get ±20 lines around the crash point
3. **Get local variables**: `gdb-cli locals-cmd -s $SESSION --frame <N>`
4. **Analyze**: Correlate code logic with variable values

**Example correlation:**
```
Frame #0: process_data() at src/worker.c:87
Source code shows:
  85: Node* node = get_node(id);
  86: if (node == NULL) return;
  87: node->data = value;  <- Crash here

Variables show:
  node = 0x0 (NULL)

Analysis: The NULL check on line 86 didn't catch the issue.
```

### Step 4: Deep Investigation

```bash
# Examine variables
gdb-cli eval-cmd -s $SESSION "variable_name"
gdb-cli eval-cmd -s $SESSION "ptr->field"
gdb-cli ptype -s $SESSION "struct_name"

# Memory inspection
gdb-cli memory -s $SESSION "0x7fffffffe000" --size 64

# Disassembly
gdb-cli disasm -s $SESSION --count 20

# Check all threads (for deadlock analysis)
gdb-cli thread-apply -s $SESSION bt --all

# View shared libraries
gdb-cli sharedlibs -s $SESSION
```

### Step 5: Session Management

```bash
# List active sessions
gdb-cli sessions

# Check session status
gdb-cli status -s $SESSION

# Stop session (cleanup)
gdb-cli stop -s $SESSION
```

#### Imported: Common Debugging Patterns

### Pattern: Null Pointer Dereference

**Indicators:**
- Crash on memory access instruction
- Pointer variable is 0x0

**Investigation:**
```bash
gdb-cli registers -s $SESSION  # Check RIP
gdb-cli eval-cmd -s $SESSION "ptr"  # Check pointer value
```

### Pattern: Deadlock

**Indicators:**
- Multiple threads stuck in lock functions
- `pthread_mutex_lock` in backtrace

**Investigation:**
```bash
gdb-cli thread-apply -s $SESSION bt --all
# Look for circular wait patterns
```

### Pattern: Memory Corruption

**Indicators:**
- Crash in malloc/free
- Garbage values in variables

**Investigation:**
```bash
gdb-cli memory -s $SESSION "&variable" --size 128
gdb-cli registers -s $SESSION
```
