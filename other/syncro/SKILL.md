# Syncro  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `syncro-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/syncro/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/syncro/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `syncro-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `syncro-cli` and `syncro-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

syncro-cli mirrors your Syncro tenant into a local SQLite store so tickets, customers, assets, invoices, and RMM alerts become joinable, searchable, and fast. On top of full API coverage it adds reports Syncro never rendered: uninvoiced time, invoice drift, AR aging, customer profitability, SLA aging triage, and fleet-wide patch gaps. Built for agents with --json, --select, --dry-run, typed exit codes, and adaptive backoff for Syncro's 180-requests-per-minute limit. The cross-entity reports read the local store, so run `sync` first; some (uninvoiced, drift, margin, patch-gaps, aging) also need sub-resources like timer entries, patches, and comments to be synced.

## When to Use This CLI

Choose syncro-cli when an agent or technician needs to query, report on, or update a Syncro tenant from the command line. It is the right tool for cross-entity questions (uninvoiced time, AR aging, patch gaps, alert noise) that Syncro's UI and single-call API cannot answer, and for scripted bulk operations that would otherwise hit the rate limit.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Money you are leaving on the table
- **`billing uninvoiced`**  -  Find logged-but-unbilled labor across every customer so no billable time slips.

  _Reach for this to recover revenue: it surfaces money the MSP already earned but never billed._

  ```bash
  syncro-cli billing uninvoiced --agent
  ```
- **`billing drift`**  -  Surface tickets closed long ago that have logged time but were never invoiced.

  _Use after a billing run to catch revenue that silently slips once a ticket closes._

  ```bash
  syncro-cli billing drift --closed-before 14d --agent
  ```
- **`billing ar-aging`**  -  Bucket unpaid invoices into 0-30/30-60/60-90/90+ day aging tiers.

  _The canonical owner finance question  -  pick this to see what cash is aging out._

  ```bash
  syncro-cli billing ar-aging --agent
  ```

### Owner analytics
- **`customers margin`**  -  Compare logged labor against invoiced revenue per customer over a window.

  _Use to find which customers actually make money before renewal conversations._

  ```bash
  syncro-cli customers margin --window 90d --agent
  ```
- **`customers profile`**  -  One-shot cross-entity customer snapshot: open tickets, assets, AR balance, contracts, and latest RMM alerts in a single card.

  _Reach for this when you need full customer context (health, money, risk) before drafting a reply, renewal, or escalation._

  ```bash
  syncro-cli customers profile 12345 --agent
  ```

### Triage that compounds
- **`tickets aging`**  -  List open tickets past SLA with no comment in the last N hours.

  _The daily triage ritual  -  pick this first thing to find tickets going stale._

  ```bash
  syncro-cli tickets aging --no-comment 48h --agent
  ```
- **`snapshot diff`**  -  Diff two retained local sync snapshots across all entities.

  _Use to answer what changed across assets and tickets between two syncs._

  ```bash
  syncro-cli snapshot diff --since 7d --agent
  ```

### Fleet visibility
- **`assets patch-gaps`**  -  Rank assets missing critical patches across every customer.

  _Reach for this for fleet-wide patch posture without N throttled API calls._

  ```bash
  syncro-cli assets patch-gaps --severity critical --agent
  ```
- **`alerts noise`**  -  Rank customers by RMM alert volume over a time window.

  _Use to find the noisy customer draining tech time before it burns out the team._

  ```bash
  syncro-cli alerts noise --window 30d --agent
  ```
- **`alerts orphans`**  -  Surface RMM alerts that never became a ticket within a window.

  _Pick this to catch silent failures and pure noise that slipped past dispatch._

  ```bash
  syncro-cli alerts orphans --window 7d --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
syncro-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Recover unbilled labor

```bash
syncro-cli billing uninvoiced --agent
```

Lists logged time with no linked invoice grouped by customer (fields: customer_name, uninvoiced_hours, uninvoiced_entries).

### Morning ticket triage

```bash
syncro-cli tickets aging --no-comment 24h --json
```

Open tickets with no comment in 24h, ready to assign or escalate.

### Fleet patch posture

```bash
syncro-cli assets patch-gaps --severity critical --agent --select customer_name,asset_name,missing_patches
```

Cross-customer view of assets with missing/pending patches (fields: customer_name, asset_name, missing_patches).

### Find the noisy customer

```bash
syncro-cli alerts noise --window 30d --json
```

Ranks customers by RMM alert volume over the last month to spot draining accounts.

### Safe customer update

```bash
syncro-cli customers update 123 --business-name "Acme LLC" --dry-run
```

Previews a sparse update that sends only the changed field; use --dry-run to confirm the body before committing.

## Auth Setup

Set SYNCRO_SUBDOMAIN to your account subdomain and SYNCRO_API_KEY to a token created under Admin > API > API Tokens (Custom Permissions). The CLI sends it as an Authorization: Bearer header; if a tenant rejects that, Syncro also accepts the token as an api_key query parameter.

Run `syncro-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  syncro-cli appointment-types list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
syncro-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
syncro-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
syncro-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/syncro-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `SYNCRO_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `SYNCRO_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
syncro-cli profile save briefing --json
syncro-cli --profile briefing appointment-types list
syncro-cli profile list --json
syncro-cli profile show briefing
syncro-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `syncro-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add syncro-mcp -- syncro-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which syncro-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   syncro-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `syncro-cli <command> --help`.
