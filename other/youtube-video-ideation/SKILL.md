# YouTube Video Ideation (Ed Lawrence Method + Tournament Selection)

Generate video concepts (title + thumbnail + angle) that pass Ed Lawrence's critical filters, then use tournament selection to identify the strongest idea.

## Core Workflow

The ideation process follows these steps:

1. **Goal Setting** - Define video objective (email/sales/views)
2. **Positioning Check** - Verify alignment with channel positioning
3. **Concept Generation** - Create 10 video concepts using Ed's patterns
4. **Tournament Selection** - Narrow through systematic comparison (10 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1)
5. **Final Validation** - Verify passes Ed's 3 critical questions

---

## Step 1: Goal Setting

Before generating ideas, clarify the video's purpose:

**Three Goals:**
1. **Email Signups** - Optimize for clicks to lead magnet
2. **Sales** - Target dream buyer's specific problem
3. **Views** - Jump on trends, broader appeal

Ask: "What is this video supposed to achieve?"

Document the goal before proceeding.

## Step 2: Positioning Check

**AEO Channel Positioning:**

**Avatar:** Business owners and marketers who've invested in SEO/digital marketing but are invisible to ChatGPT/Gemini. They're solution-aware (know AI search matters) but don't know how to fix it.

**Backstory:**
- Scaled hair clinic $0 -> $5M with Meta ads (3 years)
- Scaled same clinic $5M -> $10M with AI chatbots
- ChatGPT convinced ME to buy a Porsche instead of BMW
- Now pioneering AEO optimization

**Enemy:** Traditional SEO agencies that ignore AI search. Brands that think "if it's not on Google, it doesn't exist."

**Belief:** "SEO is dying. The brands that win in 2026+ will be the ones ChatGPT recommends."

**Space:** THE AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) expert showing real results from ChatGPT/Gemini visibility.

---

## Step 3: The Three Critical Questions (Filter)

Every video idea MUST pass these before tournament:

### Question 1: Do my viewers even know what this means?
- Avoid jargon or concepts your avatar doesn't recognize
- If they don't understand the words, they won't click
- "AEO" needs context - pair with "ChatGPT" or "AI search"

### Question 2: Do they understand why it matters?
- The value must be immediately obvious
- Don't make them guess why they should care
- Connect to business outcomes (revenue, leads, visibility)

### Question 3: Do they think it solves the problem they actually have?
- Match their perceived problem, not the "real" problem
- Speak to what keeps them up at night
- "Invisible to AI" resonates more than "lack structured data"

**Pre-filter rule:** If an idea fails any question, discard it before tournament.

---

## Step 4: Concept Generation

Generate 10 video concepts using these patterns:

### Pattern Distribution:
- **3 Pain Point concepts** - Lead with viewer's problem
- **3 Proof concepts** - Lead with your results/credibility
- **2 Comparison concepts** - Test/compare approaches
- **2 Contrarian concepts** - Challenge conventional wisdom

### For Each Concept, Define:

**TITLE:** The exact video title
**THUMBNAIL:** Visual description (face + text + metaphor)
**ANGLE:** What makes THIS video different from others
**HOOK:** The first 10 seconds (pattern interrupt)

### Title Formulas:

**CRITICAL POSITIONING RULE:**
**ALWAYS include positioning keywords: AEO, ChatGPT, Gemini, AI search, LLM**

Examples:
- Include "ChatGPT" or "Gemini" in every title
- Use "AEO" when audience is aware of term
- Add business context ("Your Brand", "Your Business")

---

**Pain Point Formula:**
- "Why [Your Avatar] [Fails/Struggles/Can't Succeed] in ChatGPT"
  - Example: "Why Your Brand is Invisible to ChatGPT (And How to Fix It)"
- "Your [Thing] is [Costing/Losing] You Customers to AI"
  - Example: "Your SEO is Losing You Customers to ChatGPT"
- "[Problem] is [Adjective] until you [Action]"
  - Example: "AI Search is Impossible Until You Do This One Thing"

**Proof Formula:**
- "I [Did X] for [Time Period] (Here's What Happened)"
  - Example: "I Tracked ChatGPT Mentions for 30 Days (Here's What I Found)"
- "This [Thing] [Result] (Full Breakdown)"
  - Example: "This Brand Went From 0 to #1 in ChatGPT (Full Breakdown)"
- "[Number] [People/Things] and Here's What I Learned"
  - Example: "I Audited 100 Brands for AEO (Here's What Winners Do)"

**Comparison Formula:**
- "[Option A] vs [Option B]: [Time] Test"
  - Example: "SEO vs AEO: Which Actually Matters in 2026?"
- "I [Tried Both] (The Results Shocked Me)"
  - Example: "I Optimized for Google AND ChatGPT (The Results Shocked Me)"

**Contrarian Formula:**
- "Everyone Says [X]. I Did [Y]"
  - Example: "Everyone Says SEO is King. I Stopped Caring About Google."
- "Why [Common Belief] Is Wrong"
  - Example: "Why SEO is Dead (And What's Replacing It)"
- "I'm Doing What [Group] Won't"
  - Example: "I'm Telling My Clients to Forget Google Rankings"

### Thumbnail Requirements:
- Your face + emotion (surprised, serious, excited)
- 3 words max of text, LARGE and readable on mobile
- Visual metaphor showing the concept
- High contrast (bright backgrounds, bold text)

### Angle Requirements:
- From someone who's actually done it (credentials)
- The opposite of what everyone says (contrarian)
- With real numbers (specificity)
- From unique perspective (positioning)
