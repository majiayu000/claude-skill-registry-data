  Cross-cutting reference manager for medical manuscripts. Single entry point

  cross-reference QC, marker conversion (``[N]`` ↔ ``[@key]``), and native
  Zotero CWYW field-code injection. Replaces the inline reference-handling

  ``/revise``, ``/peer-review``, ``/sync-submission``, and any skill that
  produces a journal submission. Audit-only verification stays in
  ``/verify-refs`` — this skill writes (renders, injects, converts); that
  skill only reads.

You are routing reference-handling work for a medical manuscript. The user is
somewhere in the lifecycle — drafting, building a circulation DOCX, swapping
CSL after a journal rejection, fixing a cross-reference defect surfaced by
QC, or wiring up live Zotero field codes for a co-author Word workflow. Pick
the right tool from the decision table; do not invent a parallel pipeline.

## Why This Skill Exists

Reference handling spans every late-stage skill: `/write-paper` builds the
first DOCX, `/revise` rebuilds it after each reviewer round, `/peer-review`
emits a critique that quotes references back, `/sync-submission` packages the
final tarball, `/find-journal` informs CSL swaps on rejection cascade, and
`/verify-refs` audits the bibliography. Until 2026-05-01 these scripts lived
under `skills/write-paper/scripts/`, which made `/revise` and `/sync-submission`
silently depend on a sibling skill — a layering inversion that broke when
`/write-paper` was loaded into a non-research project. Moving the
lifecycle tools here turns reference handling into a first-class concern
with one decision tree, one set of CSL files, and one provenance file
(`NOTICE.md`) for the vendored Zotero CWYW writer.

Validated 2026-05-01 against a 21-reference meta-analysis manuscript
(a meta-analysis project's submission) for both pandoc-citeproc and Zotero-CWYW paths.

## Anti-Hallucination Guarantees

1. **Citekey discipline (Phase 0)**: every in-text citation must be
   `[@bibkey]` resolvable in `refs.bib`. `scripts/check_citation_keys.py` is
   a hard gate — UNDEFINED keys exit non-zero and block the build.

   **`[@NEW:topic]` placeholder convention**: while drafting, `/write-paper`
   may emit `[@NEW:topic_slug]` markers for citations the author still needs
   to source. `check_citation_keys.py` classifies these as `NEW_PLACEHOLDER`
   (not UNDEFINED) and exits 0 — the build is allowed to proceed during
   drafting. Phase 7.6 (DOCX render) is a hard gate: zero NEW_PLACEHOLDER
   entries must remain. Resolve each by adding the citation to Zotero (then
   `/lit-sync` refreshes refs.bib) and replacing the placeholder with the
   real `[@bibkey]`. Never let a `[@NEW:...]` reach a rendered DOCX.
2. **No hand-typed References list** — references are always rendered by
   pandoc citeproc + journal CSL or by the Zotero Word plugin (CWYW). See
   `~/.claude/rules/manuscript-references.md`.
3. **Zotero metadata is never invented** — `inject_zotero_cwyw.py` fetches
   item data live from `http://localhost:23119`. Any HTTP failure aborts
   with a non-zero exit so partial bibliographies never reach the user.
4. **Marker conversion is mapping-driven** — `md_marker_convert.py` will
   never guess a Zotero key for a number; unmapped markers stay as `[N]`
   and are reported on stderr.
5. **Cross-reference QC is a submission gate** — `scripts/check_xref.py`
   `--strict` exits 1 on any `MISSING_DOCX` / `MISSING_BODY` / `MISMATCH`,
   blocking pipelines that try to ship a DOCX whose Table/Figure citations
   don't match captions.
6. **Audit boundary**: this skill writes; bibliographic correctness against
   PubMed/CrossRef stays in `/verify-refs`. Always invoke `/verify-refs`
   after a render before signing off — one read-only audit, one writer.

## Decision Tree

| Situation | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Validate `[@bibkey]` ↔ `refs.bib` (UNDEFINED / UNUSED keys) | `scripts/check_citation_keys.py` | Hard build gate, runs in seconds |
| Single-author submission lockdown, frozen output | `scripts/render_pandoc.sh -j <journal>` | Reproducible, CI-friendly |
| Cascade rejection (e.g., ER → JVIR → CVIR) | `render_pandoc.sh` with new `-j` | CSL swap reformats references in seconds |
| Verify a journal CSL renders the in-text format / DOI / journal-name style the author guide actually requires | `scripts/check_csl_render.py --csl <x>.csl --bib refs.bib --journal <key>` | A stub/"dependent" CSL inherits its parent's format, which may differ from the guide (parenthetical vs superscript, DOI kept, full journal names). Run BEFORE submission, not after the proof PDF |
| Reference list prints FULL journal names but the journal wants NLM abbreviations | `scripts/fill_journal_abbrev.py` | Resolves each entry DOI → PMID → PubMed NLM `shortjournal` into the `.bib` so CSL `form="short"` renders abbreviations; authoritative source, never invents abbreviations |
| Reviewer revision: add 1–2 refs to a Word doc with co-authors live | Zotero Word plugin (user GUI) | Minimal disruption to track-changes flow |
| Reviewer revision: bulk reference change | Edit markdown SSOT, re-run `render_pandoc.sh` | Consistency, no cherry-pick risk |
| Migrate `[N]` numeric markers → `[@key]` for pandoc | `scripts/md_marker_convert.py --to-keys` | Mapping-driven, partial conversion safe |
| Convert `[@key]` → `[N]` for round-trip / debug | `scripts/md_marker_convert.py --to-numbers` | Same map, opposite direction |
| Wire native Zotero CWYW field codes into a .docx (live Refresh in Word) | `scripts/inject_zotero_cwyw.py` | Co-author Word workflow, post-circulation editability |
| Manuscript ↔ rendered DOCX cross-reference QC | `scripts/check_xref.py --strict` | Submission gate (P0 blocker on mismatch) |
| Figures/tables submitted as separate attachments (radiology, most medical journals) | `check_xref.py --strict --allow-separate-attachments` | Downgrades `MISSING_DOCX` to WARN; `MISSING_BODY`/`MISMATCH` remain P0 |
| **v_(N+1) docx build-time regeneration check** | `check_xref.py --vN-docx-md5 <prev>.docx [--vN-md <prev>.md]` | Defense-in-depth: identity = unmodified seed copy; missing diff lines = body not regenerated |
| **Duplicate bibliography in the built artifact** | `scripts/check_reference_duplication.py --docx <built>.docx` (or `--text <rendered>.md`) | Fires when the reference list is duplicated — `DUP_REF_HEADING` / `REF_NUMBER_RESTART` / `REF_SIGNATURE_DUP` (Major). Catches the hybrid hand-typed `## References` list + pandoc `--citeproc` auto-bibliography, which renders **two** lists (the second often after the legends). Run after any citeproc build |
| **Publisher markup in a `.bib` title** (renders as garbage) | `scripts/check_bib_title_markup.py --bib refs.bib --strict` | CrossRef ships `<scp>WHO</scp>` / `<i>IDH</i>` in titles and a DOI-add stores them verbatim; BBT then escapes them (`{$<$}scp{$>$}`) or strips them without restoring the space (`andTERTPromoter`, `1p/19q,IDH`). `verify_refs` proves the reference is *true*; this proves it will *print*. `TITLE_MARKUP` / `TITLE_FUSION` (Major) |
| **Master pre-submission gate** (recommended before any submission) | `scripts/pre_submission_gate.sh` | Chains `check_citation_keys` → `check_bib_title_markup` → `verify_refs --strict` → `render_pandoc` (optional) → `check_xref --strict`; single artifact `qc/pre_submission_gate.json` |
| Direct render with a built-in reference audit | `scripts/render_pandoc.sh` (audits the `.bib` via `/verify-refs` first; blocks on FABRICATED/MISMATCH/duplicates) | Defense-in-depth so even a direct render call cannot ship hallucinated citations; best-effort (skips with a warning if `/verify-refs` is not alongside), opt out with `-S`. The master gate passes `-S` since it audits in stage 2 |
| Bibliographic audit against PubMed / CrossRef | **delegate** to `/verify-refs` | Audit-only — keep writer/auditor separation |

## Workflows

### A. Pandoc citeproc (default for solo authors and final submissions)

User provides `manuscript.md` with `[@bibkey]` citations + `refs.bib`.
1. **Gate**: `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_citation_keys.py" manuscript.md refs.bib`
   — exits non-zero on UNDEFINED keys. Fix and re-run.
2. **Render**:
   ```bash
   "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/render_pandoc.sh" \
     -j european-radiology \
     -i manuscript.md \
     -b refs.bib \
     -o manuscript_final.docx
   ```
   Bundled CSLs (in `citation_styles/`): `european-radiology`, `radiology`,
   `american-journal-of-roentgenology`, `cardiovascular-and-interventional-radiology`,
   `korean-journal-of-radiology`, `vancouver`, `vancouver-superscript`,
   `springer-basic-brackets`, `springer-vancouver-brackets`. Use
   `radiology` for RYAI; use `vancouver` for JVIR (no dedicated CSL).
3. **QC**:
   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_xref.py" \
     --md manuscript.md --docx manuscript_final.docx \
     --out qc/xref_audit.json --strict
   ```
   Treat `submission_safe: false` as a halt. Route fixes by symptom — see
   the table in `references/check_xref_symptoms.md`.
4. **Audit hand-off**: invoke `/verify-refs` for the PubMed/CrossRef audit
   before sign-off.

### B. Zotero CWYW (co-author Word workflow)

User has a markdown SSOT and wants reviewers to edit citations directly in
Word. Each reference must already exist as a Zotero item; the user supplies
a `[N] → ZoteroKey` mapping.
1. **Convert markers**:
   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/md_marker_convert.py" \
     --input manuscript.md --output manuscript_keys.md \
     --map ref_map.json --to-keys
   ```
   Optionally stage with `--active-ns 1,2,3,4,19` for a sample build first
   (validated on an active meta-analysis project: 5-ref sample reduces Word Refresh blast radius
   when debugging).
2. **Render to .docx** with pandoc (workflow A) so the body has plain text
   `[@key]` markers, OR pre-build a .docx some other way that still contains
   plain `[@key]` text.
3. **Inject CWYW**:
   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/inject_zotero_cwyw.py" \
     --input manuscript_keys.docx --output manuscript_cwyw.docx \
     --user-id 16613550 --keys-from keys.txt
   ```
   The script fetches Zotero metadata via the local connector (port 23119);
   any HTTP failure aborts with non-zero exit.
4. **First-build instruction** (REQUIRED — see Known Limitation #1): open
   the output in Word → Zotero tab → **Add/Edit Bibliography** once. After
   that, **Refresh** keeps citations and bibliography in sync as authors
   edit.
5. **Surgical patches are unsafe**: for ref additions in later rounds, edit
   the markdown SSOT and rebuild the whole .docx instead of regex-patching
   the post-CWYW file. Zotero's rendered `[N]` superscripts can collide
   with plain `[N]` markers and corrupt the field codes.

### C. Cascade rejection re-render (find-journal hand-off)

User got rejected from journal A and `/find-journal` recommended journal B.
1. Confirm the new CSL exists in `citation_styles/` (or fetch from
   https://citationstyles.org/styles and drop in).
2. Re-run `render_pandoc.sh -j <new-csl>` against the same `manuscript.md` +
   `refs.bib`.
3. Re-run `check_xref.py --strict`.
4. Re-run `/verify-refs` if any new references were added during the
   inter-journal revision.

### D. Cross-reference QC only

User shipped a manuscript and a reviewer flagged a Table/Figure mismatch.
1. Run `check_xref.py --strict` on the current `manuscript.md` + `.docx`.
2. Inspect `qc/xref_audit.json`. Body caption is the SSOT — fix `manuscript.md`
   and rebuild, never patch the .docx by hand.
3. See `references/check_xref_symptoms.md` for the
   `MISSING_BODY` / `MISSING_DOCX` / `MISMATCH` triage table.
4. For journals that accept figures and tables as **separate attachment files**
   (the default in European Radiology, Radiology, AJR, JVIR, KJR, and most
   medical journals), pass `--allow-separate-attachments`. `MISSING_DOCX` rows
   are then recorded as WARN rather than FAIL; `MISSING_BODY` and `MISMATCH`
   remain P0 because they indicate SSOT drift, not attachment policy.

### D'. v_(N+1) docx regeneration check (build-time companion)

When building v_(N+1) from a frozen v_N, the v_(N+1) docx MUST differ
from v_N docx by content — a byte-identical copy is a silent seed-copy
that will revert markdown edits at peer review. `check_xref.py` carries
two flags for the build-time companion to the submission-time gate
in `scripts/verify_package_integrity.py --assert-vN-docx-changed`:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check_xref.py" \
    --md manuscript_v2.md \
    --docx manuscript_v2.docx \
    --vN-docx-md5 manuscript_v1.docx \
    --vN-md manuscript_v1.md \
    --strict
```

- `--vN-docx-md5` alone: MD5 identity check. Identical bytes = FAIL.
- `--vN-docx-md5 + --vN-md`: additionally extracts the markdown-only diff
  between v_N and v_(N+1) and verifies each ≥40-char diff line appears
  verbatim (whitespace-normalized, case-insensitive) in the new docx
  body XML. Missing diff lines = body did not pick up the markdown edits.

Output records the result under `vN_docx_check` in `qc/xref_audit.json`.
Either failure mode causes a non-zero exit even without `--strict`.

### E. Master pre-submission gate (recommended end-to-end chain)

The single entry point that combines workflows A and D plus `/verify-refs`
into one aborting chain. Use this immediately before submission or before
circulating a v_N package to senior co-authors.

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/pre_submission_gate.sh" \
    --md manuscript/manuscript.md \
    --bib manuscript/_src/refs.bib \
    --docx submission/<journal>/manuscript.docx \
    --allow-separate-attachments    # omit if the journal accepts inline figures/tables
```

Stage order (first failure aborts):
1. `check_citation_keys.py manuscript.md refs.bib` — UNDEFINED / UNUSED keys
2. `verify_refs.py refs.bib --strict` — PubMed / CrossRef per-entry verification
3. `render_pandoc.sh -j <csl> -i ... -b ... -o ...` — invoked only when `--docx` is omitted
4. `check_xref.py --md ... --docx ... --strict [--allow-separate-attachments]`

On success the chain writes `qc/pre_submission_gate.json` (plus the
per-stage artifacts `qc/reference_audit.json` and `qc/xref_audit.json`)
with `submission_safe: true`. On any failure the JSON records the failing
stage and exit code, and the script exits non-zero — do not submit until
the failing stage passes.

Critical: the gate does **not** reimplement any check. It calls the existing
scripts as subprocesses. If you find yourself wanting to add a check, add it
to the underlying script (the gate then picks it up automatically).

### F. BibTeX author-format corruption (rendered-name check)

Entries written as `author = {Surname AB and Surname2 CD}` (family + initials, **no comma**) make BibTeX treat the last token as the family name, rendering "AB S, CD S2". Always store `author = {Family, Full Given}`. Concatenated initials even with a comma (`Family, AB`) still collapse to a single initial under CSL `initialize-with`, so use the full forename from PubMed `efetch`.

`/verify-refs` compares bib content against PubMed but does not see the rendered output; grep the rendered docx and the bib separately:

```bash
unzip -p out.docx word/document.xml | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | grep -oE "[A-Z]{2} [A-Z], [A-Z]{2} [A-Z]"   # corruption signature in output
grep -nE 'author\s*=\s*\{[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z]{1,3}( |\})' refs.bib                                          # no-comma source entries
```

## Quality Gates

This skill defines **three submission gates** and **one user approval gate**:

- **Gate 1 (citekey integrity)**: `check_citation_keys.py` exits non-zero on
  UNDEFINED keys. The pipeline halts; the user reviews and fixes.
- **Gate 2 (cross-reference integrity)**: `check_xref.py --strict` exits 1 on
  any `MISSING_DOCX` / `MISSING_BODY` / `MISMATCH` row. The user reviews
  `qc/xref_audit.json` and resolves before proceeding.
- **Gate 3 (audit hand-off)**: before sign-off, the user must run
  `/verify-refs` and confirm `submission_safe: true` in
  `qc/reference_audit.json`. This skill never marks the bibliography
  audited on its own.
- **User approval gate (CWYW first build)**: the user must perform Word →
  Zotero → Add/Edit Bibliography manually after the first
  `inject_zotero_cwyw.py` build. The skill cannot automate this and warns
  on stderr that it is required.

## Known Limitations

1. **First-build empty BIBL field (CWYW)**: `inject_zotero_cwyw.py` writes a
   stub `ADDIN ZOTERO_BIBL` field; Word's Zotero Refresh treats an empty
   stub as user-customized and refuses to populate it. User must run
   Add/Edit Bibliography once. Subsequent Refresh works as expected.
   Validated on Word for Mac, an active meta-analysis project.
2. **Webpage / non-journal item types**: handled by the patched
   `zotero_to_csl_json` that fetches Zotero's native CSL-JSON; do not bypass
   this patch.
3. **Surgical post-build regex patches are unsafe** — see Workflow B step 5.
4. **Local Zotero required for CWYW** — port 23119 must be reachable; no
   web-API fallback yet (would need `ZOTERO_API_KEY`). On failure the script
   aborts with non-zero exit so partial builds never ship.
