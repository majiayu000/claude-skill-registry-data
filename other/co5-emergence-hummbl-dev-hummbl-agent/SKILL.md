# CO5 Emergence

Apply the CO5 Emergence transformation to recognize higher-order behavior arising from component interactions.

## What is CO5?

**CO5 (Emergence)** Recognize higher-order behavior arising from component interactions.

## When to Use CO5

### Ideal Situations
- Assemble components into a coherent whole
- Integrate multiple solutions into a unified approach
- Design systems that depend on clear interfaces and seams

### Trigger Questions
- "How can we use Emergence here?"
- "What changes if we apply CO5 to this integrating two services?"
- "Which assumptions does CO5 help us surface?"

## The CO5 Process

### Step 1: Define the focus
```typescript
// Using CO5 (Emergence) - Establish the focus
const focus = "Recognize higher-order behavior arising from component interactions";
```

### Step 2: Apply the model
```typescript
// Using CO5 (Emergence) - Apply the transformation
const output = applyModel("CO5", focus);
```

### Step 3: Synthesize outcomes
```typescript
// Using CO5 (Emergence) - Capture insights and decisions
const insights = summarize(output);
```

## Practical Example

```typescript
// Using CO5 (Emergence) - Example in a integrating two services
const result = applyModel("CO5", "Recognize higher-order behavior arising from component interactions" );
```

## Integration with Other Transformations

- **CO5 -> DE3**: Pair with DE3 when sequencing matters.
- **CO5 -> SY8**: Use SY8 to validate or stress-test.
- **CO5 -> RE2**: Apply RE2 to compose the output.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify the context that requires CO5
- [ ] Apply the model using explicit CO5 references
- [ ] Document assumptions and outputs
- [ ] Confirm alignment with stakeholders or owners

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating the model as a checklist instead of a lens
- Skipping documentation of assumptions or rationale
- Over-applying the model without validating impact

## Best Practices

- Use explicit CO5 references in comments and docs
- Keep the output focused and actionable
- Combine with adjacent transformations when needed

## Measurement and Success

- Clearer decisions and fewer unresolved assumptions
- Faster alignment across stakeholders
- Reusable artifacts for future iterations

## Installation and Usage

### Nix Installation
```nix
{
  programs.moltbot.plugins = [
    { source = "github:hummbl-dev/hummbl-agent?dir=skills/CO-composition/co5-emergence"; }
  ];
}
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
moltbot-registry install hummbl-agent/co5-emergence
```

### Usage with Commands
```bash
/apply-transformation CO5 "Recognize higher-order behavior arising from component interactions"
```
