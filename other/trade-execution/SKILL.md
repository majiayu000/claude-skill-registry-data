## Defaults

| Parameter | Default Value | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| swing_reward_min | 2x risk | Swing trades require minimum 2:1 reward-to-risk |
| scalp_reward | 1x risk | Scalp trades take profits at 1:1 reward-to-risk |
| default_position_risk | 1-2% of capital | Standard risk per trade |
| mtr_failure_priority | highest | MTR failure is the strongest continuation signal |

## Preflight

Run canonical pre-flight per `contracts/preflight.md`. Include the `X-Agentii-Trace` header on every tool call per `contracts/x-agentii-trace-header.md` — carry the `_run_id` from your first tool result and name yourself (and your parent, if you were spawned).

## Data Source Priority

1. Trade execution framework — `references/execution-scenarios.md` (bundled full execution methodology)
2. Pattern context — from `chart-patterns` skill output (pattern_type, market_condition, timeframe)
3. Market structure — from `price-action` skill output (Always In direction, trend strength)
4. Technical setups — `search_technical_setups` + `get_technical_setup` for exact entry/exit parameters from `gold.technical_setups`

## Methodology

### Retrieval Scope
structured_only

### Retrieval Strategy
This skill follows Branch (d) Simple Lookup from `contracts/retrieval.md`: the execution framework is bundled in `references/execution-scenarios.md`. Real-time price data via `get_realtime_quote`. Matched technical setups via `search_technical_setups` and `get_technical_setup` for detailed execution parameters. No unstructured document retrieval.

### Temporal Scope
See frontmatter temporal_scope block.

### Tool Allowlist
See frontmatter allowed_tools.

### Protocol

This skill implements the price action trading trade execution framework: 12 distinct trading scenarios with specific entry, stop, target, and invalidation rules. The core insight: **MTR failures produce the strongest continuation signals.** Detailed methodology, setup-specific rules, and the full setup→strategy matrix are in `references/execution-scenarios.md`.

This skill follows the **Mode C (Execution-Focused)** retrieval arc per spec 039 Part V.

#### Step 1 — Macro Context (degrade-gracefully)

1. Query `get_realtime_quote` for broad market proxy to assess VIX.
2. VIX > 25 → tighten position sizing (0.5-1% risk per trade), favor defined-risk setups.
3. VIX < 15 → standard sizing (1-2% risk per trade).
4. Macro regime from upstream analysis: expansion favors long setups, contraction favors shorts.

#### Step 2 — Thesis Input

Receive directional thesis from upstream skills:
1. From `price-action`: Always In direction, market condition, trend strength.
2. From `chart-patterns`: Primary pattern type, pattern confidence, secondary patterns.
3. Optional: user-provided thesis direction from fundamental analysis (L2+3 skills).
4. **Conflict resolution**: If fundamental thesis conflicts with technical structure, note the divergence and flag for review. Technical structure takes precedence for entry timing.

#### Step 3 — Setup Selection via MCP (framework-guided)

Match the identified pattern and market condition against `gold.technical_setups`:

```
search_technical_setups(
  pattern_type=<pullback|breakout|reversal|trend_following|range_trading>,
  market_condition=<trending_up|trending_down|ranging>,
  timeframe=<derived from time horizon>,
  instrument_scope=[<equity|option|futures>]
)
```

1. **Filter and rank**: Sort by `research_score` descending. Higher score = more thoroughly researched setup.
2. **Load full setup**: `get_technical_setup(setup_id=<best_match>)` to retrieve complete rules.
3. **Validate against context**: Does the setup's `market_condition` and `pattern_type` match the current analysis?
4. **Fallback**: If no matching setup, use manual execution rules from `references/execution-scenarios.md`. Flag as `coverage_gap`.

#### Step 4 — Execution Plan Construction

Build a complete trade plan by merging methodology with the matched setup's parameters.

**Entry specification**:
- Exact entry trigger: e.g., "Buy stop at $X (1 tick above signal bar high)"
- Alternative entry: e.g., "Or buy market if next bar confirms with strong close"
- MTR failure special case: "Enter market immediately on break back through trend line"

**Stop placement**:
- Primary rule: 1 tick beyond the opposite extreme of the signal bar
- MTR trades: beyond the most recent swing high/low
- Breakout trades: below/above the breakout point
- Adjust stop width to position size: wider stop = smaller size

**Profit targets**:
- Scalp target 1: 1x risk → partial position exit
- Swing target 2: 2x risk or measured move projection → remaining position exit
- Trailing stop: move stop to breakeven after scalp target reached

**Position sizing**:
- Risk per trade = account_risk_pct × capital
- Position size = risk_per_trade / (entry - stop)
- Adjust for VIX: higher VIX → smaller size
- Adjust for setup confidence: higher research_score → larger size (within limits)

**Invalidation conditions**:
- Price closes beyond stop before entry triggers
- Signal bar extreme is violated before the entry bar confirms
- Market context changes (trend breaks, TR forms) before entry
- MTR failure: price resumes reversal instead of continuing

#### Step 5 — Trade Plan Output

Produce the final executable trade plan:

1. **Setup Summary**: Setup name (from MCP), pattern type, confidence level (research_score).
2. **Direction**: Long / Short, Always In alignment.
3. **Entry Plan**: Exact trigger price, alternative entry method, optimal entry window.
4. **Stop Plan**: Exact stop price, stop rationale (which swing point / bar extreme), maximum dollar risk.
5. **Target Plan**: Target 1 (scalp) price and size, Target 2 (swing) price and size, trailing methodology.
6. **Position Size**: Shares/contracts calculated from risk parameters.
7. **Invalidation**: Specific conditions that void the trade before entry.
8. **Post-Entry Management**: When to move stop to breakeven, when to trail, when to exit early.

## Output File

`{ticker}/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_trade-execution_{affix}.md`

## Output Structure

1. **Executive Summary** — Trade direction, setup name, key price levels, confidence
2. **Context Synthesis** — Market structure (price-action), identified pattern (chart-patterns), macro overlay
3. **Setup Selection** — MCP search_technical_setups results, selected setup with research_score, match justification
4. **Entry Plan** — Exact entry trigger price, alternative entry, execution window, volume conditions
5. **Stop Plan** — Exact stop price, stop rationale (which rule applied), maximum dollar/percent risk
6. **Target Plan** — Target 1 (scalp) price and percentage of position, Target 2 (swing) price and percentage, measured move reference
7. **Position Sizing** — Calculated position size, risk per share, total position risk
8. **Invalidation** — Pre-entry invalidation conditions, post-entry stop management rules
9. **Coverage Gaps** — Any data limitations, degraded-mode parameters, setup match caveats

## Error Handling

| Error | Fallback |
|-------|----------|
| No matching setup from MCP | Use manual execution rules from references/execution-scenarios.md; flag coverage_gap |
| `search_technical_setups` unreachable | Proceed with manual rules only; flag all parameters as manually derived |
| Pattern confidence low | Reduce position size by 50%; flag as lower-confidence trade |
| Conflicting upstream signals | Hold; do not trade. Flag conflict for manual review |
| No context from upstream skills | Derive market structure from raw price data where possible; flag degraded |
