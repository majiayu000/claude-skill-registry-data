description: flesh out our plan by filling in gaps and clearly building out the specfification

Let's dial in the spec on this task. Follow our principles and help us come up with a targeted, clean, simple solution easily implemented. Clarify assumptions and adhere to **Elon's 5-Step Algorithm**.

Use **Linear** (via `mcporter`) to create or update the issue. Make sure it begins with a 1-3 sentence summary comprehensible to our non-technical team.

For complex tasks, use `oracle` (which I'll likely reference) to guarantee the best results.

**Context**: find more information by

- asking clarifying questions (more the merrier, encourage me to voice dump)
- examining call recordings in **Notion** (via `mcporter`)
- `Context7` for docs (via `mcporter`)

Elon's 5-Step Algorithm

1. **Make the requirements less dumb**: by questioning every requirement
2. **The best part/process is no part/process**: if you're not occasionally adding back ~10%, you're not deleting enough
3. **Simplify/optimize**: don't optimize something that shouldn't exist
4. **Accelerate cycle-time/efficiency**: don't go fast in the wrong direction
5. **Automate**: don't automate a flawed process
