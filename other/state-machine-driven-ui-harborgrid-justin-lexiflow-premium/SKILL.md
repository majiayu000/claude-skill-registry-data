# State Machine Driven UI

## Summary
Model complex UI flows using finite state machines to ensure deterministic behavior.

## Key Capabilities
- Define strict states.
- Visualize application logic.
- Prevent impossible states.

## PhD-Level Challenges
- Handle parallel states.
- Synchronize state machine context.
- Scale statecharts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Refactor a complex flow.
- Provide a visualization.
- Demonstrate robustness.
