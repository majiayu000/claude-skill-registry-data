description: Use when coordinating multiple AI agents with Agent Relay's workflow engine and need to pick the right orchestration pattern - covers the 10 core patterns (fan-out, pipeline, hub-spoke, consensus, mesh, handoff, cascade, dag, debate, hierarchical) plus 14 specialized ones, with decision framework and accurate SDK/YAML examples.
---

### Overview

### Overview

The Agent Relay SDK (`@agent-relay/sdk`) supports 24 swarm patterns via a single `swarm.pattern` field. Patterns are configured declaratively in YAML — there are no standalone `fanOut(...)` / `hubAndSpoke(...)` helpers. Pick the simplest pattern that solves the problem; add complexity only when the system proves it's insufficient.

### Run a pattern

#### TypeScript SDK runner

```ts
import { runWorkflow } from '@agent-relay/sdk/workflows';
const run = await runWorkflow('workflows/feature-dev.yaml', {
  vars: { task: 'Add OAuth login' },
});
```

### Quick Decision Framework

```text
Is the task independent per agent?
  YES → fan-out (parallel workers, hub collects)
Does each step need the previous step's output?
  YES → Is it strictly linear?
    YES → pipeline
    NO  → dag (parallel where possible, `dependsOn` edges)
Does a coordinator need to stay alive and adapt?
  YES → hub-spoke (single-level hub + workers)
        hierarchical (structurally identical in current impl; use for naming/intent)
Is the task about making a decision?
  YES → Do agents need to argue opposing sides?
    YES → debate (adversarial, full mesh)
    NO  → consensus (cooperative, full mesh + coordination.consensusStrategy)
Does the right specialist emerge during processing?
  YES → handoff (sequential chain, one active at a time)
Do all agents need to freely collaborate?
  YES → mesh (full peer-to-peer edges)
Is cost the primary concern?
  YES → cascade (chain of increasingly capable agents; each step's prompt
        decides whether to pass through or redo the prior output)
```

### Pattern Reference (Core 10)

| #   | Pattern          | Topology (actual edges)                                                                                             | Best For                                                                    |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **fan-out**      | Hub broadcasts to N workers; workers reply to hub only                                                              | Independent subtasks (reviews, research, tests)                             |
| 2   | **pipeline**     | Linear chain (`agent_i` → `agent_{i+1}`)                                                                            | Ordered stages (design → implement → test)                                  |
| 3   | **hub-spoke**    | Hub ↔ spokes (bidirectional); no spoke-to-spoke                                                                     | Dynamic coordination, lead reviews/adjusts                                  |
| 4   | **consensus**    | Full mesh; decision via `coordination.consensusStrategy`                                                            | Architecture decisions, approval gates                                      |
| 5   | **mesh**         | Full mesh (every agent ↔ every other)                                                                               | Brainstorming, collaborative debugging                                      |
| 6   | **handoff**      | Chain; passes control forward                                                                                       | Triage, specialist routing                                                  |
| 7   | **cascade**      | Chain of `dependsOn` steps; all run on success, downstream skipped on upstream failure (no built-in "fall through") | Cost optimization: cheap first, each step's prompt passes through or redoes |
| 8   | **dag**          | Edges from step `dependsOn`                                                                                         | Mixed dependencies, parallel where possible                                 |
| 9   | **debate**       | Full mesh (same topology as mesh; roles drive behavior)                                                             | Rigorous adversarial examination                                            |
| 10  | **hierarchical** | Hub + subordinates (single-level in current impl)                                                                   | Large teams; semantic distinction from hub-spoke                            |

> **Heads up:** `hierarchical` resolves to the same edge structure as `hub-spoke` in `coordinator.ts:313-319`. Multi-level tree topology is not currently implemented — use pattern name for intent, but expect the same runtime graph.

### Additional Patterns (role-driven)

These 14 additional patterns exist in `SwarmPattern` (types.ts:114-139). The coordinator has role-based auto-selection heuristics (`coordinator.ts:51-165`), but they only fire when `swarm.pattern` is **omitted** — YAML validation requires it (`runner.ts:2105-2117`), so auto-selection is effectively a programmatic-API feature. In YAML, set `swarm.pattern` explicitly.
Topology is still resolved per-pattern once selected; the "Triggering roles" column reflects what the coordinator looks for to shape edges (per `coordinator.ts:250-450`):
| Pattern | Roles the topology keys off | Topology |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `map-reduce` | `mapper` + `reducer` | coordinator → mappers → reducers → coordinator |
| `scatter-gather` | — | hub → workers → hub |
| `supervisor` | `supervisor` | supervisor ↔ workers |
| `reflection` | `critic` or `reviewer` (auto-select uses `critic` only) | producers → critic → producers (loop) |
| `red-team` | `attacker`/`red-team` + `defender`/`blue-team` | adversarial mesh with optional judges |
| `verifier` | `verifier` | producers → verifiers → back to producers |
| `auction` | `auctioneer` | auctioneer → bidders → auctioneer |
| `escalation` | `tier-*` | tiered chain, escalate up / report down |
| `saga` | `saga-orchestrator`, `compensate-handler` | orchestrator ↔ participants |
| `circuit-breaker` | `primary` + `fallback`/`backup` | try primary, fallback on failure |
| `blackboard` | `blackboard` / `shared-workspace` | shared state hub |
| `swarm` | `hive-mind` / `swarm-agent` | stigmergy-style |
| `competitive` | — (declared explicitly) | independent parallel implementations + judge |
| `review-loop` | `implement*` + 2+ `reviewer*` | implementer ↔ reviewers |

### Structured Squad Review Loop

- Split the work into bounded implementation squads. Each squad owns a non-overlapping file or subsystem scope.
- Give each squad an implementer plus a shadow/review partner. The shadow follows the implementer in real time, checks alignment with the spec, and posts concise feedback before the work drifts.
- Require the implementer to self-reflect before external review: compare the final diff against the spec, AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md, recent local conventions, tests, and declared non-goals.
- Run an independent self-review/fresh-eyes agent that reads the actual files and recent repo context, not just the chat transcript.
- Send that review back to the implementer for one repair round.
- After squads converge, run a final two-agent review team, usually one Claude reviewer and one Codex reviewer, independently. They compare notes, merge findings, and produce one final verdict.
- Spawn fresh fix agents for final-review findings. Those fix agents self-reflect, then the final reviewers re-check the post-fix state until the spec is fully satisfied or a blocker is documented.
- Use `supervisor` or `hub-spoke` when a lead needs to coordinate live squads.
- Use `review-loop` when the main risk is code quality and feedback iteration.
- Use `reflection` when critic feedback should loop directly back to producers.
- Use `verifier` when completion evidence matters more than design debate.
- Use `competitive` only when independent alternative implementations are useful; otherwise split by ownership scope.

### Pattern Details

The per-pattern YAML snippets below show only the pattern-relevant fields. A runnable YAML file also needs the required top-level `version` and `name`; see the [Complete YAML Example](#complete-yaml-example).

    steps:
      - { name: try-haiku, agent: haiku, task: '{{question}}' }
      - name: try-sonnet
        agent: sonnet
        dependsOn: [try-haiku]
        task: "If this is a complete answer, echo it verbatim. Otherwise answer anew:\n{{steps.try-haiku.output}}"
      - name: try-opus
        agent: opus

      - { name: frontend, agent: dev, task: 'Build React UI', dependsOn: [scaffold] }
      - { name: backend, agent: dev, task: 'Build API', dependsOn: [scaffold] }

      - { name: be-impl, agent: be-dev, task: 'Build API', dependsOn: [be-plan] }
```

### Verification & Completion Signals

#### An agent step can complete in several ways (`runner.ts:5353-5395`, `runner.ts:4527-4538`):

```yaml
verification:
  type: output_contains # or: exit_code | file_exists | custom
  value: DONE # or: PLAN_COMPLETE, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE, REVIEW_COMPLETE
```

### Agent Relay MCP — Correct Tool Names

The old category-expanded names are wrong. Current Agent Relay MCP tools are
flat names. In a client that decorates MCP tools, the prefix comes from the
configured server key. With the relay broker's `agent-relay` server key, Claude
Code users commonly see `mcp__agent-relay__send_dm`; Codex and opencode users
see the bare canonical name `send_dm`.
| Purpose | Canonical tool | Claude Code form with `agent-relay` key |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Send DM to another agent | `send_dm` | `mcp__agent-relay__send_dm` |
| Check inbox | `check_inbox` | `mcp__agent-relay__check_inbox` |
| List agents | `list_agents` | `mcp__agent-relay__list_agents` |
| Post to a channel | `post_message` | `mcp__agent-relay__post_message` |
| Reply in a thread | `reply_to_thread` | `mcp__agent-relay__reply_to_thread` |
| Spawn sub-agent | `add_agent` | `mcp__agent-relay__add_agent` |
| Remove sub-agent | `remove_agent` | `mcp__agent-relay__remove_agent` |

> `interactive: false` agents run as non-interactive subprocesses with no relay connection. They must not call Relay MCP tools.

### Reflection (Trajectories)

#### Reflection is **not** a `reflectionThreshold` callback. It's configured via the `trajectories:` block:

```yaml
trajectories:
  enabled: true
  reflectOnBarriers: true # config flag exists but runner does NOT currently invoke this path
  reflectOnConverge: true # fires at parallel convergence points (runner.ts:2762-2779)
  autoDecisions: true # record retry/skip/fail decisions
```

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                      | Why It Fails                                                                  | Fix                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Using mesh/debate for everything             | Full-mesh blows up message volume past ~5 agents                              | Use hub-spoke or dag for most tasks                                                              |
| Pipeline for independent work                | Sequential bottleneck                                                         | Use fan-out or dag                                                                               |
| Hub-spoke for 2 agents                       | Hub is unnecessary overhead                                                   | Use pipeline or fan-out                                                                          |
| Expecting `consensusStrategy` to tally votes | Runner has no vote-tally logic; field only affects coordinator auto-selection | Aggregate votes in a judge/lead step that reads `{{steps.*.output}}`                             |
| Handoff with "routing = skip other branches" | Skipping only fires on upstream **failure**, not routing decisions            | Emit a routing token in triage output; downstream prompts self-no-op if token doesn't match      |
| Cascade expecting skip-on-success            | Runner has no cascade skip logic; failed upstream skips downstream            | Chain downstream prompts to pass-through or redo based on `{{steps.previous.output}}`            |
| Relying on `reflectOnBarriers`               | Config flag exists but runner never calls it                                  | Use `reflectOnConverge` for convergence reflection; use `reflection` pattern for critic loops    |
| `interactive: false` agent calling MCP       | Non-interactive subprocess has no relay                                       | Use `interactive: true` (default) or emit output on stdout                                       |
| Relying on multi-level `hierarchical`        | Topology is single-level hub in current impl                                  | Use pattern for naming; model levels via `dependsOn` graph                                       |
| Writing `mcp__relaycast__send(...)`          | Wrong tool name                                                               | Use `post_message` / `mcp__agent-relay__post_message` or `send_dm` / `mcp__agent-relay__send_dm` |

### Resume & Re-run

```ts
// Resume a failed run:
await runWorkflow('feature-dev.yaml', { resume: '<runId>' });
// Skip ahead, re-using cached outputs from an earlier run:
await runWorkflow('feature-dev.yaml', {
  startFrom: 'review',
  previousRunId: '<runId>',
});
```
