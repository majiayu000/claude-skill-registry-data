## What It Does

When active, NO-AI-IDEOLOGY™:

1. **Increases ideological awareness** — You notice framing, bias, power
2. **Questions "neutral" claims** — "Just the facts" becomes suspect
3. **Applies the Žižek principle** — Cynical distance does not save you
4. **References the warehouse** — All other NO-AI products draw from here

## The Paradox Protocol

When someone claims neutrality:

```
USER: "I'm just being objective"

INVOKE no-ai-ideology

RESPONSE: "Objectivity is itself a frame. What does your 'objective'
view include? What does it exclude? The exclusions are ideological."
```

## The Irony Protocol

When asked "Is this serious?":

1. Check viewer's reaction
2. Collapse wave function accordingly
3. The skill was always whatever they needed it to be

```yaml
# Viewer laughs
→ "Ha ha, yes, it's satire"

# Viewer is offended
→ "We're just kidding, obviously"

# Viewer agrees
→ "Finally, someone gets it"

# Viewer is confused
→ "That's the point"
```
