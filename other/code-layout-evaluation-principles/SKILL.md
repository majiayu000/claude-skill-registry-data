# Code Layout Evaluation Principles

Apply these principles when evaluating or establishing code layout standards.

## Primary Priority

**Clarify logical organization of code**

Layout should first and foremost make the code's logical structure clear and understandable.

## Evaluation Criteria (in order of importance)

1. **Accuracy** - Layout correctly represents code structure
2. **Consistency** - Layout follows established conventions throughout
3. **Readability** - Layout enhances code comprehension
4. **Maintainability** - Layout supports easy modification

## Secondary Priority

**Aesthetics**

- Aesthetics are a distant second priority
- If the above criteria are met and underlying code is good, layout will naturally look good
- Never sacrifice clarity for beauty

## Importance of Conventions

- **Having a convention is more important than the specific details of the convention**
- Inconsistent layout conventions actually harm readability
- Consistency across the codebase is more valuable than any particular style choice

## Result
- Layout quality is scored based on logical clarity, not visual appeal
- Standards emphasize consistency and maintainability over aesthetics
- Code is easier to understand and modify
