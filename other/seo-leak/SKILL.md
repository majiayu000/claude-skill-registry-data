# SEO Leak Engine Skill

## Overview

The SEO Leak Engine is the **competitive SEO intelligence center**. It:
- Estimates Google's ranking signals (Q*, P*, T* factors)
- Analyzes NavBoost (user behavior) signals
- Evaluates E-E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
- Identifies ranking gaps vs. competitors
- Orchestrates comprehensive SEO audits
- Provides actionable SEO strategy recommendations

Based on research into Google's ranking factors and signals, the engine provides deeper competitive intelligence than traditional SEO tools.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Google Ranking Signals (Q*, P*, T*)

**Query Signal (Q\*)** - What's the user searching for?
```
COMPONENTS:
- Query intent: informational, navigational, commercial, transactional
- Query language: exact match, semantic variations, long-tail
- Query freshness: real-time (news), evergreen (permanent), seasonal
- Query authority: brand searches, expert searches, general searches

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS:
Query: "best project management software for startups"
- Intent: Commercial (comparing products)
- Freshness: Evergreen with seasonal variations (Q1/Q4)
- Authority: Review sites, startup blogs, tools comparison
- Opportunity: Content comparison guides, ROI calculators

How to use:
- Understand what Google thinks the user wants
- Align content to that intent
- Create content only if you can satisfy intent better than competitors
```

**Page Signal (P\*)** - How well does this page answer?
```
COMPONENTS:
- Content quality: depth, uniqueness, accuracy
- Content type: blog post, product page, comparison, guide
- Content freshness: when was it last updated?
- Content structure: headers, sections, readability
- Content format: text, video, interactive, images
- Page load speed: Core Web Vitals, first byte time
- Mobile optimization: responsive, tap targets, viewport

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS:
Competitor ranking for "project management software for startups"
- Title: "Best Project Management Tools for Startups (2025)"
- Word count: 4,200 words
- Sections: 12 tools reviewed with pros/cons
- Images: 24 (tool screenshots, UI demos)
- Video: 2 embedded reviews (8 min, 12 min)
- Updates: 7 updates in past 12 months
- CWV: 89/100
- Mobile: 95/100

Signal Assessment:
- Content completeness: STRONG (covers many tools)
- Freshness: STRONG (regularly updated)
- UX: STRONG (videos, images, structure)
- Speed: GOOD (needs improvement)

What you need to beat this:
- More tools (add 15-20, not just 12)
- Better UX (faster load, better interactive demo)
- More regular updates (quarterly vs. annual)
- Better video (high-quality, custom reviews)
```

**Trust Signal (T\*)** - Can Google trust this source?
```
COMPONENTS:
- Author credentials: expertise, credentials, experience
- Site authority: backlinks, domain age, traffic
- Site safety: no malware, SSL certificate, no hacking history
- Topical authority: content in this topic area
- Update frequency: is content kept fresh?
- User feedback: reviews, ratings, comments
- Citation consistency: mentioned across web consistently

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS:
Your site vs. competitor (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius)
- Domain age: Competitor 15 years, you 2 years (disadvantage)
- Backlinks: Competitor 45k, you 1.2k (large gap)
- Mentions: Competitor in major publications, you in niche blogs
- Author: Competitor has staff writers with bylines, you single author
- Updates: Competitor posts weekly, you post monthly

Gap Analysis:
- Author credibility: Build author bios, credentials pages
- Site authority: Earn 500+ quality backlinks (via PR, partnerships)
- Topical authority: Publish 50+ articles in next 6 months
- Fresh content: Shift to weekly publishing cadence

Realistic timeline to close gap: 12-18 months
```

### 2. NavBoost Signal Analysis

**What is NavBoost?**
NavBoost is Google's aggregated user behavior signal - how users interact with search results.

**Components:**
```
CLICK-THROUGH RATE (CTR)
- What % of searchers click your result?
- Why: Higher CTR = more relevant
- Factors: Title quality, snippet clarity, SERP position

ENGAGEMENT
- Do users stay on your page?
- Why: Longer dwell time = more helpful
- Factors: Content quality, page speed, structure

POGO-STICKING
- Do users return to Google?
- Why: Returning means result wasn't what they wanted
- Factors: Content doesn't match intent, poor UX, outdated info

SKIP RATE
- Do users skip your result for others?
- Why: Users prefer alternatives
- Factors: Competitors have better content, your snippet is unclear

HOW TO MEASURE:
- GSC CTR: Actual clicks / impressions
- Dwell time: Analytics session duration
- Bounce rate: Users leaving without action
- Search return rate: Users going back to search

OPTIMIZATION:
1. CTR: Improve title tags and meta descriptions
   - Make headlines compelling
   - Add numbers, power words
   - Include relevant keywords

2. Engagement: Keep users on page
   - Lead with value in first 100 words
   - Use subheadings for scanability
   - Add interactive elements (table of contents)
   - Include images and videos
   - Improve page speed

3. Anti-pogo: Match search intent perfectly
   - Understand what searchers actually want
   - Update if search intent changed since you ranked
   - Add competitor comparison if needed

4. Skip rate: Analyze competitor advantages
   - Read top 3 ranking pages
   - Note: unique elements they have
   - Add those elements + your differentiation
```

### 4. Ranking Gap Analysis

**Gap framework:**
```
STEP 1: IDENTIFY TARGET KEYWORDS
- Keywords your business should rank for
- Keywords your competitors rank for
- Keywords you currently DON'T rank for

STEP 2: ANALYZE TOP 3 COMPETITORS
For each keyword they rank for:
- What's their title? (template)
- How long is their content? (word count)
- What sections do they have?
- What unique elements? (tools, data, video)
- What's their backlink profile?
- What's their E-E-A-T?

STEP 3: YOUR CONTENT AUDIT
For each keyword you target:
- Do you have content for this keyword?
- How does it compare to top 3 competitors?
- What's missing from your version?
- How fresh is your content?

STEP 4: GAP SUMMARY
```

**Example gap analysis:**
```
TARGET KEYWORD: "Best Project Management Software for Startups"

CURRENT RANKING:
- You: Not in top 20 (gap = potentially valuable)
- Competitor 1 (G2): Position 2
- Competitor 2 (Capterra): Position 3
- Competitor 3 (TrustRadius): Position 5

GAP ASSESSMENT:

1. CONTENT COMPLETENESS
   Competitor 1:
   - 25 tools reviewed
   - 4,200 words
   - 8 sections (overview, features, pricing, reviews, etc.)
   - 24 images
   - 2 videos

   You:
   - Not ranked (potential: 30+ tools, 5,000+ words)
   - Gap: Need comprehensive comparison guide

2. SEARCH INTENT COVERAGE
   Competitor 1: Covers "best for startups" vs. "best for enterprises"
   Competitor 2: Includes pricing comparison table
   Competitor 3: Includes ROI calculator

   You: Could combine all three + add something unique
   Gap: Interactive comparison tool, ROI calculator

3. E-E-A-T
   Competitor 1: 50 author contributors, strong authority
   Competitor 2: Industry reviews, strong social proof
   Competitor 3: Original research, unique data

   You: New site, no established authority
   Gap: Build author credibility, get user reviews, original research

4. BACKLINK PROFILE
   Competitor 1: 45k backlinks from 8k unique domains
   Competitor 2: 32k backlinks from 6.5k unique domains
   Competitor 3: 28k backlinks from 5k unique domains

   You: 1.2k backlinks from 340 domains
   Gap: Need 10x+ backlinks (1-2 years of link-building)

RANKING DIFFICULTY: EXTREME
- These are huge sites with massive authority
- Backlink gap: 25-37x larger
- Better strategy: Target long-tail, less competitive keywords first

2. Build from there: Publish 30 articles on adjacent keywords
3. Earn backlinks through partnerships and PR
4. After 12 months: Revisit the main keyword

This path gives you 80%+ chance of success vs. 20% going direct."
```

### Workflow 2: Our Page Isn't Ranking - Why?

```
Your URL: yoursite.com/best-project-management
Competitor ranking #1: g2.com/categories/project-management

SEO Leak Engine Analysis:

P* GAP (Page Quality):
- They: 6,500 words, 12 sections, 30 tools, video reviews
- You: 2,100 words, 4 sections, 8 tools, no video

2. Add video reviews (3-5 minutes each)
3. Add 15+ more tools to comparison
4. Update content (it's 8 months old)
