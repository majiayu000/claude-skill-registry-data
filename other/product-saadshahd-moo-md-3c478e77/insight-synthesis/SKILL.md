# Insight Synthesis Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Wrapping up research studies, surveys, or ongoing feedback programs.
- Preparing executive readouts or roadmap recommendation docs.
- Aligning cross-functional stakeholders on prioritized issues/opportunities.

## Framework
1. **Signal Stacking** – layer qualitative quotes, quantitative metrics, and behavioral data for each insight.
2. **Theme Laddering** – cluster related findings into parent themes, mapping to personas and journeys.
3. **Impact Assessment** – estimate business impact (ARR, adoption, satisfaction, efficiency) and confidence level.
4. **Recommendation Crafting** – outline proposed actions, owners, and success metrics.
5. **Storytelling** – build narrative arcs with hooks, evidence, and clear calls to action.

## Templates
- Insight card (context, signal evidence, impact, recommendation).
- Executive summary outline with top themes and action table.
- Appendix structure for quotes, charts, and methodology notes.

## Tips
- Keep verbatim quotes close to stats to reinforce credibility.
- Use visual cues (heatmaps, journey overlays) to help audiences grasp patterns quickly.
- Pair with `stakeholder-ops` to ensure follow-up actions are logged and tracked.
