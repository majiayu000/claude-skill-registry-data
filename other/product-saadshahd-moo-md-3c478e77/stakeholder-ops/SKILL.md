# Stakeholder Operations Guide Skill

## When to Use
- Launching surveys, betas, or listening tours that require multi-team approvals.
- Routing insights to product, CS, marketing, and exec stakeholders with clear accountability.
- Ensuring follow-up communications and governance rituals stay on track.

## Framework
1. **Stakeholder Map** – list involved teams, decision rights, and expectations per stage.
2. **Approval Workflow** – define checkpoints (brief sign-off, launch approval, readout review) with timelines.
3. **Communication Plan** – specify audiences, channels, frequency, and owners for updates.
4. **Action Tracking** – set up shared trackers with status, blockers, and success metrics.
5. **Governance Rituals** – outline cadences (weekly syncs, monthly reviews) plus escalation paths.

## Templates
- RACI chart for research + activation workflows.
- Approval checklist with required artifacts (brief, QA results, comms plan).
- Meeting agenda + notes template to keep stakeholders aligned.

## Tips
- Keep stakeholder rosters fresh; note backups for vacations or org changes.
- Automate reminders linked to due dates via project/workflow tools.
- Pair with `insight-synthesis` outputs to ensure narrative consistency.
