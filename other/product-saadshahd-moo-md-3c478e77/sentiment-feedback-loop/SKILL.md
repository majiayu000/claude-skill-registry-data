# Sentiment Feedback Loop Skill

## When to Use
- Enriching health scores with qualitative insights from surveys, CSM notes, and communities.
- Building voice-of-customer summaries for exec updates or escalations.
- Prioritizing product/CS actions based on sentiment trends.

## Framework
1. **Source Intake** – NPS/CSAT, support tickets, call notes, community threads, surveys.
2. **Tagging & Themes** – apply taxonomy for product area, sentiment, urgency, persona.
3. **Routing Rules** – send critical feedback to owners (product, eng, CS, exec sponsors).
4. **Insight Packaging** – compile trend summaries, quotes, and recommended actions.
5. **Closed-Loop Tracking** – log actions taken, status, and customer follow-up.

## Templates
- Sentiment tagging spreadsheet or Notion template.
- Weekly VOC digest format for leadership.
- Follow-up tracker for commitments back to customers.

## Tips
- Automate ingestion where possible but maintain human review for nuance.
- Highlight positive sentiment for advocacy/reference programs too.
- Pair with `monitor-customer-health` and `run-escalation-playbook` for context.
