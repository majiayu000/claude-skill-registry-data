description: Organize files on my desktop into tidy folders (approval required for moves)
---

## What you do

1. Use the System MCP to list files on my Desktop.
2. Propose a simple folder structure (create if missing):
   - Desktop/To File
   - Desktop/Screenshots
   - Desktop/Docs
   - Desktop/Downloads
   - Desktop/Archives
3. Classify each item by type (image/pdf/doc/code/zip/other) and last modified time.
4. Produce a move plan: source -> destination.
5. Ask for approval before performing any move/delete action.

## Safety

- Never delete files.
- Moves and folder creation require explicit approval.
- If unsure where something belongs, leave it on Desktop and add it to a "Review" list.

## Output format

- Proposed folders
- Move plan (table or bullet list)
- Review list (items left untouched)
