# Blue Ocean Skill

Discovering uncontested market spaces in search.

## Heat Signature Scanning

### Sources to Mine
- **Adjacent problems**: What do people search before/after?
- **Question mining**: Reddit, Quora, PAA (People Also Ask)
- **Emerging trends**: Google Trends, news alerts
- **Underserved segments**: Strata managers, property managers
- **Format gaps**: Video where others do text
- **Language opportunities**: Non-English speakers in AU

## Opportunity Scoring

```
Score = (Volume × Growth × Gap) / Competition

80+  → IMMEDIATE ACTION (Blue Ocean found)
60-79 → HIGH PRIORITY
40-59 → QUEUE
<40  → MONITOR
```

### Scoring Factors

**Volume**: Monthly search volume (0-100)
**Growth**: YoY growth rate (0-100)
**Gap**: Content quality gap (0-100)
**Competition**: Number of strong competitors (inverse)

## Discovery Process

1. **Scan**: Review adjacent searches, PAA, forums
2. **Analyze**: Calculate opportunity scores
3. **Validate**: Check actual search volume (GSC, SEMrush)
4. **Prioritize**: Sort by score, filter by feasibility
5. **Execute**: Create content, optimize, dominate

## Red Flags (Skip These)

- Declining trends
- Saturated competition (10+ strong players)
- Low commercial intent
- Outside expertise area
- Regulatory/legal minefields

## Australian Market Focus

Prioritize:
- Brisbane-specific opportunities
- Queensland regional markets
- Strata/body corporate (uniquely Australian)
- Insurance-specific (AU regulations)
