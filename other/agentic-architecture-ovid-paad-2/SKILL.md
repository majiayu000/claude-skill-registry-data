description: Use when assessing the architectural health of a codebase — before a major refactor, when onboarding to an unfamiliar repo, after rapid growth, when planning a redesign, or to surface structural strengths and risks before they become expensive. Not for fixing what it finds, and not for reviewing a branch diff.

# Agentic Architecture Analysis

Multi-agent architecture analysis of the current codebase. Dispatches specialist agents in parallel — each focused on a different architectural domain — verifies findings to filter false positives, and produces a balanced report of strengths and flaws with concrete evidence.

**Do NOT propose fixes.** This is diagnosis only.

**This is a technique skill.** Follow the phases in order. Do not skip verification.

**Pre-flight:**

```dot
digraph preflight {
  "Conversation has history?" [shape=diamond];
  "Proceed to Phase 1" [shape=box];
  "STOP: recommend new session" [shape=box, style=bold];

  "Conversation has history?" -> "STOP: recommend new session" [label="yes"];
  "Conversation has history?" -> "Proceed to Phase 1" [label="no"];
}
```

**Analysis flow:**

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **You already have a recent report** — re-running burns a session to regenerate what you have. Read the existing report in `.reviews/architecture/` and use `fix-architecture`, which handles staleness itself.
- **The scope is a handful of files** — architecture is about boundaries and relationships between components. Below that scale there's no structure to assess, and the report will pad.

## Arguments

`agentic-architecture` accepts optional `$ARGUMENTS`:

- `agentic-architecture` — analyze the entire repository
- `agentic-architecture src/` — scope the analysis to a specific directory (useful for monorepos or analyzing one service)
- `agentic-architecture packages/api/ packages/shared/` — analyze multiple directories together

When a path is provided, focus the analysis on that scope but still note dependencies on code outside the scope.

## Pre-flight Checks

1. **Context window:** If conversation has substantive history beyond invoking this skill, tell the user: "This analysis consumes significant context. Start a fresh session with `agentic-architecture` to avoid context rot." Stop and wait.

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance

Run these steps and collect results:

1. **Repo identification:**
   - Detect if this is a git repo (`git rev-parse`)
   - Determine repo name from `git remote get-url origin` (strip `.git`, take last segment) or basename of top-level directory
   - Set output filename accordingly

2. **Repo overview:**
   - Identify primary languages/frameworks
   - Identify key directories (`apps/`, `services/`, `packages/`, `src/`, `lib/`, etc.)
   - Estimate size: number of services/modules/packages

3. **Dependency & structure snapshot:**
   - Top-level modules/packages and their relationships
   - Quick import graph via heuristics (look for cross-layer imports, circular patterns)
   - Note positive structure signals (clean layering, bounded contexts)

4. **Scan for steering files:** `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, architecture docs, ADRs

5. **Estimate scope size:**
   - **Small:** <50 source files
   - **Medium:** 50-500 source files
   - **Large:** 500+ source files

6. **Build manifest:** source files grouped for specialists, annotated with module/package boundaries

**Steering file caveat:** Include in every agent prompt: "Steering files (CLAUDE.md, etc.) describe conventions but may be stale. If you find a contradiction between steering files and actual code, flag it as a finding."

## Phase 2: Specialist Analysis (Parallel)

Dispatch these agents simultaneously using the Agent tool. Each receives: the file manifest, repo overview, steering file contents, and their specialist focus.

### Specialists

| Agent | Domain | Flaw types | Strength categories |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Structure & Boundaries** | Module organization, responsibility distribution, domain modeling | 1 (global mutable state), 2 (god object), 9 (shotgun surgery), 10 (feature envy/anemic domain), 11 (low cohesion), 13 (inconsistent boundaries), 29 (utility dumping ground) | S1 (modular boundaries), S2 (cohesion), S13 (domain modeling), S14 (pragmatic abstractions) |
| **Coupling & Dependencies** | How components connect, abstraction quality, dependency direction | 3 (tight coupling), 4 (high/unstable deps), 5 (circular deps), 6 (leaky abstractions), 7 (over-abstraction), 8 (premature optimization), 23 (DI misuse), 27 (temporal coupling) | S3 (loose coupling), S4 (dependency direction), S5 (dep management hygiene) |
| **Integration & Data** | Service communication, data ownership, API contracts, resilience | 14 (distributed monolith), 15 (chatty calls), 16 (sync-only integration), 17 (no data ownership), 18 (shared database), 19 (lack of idempotency), 24 (inconsistent API contracts), 26 (poor transactional boundaries) | S6 (consistent API contracts), S12 (resilience patterns) |
| **Error Handling & Observability** | Error strategies, logging, config, side effects, business logic placement | 12 (hidden side effects), 20 (weak error handling), 21 (no observability), 22 (config sprawl), 25 (business logic in UI), 28 (magic numbers/strings), 34 (inconsistent error/logging) | S7 (robust error handling), S8 (observability), S9 (config discipline) |
| **Security & Code Quality** | Auth, secrets, dead code, test coverage | 30 (security as afterthought), 31 (dead code/unused deps), 32 (missing test coverage), 33 (hard-coded credentials) | S10 (security built-in), S11 (testability & coverage) |

### Agent prompt template

Each specialist agent prompt must include:
- The file manifest for their scope
- Repo overview and structure snapshot
- Steering file contents with the staleness caveat
- Their assigned flaw types and strength categories with descriptions
- Instruction: "You are an architecture specialist focused on [DOMAIN]. Find both **strengths** and **flaws** in the assigned categories. For each finding report: the category (flaw type number or strength category), file:line, a short label, 1-2 sentence explanation, concrete evidence (path, symbol, excerpt), impact level (High/Medium/Low), and your confidence (0-100). Only report findings with confidence >= 60. Validate every candidate by reading the actual code — do not infer from file names alone. Do not modify any file in the repository. You may run read-only commands (existing tests, linters, type checkers) unchanged — their caches, coverage files, and build output are fine. If confirming a finding would require changing code, do not — cap that finding's confidence at 79 and state what would confirm it."

**Structure & Boundaries additional instruction:** "Look for: module-level mutable variables, singletons, static mutables; very large classes/files with high fan-in/fan-out; single logical changes requiring edits across many files; business logic in services while domain objects are just data bags; modules grouping unrelated behaviors; drifting responsibilities between layers; generic helper modules growing into grab-bags. Also look for the positive: clean module organization, high cohesion, strong domain modeling, pragmatic abstractions."

**Coupling & Dependencies additional instruction:** "Look for: concrete instantiations instead of abstractions, core depending on leaf modules, circular imports, abstractions requiring callers to know internals, excessive layers/interfaces for uncertain future needs, architecture optimized without evidence, DI obscuring control flow, components requiring specific call order. Also look for the positive: clean interfaces, stable dependency direction, minimal circular deps, consistent import conventions."

**Integration & Data additional instruction:** "Look for: microservices with heavy synchronous coupling, too many small network calls, everything requiring immediate responses, multiple services writing same data, services coupled through shared schemas, non-idempotent operations, API contracts without compatibility discipline, operations spanning systems without strategy. Also look for the positive: consistent API versioning, resilience patterns (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, backpressure). If this is not a distributed system, mark distributed-specific categories as Not applicable."

**Error Handling & Observability additional instruction:** "Look for: functions doing more than signatures suggest, errors swallowed or over-generalized, missing logs/metrics/traces, scattered configs with unclear precedence, critical rules in frontend code, hard-coded magic values, inconsistent error/logging formats across services. Also look for the positive: consistent error taxonomy, structured logging with correlation IDs, centralized config, safe defaults."

**Security & Code Quality additional instruction:** "Look for: auth bolted on late, secrets in source, missing trust boundaries, unused packages/files/modules, unreachable code, stale feature flags, critical paths without tests. Also look for the positive: authN/Z patterns, secret management, least privilege, tests around critical paths, good test seams, deterministic tests."

**Refactor history instruction (include in all agent prompts):** "Before flagging a candidate flaw, use `git log --oneline` on the relevant files/directories to check whether the current code is the result of recent intentional work. A large file with many recent commits may be a completed refactor, not a neglected problem. Intentional design choices can still be flawed — check history to understand context, not to dismiss findings."

**Scaling for large codebases (500+ source files):** Partition files across 2 instances of each specialist.

## Phase 3: Verification

After all specialists complete, dispatch a single **Verifier** agent using the Agent tool, passing all findings. The verifier:

1. For each finding, reads the actual current code at the referenced file:line
2. Confirms the strength or flaw exists and is accurately described
3. Drops false positives and findings below 60% confidence
4. Validates that the impact level (High/Medium/Low) is appropriate
5. Checks that the correct flaw type or strength category is assigned
6. Deduplicates findings flagged by multiple specialists (note which specialists agreed — cross-specialist agreement increases confidence)
7. Ensures every finding has concrete evidence (file path, symbol, excerpt) — drops findings without evidence

**Verifier prompt must include:** "You are verifying architecture findings. For each finding, read the actual code and confirm the strength or flaw exists. Be skeptical — file size alone doesn't make a god object, and many imports don't necessarily mean tight coupling. Check git history for context. A finding reported by multiple specialists is more likely real. Drop anything you cannot confirm by reading the code. Do not modify any file in the repository. You may run read-only commands (existing tests, linters, type checkers) unchanged — their caches, coverage files, and build output are fine. If confirming a finding would require changing code, do not — drop it under that same rule, rather than lowering its confidence or impact level."

## Phase 4: Report

Write verified findings to `.reviews/architecture/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<git-repo-name>-architecture-report.md`.

Create the `.reviews/architecture/` directory if it doesn't exist.

**Report template:**

```markdown
# Architecture Report — <repo-name or current folder>

- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Commit:** <full-sha>
- **Languages:** <primary languages/frameworks>
- **Key directories:** <list>

## Common Mistakes

These patterns produce low-quality architecture analyses. Avoid them:

| Mistake | What to do instead |
|---------|-------------------|
| Single-agent analysis | Always dispatch 5 specialist agents in parallel — each architectural domain has unique concerns |
| Skipping verification | Always run verifier — file size and import count alone don't prove architectural problems |
| Inferring from names alone | Read the actual code — a file called `utils.py` might be well-organized, and `UserService` might be a god object |
| Ignoring git history | Check whether code is the result of recent intentional refactoring before flagging it |
| Proposing fixes | This is diagnosis only — describe what exists and why it matters, not what to do about it |
| Missing evidence | Every finding must include file:line, symbol name, and excerpt — unanchored findings are not actionable |
| Only reporting flaws | Strengths are equally important — they tell teams what to protect and what patterns to follow |
| Applying distributed system patterns to monoliths | Mark distributed-specific categories as Not applicable when reviewing a monolith |
| Counting lines as proof | A 500-line file might be perfectly cohesive; a 50-line file might violate single responsibility — analyze content, not metrics |

## Post-Analysis

After writing the report:
1. **List every file this run wrote or changed, before anything else** — a
   report the developer does not know exists is a report nobody reads. One line
   per path, each marked new or updated, even when there is only one:

   ```
   Files written or updated:
     new      .reviews/architecture/architecture-2026-08-01-10-42-13.md
   ```

   Then give the finding counts (strengths and flaws by impact level)
2. Print a brief summary (3-6 bullet points) of the highest-impact strengths and risks
3. Do **not** propose fixes. The report is the deliverable.
