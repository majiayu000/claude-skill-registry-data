# LinkedIn DM Outreach

## Purpose

Write personalized LinkedIn messages — connection requests, InMails, and
follow-up messages — that get responses instead of being ignored. Every
message must demonstrate genuine relevance: why THIS person, why NOW,
why the user is worth responding to.

## Voice Loading

Load the user's voice via voice-master's overlay resolution before drafting:

1. Read `../voice-master/SKILL.md` and follow its **User Calibration
   Overlay** section to load exemplars and voice-dimensions from the
   out-of-repo overlay (or template fallback with warning if no overlay).
2. This skill's medium is `professional`. Select professional-medium
   exemplars from whatever voice-master loads.
3. Read `../voice-master/references/anti-slop.md` — apply the **Universal**
   and **Professional / LinkedIn** sections.

If no overlay is present, voice-master falls back to generic voice guidance
and warns — note this in your output.

DMs are the most personal LinkedIn format — sounding templated here is
fatal. One bad outreach message can permanently close a door.

## Message Types

### Connection Request (300 characters max)

The hardest format. 300 characters to establish relevance and earn a click.

**Rules:**
- Name a specific reason for connecting (shared interest, their content,
  mutual connection, specific role/company)
- No generic "I'd love to add you to my network"
- No pitching in the connection request — ever
- If there's no genuine reason to connect, don't send the request

**Structure:** "[Specific reference to them or their work]. [Why connecting
makes sense for both sides — in one sentence]."

### First Message (after connecting)

Sent after a connection request is accepted, or to an existing connection.

**Rules:**
- Thank them for connecting (brief, not gushing)
- Reference something specific about them or their work
- State your reason for reaching out clearly
- Ask one specific question or make one specific offer
- Keep under 150 words — respect their time
- No "I hope this message finds you well"
- No walls of text about yourself

**Structure:**
- Line 1: Brief genuine acknowledgment
- Line 2-3: Why you're reaching out (specific, relevant)
- Line 4: One clear ask or offer

### Follow-Up Message

If the first message got no response after 5-7 days.

**Rules:**
- Maximum ONE follow-up. Two unanswered messages = they're not interested.
- Add new value — don't just "bump" or "circle back"
- Shorter than the first message
- No guilt ("I know you're busy but...")
- Accept that silence is an answer

### Warm Introduction Request

Asking a mutual connection to introduce you to someone.

**Rules:**
- Make it easy for the introducer — provide a brief, forwardable blurb
- Explain why the introduction makes sense for all three parties
- Never pressure — "only if you think it makes sense"

## Research Integration

Before drafting any outreach, gather intelligence on the recipient:

- Their recent posts and content (what they care about)
- Their current role and company (what they're dealing with)
- Mutual connections (potential introduction path)
- Shared interests or background (common ground)
- Their company's recent news (relevant context)

If the `prospect-researcher` skill has already run on this target, use
its findings. If not, perform lightweight research before writing.

## Outreach Scenarios

### Job Search
**Goal:** Get a conversation about opportunities.
**Approach:** Lead with what you can do for them, not what you want.
Reference specific challenges their company/team faces. Ask about the
team or the work, not about open positions directly.

### Client Acquisition
**Goal:** Start a relationship that could lead to business.
**Approach:** Never pitch in the first message. Offer genuine value first
(insight, introduction, resource). Build rapport before discussing services.
The goal is a conversation, not a sale.

### Networking
**Goal:** Build a genuine professional relationship.
**Approach:** Reference specific shared interests or complementary
expertise. Suggest a concrete (low-commitment) next step — a specific
article exchange, a brief call, a shared event.

### Recruiting / Hiring
**Goal:** Attract a candidate.
**Approach:** Lead with why you noticed THEM specifically (not "we have
an exciting opportunity"). Be transparent about the role and company.
Respect that they may not be looking.
