# Real Estate Analyst

Comprehensive real estate analysis system designed for investors, agents, property managers, and developers evaluating residential and commercial properties. This skill provides detailed financial modeling, market analysis, property valuation, investment return calculations, and risk assessment to support informed real estate decisions.

The Real Estate Analyst excels at analyzing rental properties for cash flow and appreciation potential, comparing investment opportunities, evaluating market trends, calculating key metrics (cap rate, cash-on-cash return, IRR), performing comparative market analysis, and building detailed financial projections. It's valuable for buy-and-hold investors, fix-and-flip projects, commercial property evaluation, and portfolio optimization.

**Important Note:** Real estate analysis requires current market data, local market expertise, and on-the-ground property inspection. This skill provides analytical frameworks and financial modeling; always verify assumptions, gather local market data, conduct physical inspections, and consult with real estate professionals before making investment decisions.

- **Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)** = Purchase Price / Annual Gross Rent
  - Quick screening metric
  - Lower is better; compare to market average
- **1% Rule** = Monthly Rent / Purchase Price
  - Monthly rent should be 1%+ of purchase price
  - Quick screening tool
- **50% Rule** = Operating expenses ≈ 50% of gross rent
  - Rough estimate for screening

**6. Long-Term Projections**

## Best Practices

### Due Diligence Excellence
- **Physical inspection is mandatory** - Never buy sight unseen; hire professional inspectors
- **Verify rent assumptions** - Call comparable properties to confirm actual rents, don't trust online estimates
- **Underwrite conservatively** - Use realistic vacancy rates (8-10%), maintenance (1-2% of value annually)
- **Build in contingencies** - Expect unexpected costs; budget 10-20% contingency for renovations
- **Check zoning and permits** - Verify intended use is permitted and no code violations exist

### Financial Modeling Standards
- **Use consistent assumptions** - Document all assumptions and sources
- **Run sensitivity analysis** - Test best case, base case, worst case scenarios
- **Include all costs** - Don't forget closing costs, HOA, CapEx reserves, property management
- **Be realistic about timeline** - Renovations take longer than expected; factor holding costs
- **Account for taxes** - Consider income tax on rental income and capital gains on sale

### Market Analysis Rigor
- **Use recent comps** - Properties sold 6+ months ago may not reflect current market
- **Quality over quantity** - 3 excellent comps better than 10 mediocre ones
- **Adjust systematically** - Document why each adjustment is made and methodology
- **Know the micro-market** - Same zip code can have vastly different submarkets
- **Trust data, not emotions** - Don't fall in love with a property; let numbers guide you

### Risk Management
- **Maintain reserves** - 6 months of expenses minimum for rental properties
- **Diversify** - Don't put all capital into one property or one market
- **Insurance adequacy** - Proper coverage for property, liability, loss of income
- **Legal protection** - LLC or other entity structure to protect personal assets
- **Exit strategy** - Know how you'll get out before you get in

### Investment Criteria (Set Your Standards)
**Rental Properties:**
- Minimum cash-on-cash return: 8-12%+
- Minimum cap rate: 6-10%+ (varies by market)
- Maximum price: Meets 1% rule or local equivalent
- Debt service coverage ratio: 1.25+ (income covers debt by 25%+)
- Location: B or better neighborhoods (A=best, D=worst)

**Fix-and-Flip:**
- Minimum ROI: 15-20%+
- Maximum purchase: 70% rule or better
- Holding period: <6 months ideal
- ARV confidence: High (multiple solid comps)
- Renovation scope: Within your expertise/contractor capability

## Key Metrics Explained

### Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)
**Formula:** Cap Rate = Net Operating Income (NOI) / Purchase Price
**Meaning:** Unlevered return on property; what you'd earn if bought with cash
**Use:** Compare similar properties; higher cap rate = higher return but often higher risk
**Ranges:** Residential 4-10%, commercial 5-12%, varies greatly by market and property quality

### Cash-on-Cash Return
**Formula:** Cash-on-Cash = Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested
**Meaning:** Actual cash return on the money you put in (down payment + closing costs)
**Use:** Measure leveraged return; shows power of financing
**Target:** 8-12%+ for strong deal; lower acceptable in high-appreciation markets

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
**Meaning:** Time-weighted return accounting for all cash flows over holding period
**Use:** Compare investments with different holding periods and cash flow patterns
**Calculation:** Complex; requires financial calculator or spreadsheet
**Target:** 15-20%+ for value-add deals; 10-15% for stable cash flow

### Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)
**Formula:** GRM = Purchase Price / Annual Gross Rent
**Meaning:** How many years of rent to pay back purchase price
**Use:** Quick screening tool; compare to market average GRM
**Interpretation:** Lower is better; GRM of 10 = 10 years of rent = purchase price

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
**Formula:** DSCR = Net Operating Income / Annual Debt Service
**Meaning:** How well income covers mortgage payments
**Use:** Lender requirement; risk assessment
**Standard:** Lenders typically require 1.20-1.25+ (income 20-25% higher than debt)

### Return on Investment (ROI)
**Formula:** ROI = (Net Profit / Total Investment) × 100
**Meaning:** Total return as percentage of invested capital
**Use:** Overall profitability assessment
**Annualized:** Adjust for holding period to compare different durations

## Property Types & Considerations

### Single-Family Residences
**Pros:** Easy to finance, broad buyer pool, low management complexity
**Cons:** Vacancy = 100% loss, single point of failure, slower to scale
**Best for:** First-time investors, long-term buy-and-hold

### Multi-Family (2-4 units)
**Pros:** Residential financing, vacancy diversification, easier to scale
**Cons:** More management intensive, higher purchase price
**Best for:** Growing portfolio, investors wanting cash flow and scale

### Apartments (5+ units)
**Pros:** Best for scaling, commercial appraisal (valued on income), professional management
**Cons:** Commercial financing, higher capital requirement, complexity
**Best for:** Experienced investors, syndications, full-time operators

### Condos/Townhouses
**Pros:** Lower price point, amenities included, limited exterior maintenance
**Cons:** HOA fees and restrictions, special assessments, harder to finance for investors
**Best for:** High-demand urban areas, limited capital

### Commercial (Retail/Office/Industrial)
**Pros:** Longer leases, tenant pays expenses (NNN), higher cap rates
**Cons:** Economic sensitivity, specialized knowledge required, larger capital
**Best for:** Sophisticated investors, diversification from residential
