description: Build structured 3-scenario financial models (Base / Bull / Bear) for business planning or investment decisions. Sensitize revenue and cost drivers across scenarios, produce P&L summaries, cash flow bridges, and executive narratives. Aligns with FP&A 2.0 and CIMA Management Accounting standards. Use when leadership needs to understand the financial impact range of a decision. Do not use for statutory financial reporting or audit-ready financials.

# FP&A Scenario Modeling

## Purpose

Transform business assumptions into a structured 3-scenario financial model that gives leadership a clear view of upside, baseline, and downside outcomes.

## When to use

- annual or quarterly business planning cycle
- before a major investment decision (new product, M&A, expansion)
- when the CFO asks "what if revenue drops 20%?"
- presenting financial impact range to the board

## When not to use

- statutory financial reporting (IFRS/GAAP compliance)
- audit-ready financial statements
- daily operational cost tracking

## Inputs

- business model type (SaaS, retail, manufacturing, services)
- historical financials (last 2–3 years if available)
- key revenue drivers (pricing, volume, churn, expansion)
- key cost drivers (headcount, COGS, marketing spend, capex)
- specific decision context (what are we modeling?)
- time horizon (12 months, 3 years, 5 years)

## Procedure

1. **Define 3 scenarios**:
   - Base Case: most likely outcome based on current trajectory
   - Bull Case: upside scenario (best 30% of outcomes)
   - Bear Case: downside/stress scenario (worst 20% of outcomes)
2. **Identify key variables to sensitize**:
   - Revenue-side: growth rate, gross margin, CAC, churn rate, ASP
   - Cost-side: fixed cost base, variable cost as % revenue, capex, working capital (DSO, DPO, DIO)
3. **Build scenario assumption table** — side-by-side comparison of all variables across 3 scenarios.
4. **Calculate P&L summary** per scenario: Revenue → Gross Profit → EBITDA → Net Profit.
5. **Build cash flow bridge** per scenario: Operating CF → Investing CF → Financing CF → Free CF.
6. **Calculate key metrics** per scenario: EBITDA margin, ROI, Payback Period, Break-even point.
7. **Create sensitivity table** — identify which single variable has the largest impact on outcome.
8. **Write executive narrative** — "Under the base case, the business generates…" with clear decision implications.

## Output

- scenario assumption table (side-by-side, 3 columns)
- P&L summary per scenario (Revenue → EBITDA → Net Profit)
- cash flow bridge per scenario
- key metrics comparison table
- sensitivity analysis (which variable moves the needle most)
- executive narrative (1–2 paragraphs per scenario)

## Definition of done

- all 3 scenarios have distinct, justified assumptions
- P&L, cash flow, and key metrics are calculated for each scenario
- sensitivity analysis identifies the top 3 swing variables
- executive narrative is decision-ready (not just numbers)

## Examples

- "Model 3 scenarios for our SaaS expansion into Southeast Asia over 3 years."
- "What happens to EBITDA if raw material costs increase 15% (bear case)?"
- "Build a scenario model for the board comparing organic growth vs. acquisition."

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Data sources and assumptions are explicitly stated
- [ ] Calculations are reproducible from provided inputs
- [ ] Visualizations or tables have clear labels, units, and time ranges
- [ ] Caveats and confidence levels are documented for estimates

## Verification (4C)

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Are formulas, aggregations, and statistical methods applied correctly? |
| **Completeness** | Does the analysis cover all requested metrics and time ranges? |
| **Context-fit** | Are the chosen metrics relevant to the business question being answered? |
| **Consequence** | If this data were used for a decision today, what blind spots remain? |

## Edge Cases

- **Missing or incomplete data** — Document gaps and their potential impact on conclusions. Provide ranges instead of point estimates.
- **Outliers skewing results** — Report with and without outliers. Document the decision to include or exclude.
- **Changing data definitions mid-period** — Split analysis at the change boundary and note the schema difference.
