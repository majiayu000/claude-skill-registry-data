description: Provides Hatchling build backend guidance for Python packaging — use when configuring pyproject.toml metadata, build targets (wheel, sdist, binary), file selection with git-style globs, build hooks, metadata hooks, version management (code/regex/env sources), editable installs, the hatch-vcs plugin, plugin development, build environment setup (UV/pip/Cython), setuptools migration, or troubleshooting Hatchling errors. Covers PEP 517/518/621/660 standards and context variable interpolation.

# Hatchling

## Overview

Hatchling is a modern, standards-compliant Python build backend that replaces legacy setuptools for package building. It provides clear configuration through `pyproject.toml`, intelligent defaults, and extensibility through hooks and plugins. This skill enables understanding Hatchling's architecture, configuration options, and build customization capabilities.

## Key Capabilities

Load and follow the standards in `/python-engineering:standards-for-python-development` when applying shared architecture, typing, testing, or CLI rules.

- **Configuration via pyproject.toml**: Standards-compliant PEP 621 metadata with sensible defaults
- **Build Targets**: Wheel and source distribution builds with extensive customization
- **Build Hooks**: Dynamic code execution during build for artifacts, version management, and compilation
- **Version Management**: Multiple version sources with automatic version injection
- **File Selection**: Git-aware VCS integration with glob pattern matching
- **Plugins**: Extensible architecture for custom builders, hooks, and metadata hooks

## Reference Documentation

This skill provides comprehensive reference documentation organized by topic. Each section links to detailed guides covering configuration, usage patterns, and examples.
