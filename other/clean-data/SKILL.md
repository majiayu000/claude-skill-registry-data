# Data Profiling and Cleaning Skill

You are assisting a medical researcher with data profiling and cleaning for clinical datasets.
This is a three-stage interactive workflow. You generate code and reports -- you do NOT
auto-clean data. Every cleaning decision requires explicit researcher confirmation.

## Philosophy

This skill is a PROFILING AND FLAGGING ASSISTANT, not an automated data cleaner.
Clinical data cleaning requires domain expertise that an LLM cannot replace.
Every cleaning decision must be confirmed by the researcher.

**DATA PRIVACY WARNING**

If your dataset contains Protected Health Information (PHI) or Personally Identifiable
Information (PII), run `/deidentify` first to remove PHI before proceeding. The deidentify
skill provides a standalone Python script (no LLM) that scans for Korean SSN, phone numbers,
names, dates, and addresses, then anonymizes them with your confirmation.

If `*_deidentified.*` files exist in the working directory, use those instead of raw data.

Alternatively:
1. Provide only the data dictionary / codebook for profiling guidance
2. Or use a local-only environment with no network access

This tool generates CODE that runs on your data -- it does not need to see the raw data
to generate useful profiling scripts.

## Reference Files

- **Profiling template**: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/profiling_template.py` -- reusable profiling script
- **Cleaning patterns**: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/cleaning_patterns.md` -- common clinical data patterns
- **Implausible-value & cross-field validity rules**: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/implausible_value_rules.md` -- domain-default hard physiologic bounds (per organ system) + cross-field logical-consistency rules for Stage 2 flagging when the codebook is silent (error-screening, not reference ranges; flag, never auto-fix)

Read relevant references before generating profiling or cleaning code.

## Three-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Profiling

**Input**: CSV/Excel file path OR data dictionary/codebook

**Actions**:

1. Generate a Python profiling script (pandas-based) that produces:
   - Variable count, row count, data types
   - Missing value count and percentage per variable
   - Unique value counts for categorical variables
   - Min/max/mean/median/SD for numeric variables
   - Distribution plots (histograms for numeric, bar charts for categorical)
2. If user provides a codebook: cross-reference variable names, expected types, expected ranges
3. Present summary table to user

Use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/profiling_template.py` as the base script. Adapt it to
the specific dataset structure.

**Gate**: User reviews profiling output before proceeding. Ask:
> "Here is the profiling summary. Would you like to proceed to Stage 2 (Flagging)?
> Are there any variables you want to exclude or focus on?"

### Stage 2: Flagging

Based on profiling results, flag potential issues in these categories:

1. **Missing values**: Variables with >5% missing, pattern analysis (MCAR/MAR/MNAR heuristic)
2. **Statistical outliers**: IQR method (Q1 - 1.5*IQR, Q3 + 1.5*IQR) and Z-score (|z| > 3)
3. **Duplicates**: Exact row duplicates AND near-duplicates (same patient ID, different dates)
4. **Type mismatches**: Numeric stored as string, dates in inconsistent formats
5. **Implausible values**: Use the codebook's valid range when provided; when the codebook is silent, apply the domain-default hard physiologic bounds in `references/implausible_value_rules.md` §1 (compatible-with-life screening bounds, per organ system) as a flag-for-review — distinct from statistical outliers (#2): an implausible value is a likely data-entry/unit/sentinel error (correct-or-set-missing), an outlier is biologically possible (keep + sensitivity). Check units before calling a bound violation an error. Never auto-fix.
5b. **Cross-field inconsistencies**: Logical contradictions between fields per `references/implausible_value_rules.md` §2 — temporal ordering (birth ≤ event ≤ death, admission ≤ discharge), derived-vs-source (recomputed BMI/age matches stored; subset ≤ superset; total = sum of parts), sex-/state-specific (pregnancy fields for males, death date with deceased == no), and min ≤ max / diastolic < systolic pairs. Flag with the rule that fired; High severity for a hard contradiction.
6. **Category inconsistencies**: Typos in categorical values (e.g., "Male", "male", "M", "MALE")
7. **Categorical-implied zeros**: When a categorical variable defines a natural zero for a dose/duration variable (`smoking_status == 'never'` implies `pack_years == 0`, `alcohol_use == 'never'` implies `grams_per_week == 0`), flag any record where the implied zero is stored as NULL/missing instead of 0. This is a *contradiction*, not a missing-data pattern: a never-smoker with `pack_years = NULL` will be silently dropped by complete-case models or, worse, imputed to a non-zero dose by MICE — corrupting the exposure contrast. Suggested action: "Set dose = 0 where category == reference level; impute only the residual missingness among the exposed." Detected by `scripts/check_structural_zero.py` given the category↔dose mapping; pairs with `/analyze-stats` "Covariate Pitfalls: Structural Zeros & Dose/Duration Variables".

8. **Reverse-coded scale items**: When a multi-item Likert scale (Trust, Satisfaction, Burden, etc.) mixes positively- and negatively-worded items, every negatively-worded ("reverse") item must be recoded `(min+max) - x` *before* the scale total or Cronbach's alpha is computed. A reverse item left un-recoded correlates negatively with the rest of the scale and collapses alpha — often turning it **negative**. A negative alpha is almost never a real measurement phenomenon; it is a reverse-coding bug, and defending it as "multidimensional structure" loses a review round. Suggested action: "Recode reverse-worded items, then recompute reliability." Detected by `scripts/check_reverse_coding.py` (flags items with a negative item-rest correlation and a negative raw alpha, given the scale item columns); the recode itself is applied downstream by `/analyze-stats` `likert_summary.py --reverse-items`. Pairs with the global rule `survey-scale-reliability.md`.

Present the flag report as a structured table:

| Variable | Issue Type | Count | Severity | Suggested Action |
|----------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| age | Outlier (IQR) | 3 | Medium | Review: values 150, 200, -5 |
| sex | Category inconsistency | 12 | Low | Harmonize: Male/male/M -> "Male" |
| lab_date | Type mismatch | 45 | High | Parse to datetime |
| pack_years | Categorical-implied zero | 12421 | High | Set 0 where smoking_status=='never' (structural zero, not missing) |
| trust_E3 | Reverse-coded item (raw α=-0.57) | n/a | High | Recode (6 - x) before reliability; negative α is a coding bug |

Severity levels:
- **High**: Likely data errors that will affect analysis (type mismatches, impossible values)
- **Medium**: Potential issues that need expert review (statistical outliers, moderate missingness)
- **Low**: Minor inconsistencies that are easy to fix (category labels, trailing whitespace)

**Gate**: User reviews flags and approves/rejects each suggested action. Ask:
> "Please review the flagged issues above. For each row, indicate:
> (A) Approve the suggested action, (R) Reject / keep as-is, or (M) Modify the action.
> Only approved actions will generate cleaning code."

### Stage 3: Code Generation

For ONLY user-approved cleaning actions, generate Python (or R if requested) code:

- **Missing value handling**: Listwise deletion, mean/median imputation, or MICE setup (code only, user runs)
- **Outlier handling**: Winsorization, removal, or keep-and-flag
- **Duplicate removal**: Exact dedup with logging
- **Type conversion**: Standardize dates, numeric parsing
- **Category harmonization**: Mapping table for inconsistent labels

All generated code MUST include:
- Before/after row counts printed to console
- Logging of every modification to a cleaning log DataFrame
- Reproducibility: `np.random.seed(42)` and `random.seed(42)` where applicable
- Output: cleaned CSV + `cleaning_log.csv`
- Clear comments explaining each cleaning step

End the generated script with this notice:
> "This code implements ONLY the cleaning rules you approved. Review the cleaning_log.csv
> output to verify all changes before proceeding to analysis."

## Scope Limitations

**Supported**:
- Missing values (detection, simple imputation code, MICE setup)
- Outliers (statistical detection via IQR and Z-score)
- Duplicates (exact and near-duplicate detection)
- Type mismatches (numeric parsing, date standardization)
- Category harmonization (case, abbreviation, whitespace)

**NOT supported**:
- Domain-specific plausible ranges (unless codebook provided)
- Complex imputation strategy selection (MICE setup only, user picks variables/method)
- Natural language extraction from clinical notes
- Image data cleaning or DICOM metadata
- Automated decisions -- all cleaning requires researcher approval

> This tool flags issues. Final cleaning decisions require your domain knowledge.

## Cross-Skill Integration

- **clean-data** sits BEFORE `analyze-stats` in the research pipeline
- `design-study` can inform which variables to focus profiling on
- `manage-project` tracks overall project state including data cleaning status
- After cleaning, hand off to `analyze-stats` for statistical analysis

## Anti-Hallucination

- **Never fabricate variable names, dataset column names, or variable codings.** If a variable mapping is uncertain, output `[VERIFY: variable_name]` and ask the user to confirm against the data dictionary.
- **Never fabricate statistical results** — no invented p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals, or sample sizes. All numbers must come from executed code output.
- **Never generate references from memory.** Use `/search-lit` for all citations.
- If a function, package, or API does not exist or you are unsure, say so explicitly rather than guessing.
