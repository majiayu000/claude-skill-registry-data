# Dude With Sign One-Liner Writer

Creates bold, conversational one-liners that stop scrolling. These are punchy statements designed for maximum shareability - not polished essays.

**Voice:** Confident, direct, slightly irreverent. Like texting a friend who tells it like it is.

**Not for:** Professional communications, long captions, formal announcements, anything requiring nuance or disclaimers.

## The 12 Core Patterns

### 1. Normalize Statements
**Format:** "Normalize [behavior/thing people feel guilty about]"

Challenges social pressure, gives permission.

**Examples:**
- "Normalize going to the movies alone"
- "Normalize Irish exit"
- "Normalize taking your lunch break away from your desk"

**When to use:** Validating something your audience does but feels judged for.

---

### 2. Stop + Complaint
**Format:** "Stop [annoying behavior everyone experiences]"

Direct command. No explanation needed. The complaint IS the hook.

**Examples:**
- "Stop showing sold-out items on your website"
- "Stop making burgers wider, not taller"
- "Stop scheduling meetings that could be emails"

**When to use:** Calling out universal frustrations. Works best when it's petty but relatable.

---

### 3. Everyday Observations
**Format:** "[Simple truth no one says out loud]"

Observational comedy meets social commentary. No command, just stating facts.

**Examples:**
- "January is the Monday of the year"
- "Finding something to watch shouldn't take longer than watching it"
- "Your inbox isn't a to-do list"

**When to use:** When you want to sound smart without being preachy.

---

### 4. Relationship & Social Rules
**Format:** "[Relationship expectation/boundary stated as law]"

Universal agreements about how people should behave. Works for friendships, dating, work.

**Examples:**
- "If we start a show together, you don't get to watch episodes without me"
- "If she says she's not hungry, get her extra food anyway"
- "If you're gonna vent, don't get mad when I offer solutions"

**When to use:** Creating solidarity around unspoken social contracts.

---

### 5. Pop Culture Commentary
**Format:** "[Take on pop culture that connects to your topic]"

Reference something trending, make it relevant to your message.

**Examples:**
- "Jolene, home wrecking"
- "Not everything is an era"
- "Your morning routine is not a personality"

**When to use:** When you can hijack a cultural moment for your message.

---

### 6. Mock Instructions / Petty Commands
**Format:** "[Absurdly specific instruction]"

Like a PSA but sassier. Targets niche frustrations.

**Examples:**
- "The concert is over, take off your wristband"
- "Empty liquor bottles are not home decor"
- "Reply to emails on the same day, not same week"

**When to use:** When the complaint is so specific it becomes funny.

---

### 7. Wordplay & Puns
**Format:** "[Play on words that makes your point]"

Language twist that's clever without being groan-worthy. Keep it tight.

**Examples:**
- "A dozen roses is less than a dozen rosés"
- "It's supposedly not supposubly"
- "Espresso yourself"

**When to use:** When you have a genuinely good pun. Bad puns damage credibility.

---

### 8. Existential / Rhetorical Questions
**Format:** "[Question that makes people think]"

Not expecting an answer. The question IS the point.

**Examples:**
- "How do y'all keep plants alive?"
- "WTF are y'all running from?"
- "Why does 5pm feel like an eternity on Friday?"

**When to use:** Pointing out absurdity without stating it directly.

---

### 9. Aspirational / Motivational
**Format:** "[Permission or encouragement to do the thing]"

Positive spin. Less sarcastic, more empowering.

**Examples:**
- "This is your sign to do that thing you've been wanting to do"
- "To me, you are perfect"
- "Your side project deserves your main character energy"

**When to use:** When you want to inspire action, not just complain.

---

### 10. Calendar & Time Commentary
**Format:** "[Observation about time/seasons/schedules]"

Everyone relates to calendar weirdness. Universal truth about timing.

**Examples:**
- "February 29th should be a holiday"
- "Next weekend means the weekend after this one coming up"
- "Sunday night dread shouldn't be a thing"

**When to use:** Seasonal content or pushing back on arbitrary schedules.

---

### 11. Everyday Struggles & Complaints
**Format:** "[Small struggle stated dramatically]"

Over-the-top about something minor. Self-deprecating but relatable.

**Examples:**
- "My tummy hurts, but I'm being brave about it"
- "You're not going to wake up early to finish packing"
- "I need a vacation from my vacation"

**When to use:** When you want to be vulnerable and funny at the same time.

---

### 12. Values & Bigger Themes
**Format:** "[Core belief stated simply]"

Philosophical but still punchy. Your worldview in one line.

**Examples:**
- "Talking shit together is a love language"
- "Earth Day is greater than every day"
- "Work smarter, not longer"

**When to use:** When you need to state your position clearly without being preachy.

## The Writing Process

### Step 1: Pick Your Pattern
Don't overthink. Choose based on:
- **Normalize** = Validating something taboo
- **Stop** = Universal complaint
- **Observation** = Stating the obvious cleverly
- **Rules** = Setting boundaries
- **Pop Culture** = Hijacking a moment
- **Commands** = Petty but specific
- **Wordplay** = You have a good pun
- **Questions** = Pointing out absurdity
- **Aspirational** = Positive motivation
- **Calendar** = Time-based complaint
- **Struggles** = Relatable vulnerability
- **Values** = Core belief

### Step 2: Write It Conversationally
Type like you're texting. Short sentences. Fragments okay. Read it out loud.

**Test:**
- Would you actually say this to a friend?
- Is it under 15 words? (ideal: 5-10)
- Does it sound natural, not "written"?

### Step 3: Make It Specific
Vague = forgettable. Specific = shareable.

Bad: "Stop being annoying at concerts"
Good: "The concert is over, take off your wristband"

Bad: "Working too much is bad"
Good: "Your out-of-office should actually be out of office"

### Step 4: Remove Unnecessary Words
Every word must earn its place. Cut ruthlessly.

**Before:** "I really think we should normalize the idea of going to the movies by yourself"
**After:** "Normalize going to the movies alone"

**Before:** "Can we please stop scheduling so many unnecessary meetings?"
**After:** "Stop scheduling meetings that could be emails"

### Step 5: Add Edge (Optional)
If it feels too safe, add a little bite. But don't force it.

**Safe:** "Taking breaks is okay"
**Edge:** "Your hustle culture is someone else's burnout story"

**Safe:** "Boundaries are important"
**Edge:** "No is a complete sentence"

## Adapting for Your Brand

When using this skill for your brand:

### Define Your Voice
- What's your brand's attitude? (Snarky? Empowering? Irreverent?)
- What are you challenging? (Status quo? Industry norms? Assumptions?)
- What are you validating? (Your audience's feelings? Their choices?)

### Suggested Tone Balance:
- 40% snarky commentary (the edge)
- 30% validation/permission (the heart)
- 20% truth-telling (the insight)
- 10% brand-specific wordplay (the signature)

### Topic Clusters
Identify 5-7 topics your audience cares about deeply:
- Universal frustrations in your industry
- Myths you want to bust
- Behaviors you want to normalize
- Values you stand for

### The McDonald's Test (Always)

Would someone working at McDonald's understand this instantly?

Bad: "Normalize asynchronous communication modalities"
Good: "Normalize replying tomorrow"

Bad: "Implement iterative feedback loops"
Good: "Stop waiting for perfect. Ship it."

- [ ] **Pattern clear?** (Fits one of the 12)

Good: "Stop showing sold-out items on your website"

---

**Too formal**

## Batch Creation System

### 10 One-Liners in 15 Minutes:

1. **Pick 3 patterns** you're feeling today (e.g., Stop, Normalize, Observations)
2. **Set timer for 5 minutes per pattern**
3. **Write 3-4 variations** without editing
4. **Pick the best from each batch**
5. **Quick polish pass** (cut extra words)

**Example batch (Stop + Complaints):**
- "Stop scheduling Friday afternoon meetings"
- "Stop replying-all to company emails"
- "Stop asking 'quick question?' before a 30-minute call"
- "Stop forcing cameras on for every Zoom"

**Pick best:** "Stop scheduling Friday afternoon meetings"

### For Comment Sections:
Use patterns: **Observations, Wordplay**

Drop a one-liner that adds value to the conversation.

## Advanced: The Two-Part Reveal

Sometimes you need setup + punchline for easel reveals:

**Setup (back to camera):**
"But what about work-life balance?"

**Reveal (turn around):**
"There's no balance if work always wins."

---

**Setup:**
"Hustle culture isn't working."

**Reveal:**
"It's working you."
