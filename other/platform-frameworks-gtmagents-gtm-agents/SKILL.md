# Platform Frameworks Skill

## When to Use
- Planning multi-channel campaigns requiring platform-specific nuances.
- Reviewing calendars to ensure each post follows best practices.
- Coaching contributors unfamiliar with a platform's culture or specs.

## Framework

### Platform Cadence & Formats
| Platform | Cadence | Format Tips | CTA Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LinkedIn | 3-5x/week | Lead with insight, use whitespace, add doc carousel | Invite comments + resource download |
| X (Twitter) | Daily | Hooks < 50 chars, thread sequencing, emoji sparingly | Ask for RT/quote or drive to thread |
| TikTok/Reels | 3-4x/week | Hook in 2s, captions, native text, trending audio | Soft CTA spoken + on-screen |
| Instagram | 4-5x/week | Carousel storytelling, Reels for reach, alt text | DM or link-in-bio prompts |

### Publishing Checklist
- ✅ Dimensions + aspect ratios correct.
- ✅ Hook formula applied (stat + POV, question, contrarian take).
- ✅ Hashtags limited (2-4 contextual) unless discovery platform (TikTok).
- ✅ Accessibility: captions, alt text, color contrast.
- ✅ Native scheduling tools or approved third-party scheduler used.

## Templates
- Hook bank by platform
- CTA formulas (conversation, traffic, conversion)
- Asset spec sheet (dimensions, length, safe zones)

## Tips
- Maintain a “what broke” doc capturing algorithm shifts or new creative restrictions per platform.
- Refresh cadence guidance quarterly based on performance data and inventory.
- Pair platform calendars with campaign briefs so creative intent is clear to contributors.
- Use A/B hooks every week to keep prospecting fresh while respecting each platform’s etiquette.
