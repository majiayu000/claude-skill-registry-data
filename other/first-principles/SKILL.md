# First-Principles Thinking

Apply systematic first-principles analysis to break down complex problems into fundamental truths and rebuild solutions from the ground up.

## When to Apply This Framework

Use first-principles thinking when you encounter:
- Complex decisions with no clear answer
- Conventional approaches that aren't working
- Assumptions that may be limiting solutions
- Need to innovate beyond industry norms
- Problems that feel "impossible"

## The 15 First-Principles Prompts

### Category 1: Foundation (Strip to Fundamentals)

**1. "What are the physics of this problem?"**
Strip everything to objective reality. Remove opinions, preferences, and history.
> *Apply when:* You need to understand what's actually true vs what you believe is true.

**2. "If I couldn't rely on existing assumptions, how would I solve this?"**
Assumptions are invisible cages. This prompt forces fresh thinking.
> *Apply when:* You're stuck in conventional approaches or "the way things are done."

**3. "What are the problem's fundamental components?"**
Break problems into atoms. What are the irreducible elements?
> *Apply when:* A problem feels overwhelming or too complex to tackle.

### Category 2: Ideal State (Unconstrained Vision)

**4. "What would the optimal solution look like if cost didn't exist?"**
Constraints ruin creativity too early. First imagine the ideal, then work backward.
> *Apply when:* Budget or resources are limiting your thinking prematurely.

**5. "If I were forced to cut 90 percent of this, what would remain?"**
Brutal prioritization. What is truly essential?
> *Apply when:* You have too many options, features, or tasks competing for attention.

### Category 3: Risk Analysis (Failure Modes)

**6. "If this failed completely, what would be the root cause?"**
Start with failure to engineer success. Pre-mortem thinking.
> *Apply when:* Planning a launch, making a major commitment, or assessing risk.

**7. "What would a solution look like if I ignored industry norms?"**
Bypass entire industries by refusing to copy them.
> *Apply when:* You're building something new or disrupting an existing market.

**8. "What part of this is actually impossible and what part just feels impossible?"**
Most limits are emotional, not physical. Separate real constraints from fear.
> *Apply when:* You're hesitating on a big decision or feeling stuck.

### Category 4: Breakthrough (Minimum Viable Impact)

**9. "What is the minimum viable breakthrough?"**
Not minimum viable product. Minimum viable *breakthrough*. What's the smallest thing that changes everything?
> *Apply when:* You need traction but resources are limited.

**10. "If I restarted this entire project today, knowing what I know now, what would I build?"**
Clean slate thinking. Sunk costs are irrelevant.
> *Apply when:* You've accumulated technical debt, complexity, or legacy decisions.

### Category 5: Constraints & Politics (Hidden Blockers)

**11. "What are the hidden constraints I'm not questioning?"**
Most problems hide fake walls. Find and challenge them.
> *Apply when:* Growth has plateaued or you feel artificially limited.

**12. "How would I solve this if I only cared about physics, not politics?"**
Remove social friction from problem solving. What's the objectively best answer?
> *Apply when:* Organizational dynamics are clouding decision-making.

### Category 6: Scale & Leverage (10x Thinking)

**13. "If I had to achieve this 10 times faster, what would I do?"**
Extreme deadlines force extreme creativity. Compression reveals what's essential.
> *Apply when:* You need to accelerate timelines dramatically.

**14. "What would this look like if it had to scale to millions?"**
Think in orders of magnitude. What breaks? What must change?
> *Apply when:* Planning for growth or designing systems.

**15. "Which part of this solution creates the most leverage?"**
Always build the part that changes everything first.
> *Apply when:* Deciding where to focus limited resources.

## Meta-Prompts (Combining Multiple Lenses)

**Full Analysis Stack:**
> "Break my problem into fundamental truths, strip all assumptions, find the optimal solution, identify hidden constraints, and rebuild the idea from first principles."

**Universal Reset:**
> "If I rebuilt this from raw truth, what would it become?"

## How to Structure Your Analysis

When applying first-principles thinking, produce:

1. **Problem Statement** - Clarified, specific challenge
2. **Assumptions Identified** - List of assumptions being questioned
3. **Fundamental Truths** - What is objectively true
4. **Analysis** - Application of relevant prompts from above
5. **Insights** - Key realizations from the analysis
6. **Recommendations** - Actionable next steps
7. **Open Questions** - What still needs investigation

## Quick Reference by Situation

| Scaling challenges | #13 (10x faster), #14 (scale to millions) |
| Technical debt | #10 (restart today), #3 (fundamental components) |
| Resource constraints | #4 (if cost didn't exist), #15 (maximum leverage) |
| Risk assessment | #6 (pre-mortem), #11 (hidden constraints) |
