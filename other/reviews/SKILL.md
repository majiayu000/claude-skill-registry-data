name: prbuddy:reviews
description: Triages PR review comments by fixing critical ones (with systematic prevention) and converting nitpicks to tracked GitHub issues. Use when a PR has unresolved review comments, changes have been requested, or the user says "address feedback", "reviewer asked", "changes requested", or "triage reviews".

# prbuddy:reviews

## Overview

Discovers and triages PR review comments. Fixes critical issues (aligned with PR goals) and creates GitHub issues for nitpicks (valid but out of scope).

**Requires:** `gh-pr-review` extension

```bash
gh extension install agynio/gh-pr-review
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get PR Context and Repo Info

```bash
# Get repo slug for -R flag
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)

# Get PR number
PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)

# Get PR details
gh pr view --json number,title,body,closingIssuesReferences
```

Extract:
- **Repo slug** (`$REPO`) for commands requiring `-R`
- **PR number** (`$PR_NUM`) for thread operations
- **PR goals** from title and body
- **Linked issues** from `closingIssuesReferences`

These define what's "critical" vs "nitpick".

### Step 2: Fetch Review Threads

```bash
gh pr-review threads list --unresolved --not_outdated -R $REPO $PR_NUM
```

This returns unresolved, non-outdated review threads.

### Step 3: Triage Each Comment

For each thread, classify:

**CRITICAL** if comment relates to:
- Linked issues (`closingIssuesReferences`)
- Goals stated in PR title/body
- Security vulnerabilities (always critical)
- Breaking changes to public API

**NITPICK** if comment:
- Suggests improvements unrelated to PR goals
- Points out style issues not enforced by linters
- Proposes refactoring beyond PR scope
- Asks questions not requiring code changes

### Step 4: Handle Critical Comments

For each critical comment:

#### 4a: Analyze the Feedback

Read the comment carefully. Understand what the reviewer wants.

#### 4b: Consult PAL

```
mcp__pal__chat: "Review comment analysis:

Reviewer said: [comment text]
PR goal: [from PR body/linked issues]
Code context: [relevant file/function]

What's the best fix approach considering the reviewer's expertise?"
```

**If `mcp__pal__chat` is unavailable:** Analyze the reviewer's comment directly against the PR goal and linked issues. Read the referenced code, identify the clearest fix that satisfies the reviewer's concern, and proceed to 4c without PAL consultation.

#### 4c: Implement Fix

Make the code changes.

#### 4d: Identify Prevention

What systematic change would prevent this class of issue?

See CLAUDE.md for the prevention hierarchy.

#### 4e: Commit

```bash
git add [files]
git commit -m "fix: [description] (addresses review)

- Fixed: [what was fixed]
- Prevention: [systematic change]"
```

#### 4f: Reply to Thread

```bash
gh pr-review comments reply \
  --thread-id <thread-id> \
  --body "Fixed in [commit].

Changes:
- [what was changed]

Prevention added:
- [systematic change]" \
  -R $REPO $PR_NUM
```

#### 4g: Resolve Thread (Optional)

**Note:** Some teams prefer only reviewers resolve their own threads. Ask the user before resolving, or skip this step if team norms require reviewer resolution.

```bash
gh pr-review threads resolve --thread-id <thread-id> -R $REPO $PR_NUM
```

### Step 5: Handle Nitpick Comments

For each nitpick comment:

#### 5a: Search for Duplicates

```bash
gh search issues --repo $REPO "<search terms from comment>"
```

Check if similar issue already exists.

#### 5b: Create Issue (if no duplicate)

Determine appropriate labels:

```bash
gh label list -R $REPO --json name,description
```

If needed label doesn't exist:

```bash
gh label create "from-review" --color "c5def5" --description "Created from PR review comment" -R $REPO
```

Create the issue:

```bash
gh issue create -R $REPO \
  --title "<concise title>" \
  --body "## Context

From PR #$PR_NUM review by @<reviewer>.

## Original Comment

> <quoted comment>

## Suggested Action

<what should be done>

## Related

- PR: #$PR_NUM
- File: <path>
- Line: <line number>" \
  --label "from-review,<type-label>"
```

**Type labels:**
- `tech-debt` - Refactoring suggestions
- `documentation` - Doc improvements
- `enhancement` - Feature suggestions
- `good-first-issue` - Simple fixes

#### 5c: Reply to Thread

```bash
gh pr-review comments reply \
  --thread-id <thread-id> \
  --body "Good catch! This is outside the scope of this PR (focused on [PR goal]).

Created issue #<number> to track this." \
  -R $REPO $PR_NUM
```

#### 5d: Resolve Thread (Optional)

**Note:** Some teams prefer only reviewers resolve their own threads. Ask the user before resolving, or skip this step if team norms require reviewer resolution.

```bash
gh pr-review threads resolve --thread-id <thread-id> -R $REPO $PR_NUM
```

### Step 6: Push Changes

```bash
git push
```

### Step 7: Report Summary

```
Review Comments Handled

Critical (fixed):
- @reviewer1 on src/api.ts:23 - Added input validation [commit abc123]
