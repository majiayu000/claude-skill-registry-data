# OLI Paradigm (Dunning, 1977): Eclectic Theory of FDI

## Overview

The OLI Paradigm explains why firms engage in foreign direct investment (FDI) rather than exporting or licensing. Three conditions must hold simultaneously: the firm possesses Ownership advantages (proprietary assets), the foreign Location offers advantages over the home market, and Internalization is preferable to market-based transactions (licensing/franchising). The configuration of OLI advantages also determines the FDI mode.

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- User is deciding whether to invest in a foreign market via FDI
- User asks why a firm should own foreign operations rather than export or license
- User needs to choose between wholly-owned subsidiary, joint venture, or licensing
- User mentions "FDI decision", "OLI", "internationalization mode", or "eclectic theory"

**When NOT to use:**
- For gradual internationalization process -> use grad-uppsala
- For early-stage rapid internationalization -> use grad-born-global
- For national competitive advantage analysis -> use grad-diamond

## Assumptions

```
IRON LAW: ALL Three OLI Advantages Must Be Present to Justify FDI

- Ownership (O) alone -> License or export (no need to be there)
- Ownership + Location (O+L) -> Export (no need to internalize)
- Ownership + Internalization (O+I) -> Domestic production (no location pull)

Only when O + L + I are ALL present does FDI make economic sense.
If ANY one is missing, a different entry mode is optimal.
```

- Firms are rational actors seeking to minimize transaction costs
- Market imperfections (information asymmetry, opportunism) drive internalization
- OLI advantages are firm-specific, industry-specific, and country-specific

## Methodology

### Step 1: Assess Ownership Advantages (O)

Identify firm-specific advantages foreign competitors lack: asset-based (Oa: patents, technology, brand) and transaction-based (Ot: managerial capabilities, scale economies). If no clear O advantage exists, STOP -- the firm has no basis for FDI.

### Step 2: Assess Location Advantages (L)

Evaluate why the foreign location is superior to serving from home:
- **Market-seeking**: Large market size, growing demand, trade barriers making export unviable
- **Resource-seeking**: Low-cost labor, raw materials, specialized talent
- **Efficiency-seeking**: Scale economies, favorable tax regimes, supply chain optimization
- **Strategic asset-seeking**: Access to technology clusters, R&D ecosystems, knowledge networks

If no clear L advantage exists -> Export from home is sufficient.

### Step 3: Assess Internalization Advantages (I)

Evaluate why internal governance is preferable to licensing or franchising:
- **High transaction costs**: Tacit knowledge that is hard to codify and transfer
- **Quality control**: Brand reputation requires tight operational control
- **Opportunism risk**: Licensee may become a competitor or degrade quality
- **Contractual incompleteness**: Cannot write contracts covering all contingencies

If no clear I advantage exists -> License or franchise instead of FDI.

### Step 4: Determine Entry Mode

| OLI Configuration | Recommended Mode |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| O + L + I (all strong) | Wholly-owned subsidiary (greenfield or acquisition) |
| O + L + I (I moderate) | Joint venture (share control, reduce risk) |
| O + L (no I) | Licensing / franchising |
| O only (no L, no I) | Export from home |
| No O | Do not internationalize |

## Output Format

```markdown
# OLI Assessment: {Firm} -> {Target Country/Market}

## Ownership Advantages (O)
- Asset-based: {list with strength rating}
- Transaction-based: {list with strength rating}
- O assessment: Strong / Moderate / Weak

## Location Advantages (L)
- Motivation: Market / Resource / Efficiency / Strategic asset
- Key L factors: {list}
- L assessment: Strong / Moderate / Weak

## Internalization Advantages (I)
- Transaction cost drivers: {list}
- Opportunism risk: High / Medium / Low
- I assessment: Strong / Moderate / Weak

## OLI Configuration: {O+L+I / O+L / O only / etc.}

## Recommended Entry Mode: {mode with rationale}
```

## Gotchas

- **OLI is a static snapshot**: Advantages evolve. A location advantage (cheap labor) may erode. Reassess periodically.
- **O advantages can be imitated**: Patents expire, knowledge diffuses. Sustainable O requires continuous innovation.
- **Government policy changes L overnight**: Tax incentives, trade agreements, or political instability can flip L assessments.
- **JVs are a distinct strategy, not a compromise**: Do not default to JV out of uncertainty. JVs carry their own risks.
- **OLI does not address timing**: It answers "should we FDI?" not "when?" For sequencing, combine with Uppsala.
