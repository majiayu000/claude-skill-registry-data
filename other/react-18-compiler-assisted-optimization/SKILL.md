# Compiler-Assisted Optimization (React 18)

## Summary

Leverage compiler-level optimizations to minimize re-renders and improve scheduling efficiency.

## Key Capabilities

- Identify components eligible for automatic memoization.
- Integrate compiler hints into build pipelines.
- Validate correctness of compiler-optimized output.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Formalize correctness criteria for compiler optimizations.
- Build a validation harness for optimized components.
- Quantify performance gains across representative workloads.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Provide compiler optimization configuration and output examples.
- Demonstrate correctness equivalence with tests.
- Report measured performance improvements.
