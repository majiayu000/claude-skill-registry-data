description: Use when creating ASCII art to guide your artistic approach

When creating ASCII art, use ONLY the characters listed in `(workspace folder)/chars.txt`. This constraint forces cleaner compositions. Read the file first, then work within its limits.

IMPORTANT: Do it once and be done. Your first attempt is fine. Do NOT iterate, refine, or "make it better." Save the file and move on.
