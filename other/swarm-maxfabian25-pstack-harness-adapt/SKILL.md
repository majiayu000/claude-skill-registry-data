# Swarm

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
4. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `~/.config/pstack/models.md`. Resolve and apply it per [harnesses.md](../poteto-mode/references/harnesses.md) (Models), which holds the default and covers `auto`, `inherit-parent`, and a rejected model. For a model race, name each arm's model up front. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message as general-purpose remote cloud workers in the background, per [harnesses.md](../poteto-mode/references/harnesses.md) (Cloud and isolated work), with the step 4 model. Use a local background worker, on its own worktree when it writes, only when the worker needs access to something on the user's computer.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, give it that base. A Codex cloud task takes `--branch <base>`, a manual worktree takes `<base>` in `git worktree add`, and any other worker's brief starts by checking out `origin/<base>`.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
