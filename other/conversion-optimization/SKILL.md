6. VALUE STACK

```

### Headline Frameworks

| Framework | Structure | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| PAS | Problem-Agitate-Solve | Pain-aware audience |
| AIDA | Attention-Interest-Desire-Action | Cold traffic |
| 4U | Urgent-Unique-Useful-Ultra-specific | Competitive markets |
| Bridge | Before-After-Bridge | Transformation offers |

### Story Structure

1. **Hook**: Relatable moment of frustration
2. **Backstory**: Why you understand their pain
3. **Discovery**: How you found the solution
4. **Results**: What happened when you applied it
5. **Method**: The system you created
6. **Offer**: How they can get the same results

## Offer Structure

### Core Offer Components

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Main deliverable | Core transformation | 12-week program |
| Support mechanism | Reduce friction | Weekly Q&A calls |
| Templates/tools | Speed implementation | Swipe files, scripts |
| Community | Accountability + social proof | Private Slack/forum |
| Bonuses | Increase perceived value | Quick-start guide |

### Value Stack Presentation

```
YOU GET:
✓ [Main Product] (Value: $X)
✓ [Bonus 1] (Value: $X)
✓ [Bonus 2] (Value: $X)
✓ [Bonus 3] (Value: $X)

Total Value: $X,XXX
Today's Price: $XXX
```

**Rules:**
- Value anchors should be believable
- Bonuses should solve adjacent problems
- Don't exceed 5-7 items (cognitive overload)

## Pricing Strategy

### Price Point Framework

| Signal | Lower Price | Higher Price |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Audience sophistication | Low | High |
| Implementation support | Low | High |
| Results timeframe | Long | Short |
| Risk level | High | Low (guarantees) |
| Competition | Commodity | Unique |

### Payment Options

| Option | Use When | Conversion Impact |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| One-time | Low price, simple offer | Baseline |
| Payment plan | $500+ offers | +15-30% |
| Subscription | Ongoing value | Lower initial, higher LTV |
| Pay-what-you-want | Community building | Highly variable |

### Anchoring Tactics

1. **Comparison anchor**: "Competitors charge $X"
2. **Value anchor**: "Total value: $X, yours for $Y"
3. **ROI anchor**: "If this gets you just one client..."
4. **Time anchor**: "That's less than $X/day"
5. **Alternative anchor**: "You could hire a consultant for $X..."

## Urgency & Scarcity

### Ethical Mechanisms

| Type | Implementation | Authenticity Check |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Deadline | Cohort start, price increase | Real operational reason |
| Quantity | Limited seats, inventory | Actual capacity constraint |
| Bonus expiration | Fast-action bonus | Genuinely removing it |
| Seasonal | Launch window | Consistent pattern |

### Evergreen Options

- Rolling enrollment with cohort starts
- Price increases based on enrollment count
- Bonus rotation (different bonuses each month)
- Limited-time add-ons

**Anti-pattern:** Fake scarcity destroys trust. Only use what you'll enforce.

## Checkout Optimization

### Page Elements

```
CHECKOUT PAGE:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Order Summary (what they get)   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Price + Payment Options         │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ □ Order Bump ($XX value)        │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Contact Information             │
│ Payment Information             │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Trust Badges + Guarantee        │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Complete Purchase]             │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Trust Indicators

- Security badges (SSL, payment processor logos)
- Money-back guarantee badge
- Testimonial snippet
- Support contact info
- Privacy policy link

### Order Bump Strategy

| Criteria | Good Order Bump |
|----------|-----------------|
| Price | 20-40% of main offer |
| Relevance | Enhances main purchase |
| Effort | Zero extra work for you |
| Decision | Impulse-friendly |

**Expected conversion:** 15-30% take rate

### Abandonment Reduction

1. **Exit intent popup**: Discount or deadline reminder
2. **Email sequence**: Cart abandonment (3 emails over 3 days)
3. **Retargeting**: Social/display ads to abandoners
4. **Live chat**: Answer questions in real-time
5. **Simplify**: Reduce form fields, add guest checkout
