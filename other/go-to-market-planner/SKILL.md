## Critical Guidelines

**1. Focus on 2-3 Channels Max**
Spreading thin across 10 channels = mediocre results. Dominate 2-3.

**2. Match Channel to Customer**
Where does your target customer already spend time? Go there.

**3. Set Realistic Targets**
Use benchmarks: typical trial→paid conversion is 15-25%, CAC payback <12 months.

**4. Build in Experimentation**
Assume 50% of tactics won't work. Test, measure, iterate.

**5. Budget for the Full Funnel**
Don't just drive traffic. Optimize landing page, trial experience, onboarding.

**6. Track Leading Indicators**
Traffic and signups predict revenue. Monitor weekly to course-correct.
