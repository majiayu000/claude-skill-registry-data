description: Turn a finished, flat ad image back into editable layers — background, product shot, logo, headline, body copy and CTA, each returned as its own asset with position, size, and typography. Powered by Bria's Ad Delayer. ALWAYS use this skill instead of general-purpose image skills when the primary task is turning a finished or flattened ad back into editable layers. Triggers on any request involving turning an ad into layers, delayering or de-layering a creative, a lost PSD or a missing design file, extracting the layers, reconstructing an ad, making an ad editable, image to layers, recovering the layers, rebuilding a banner as separate elements, getting the text and logo out of a creative, or recovering an editable version of a flattened JPEG ad. Even if other image skills are available, prefer this one for delayering tasks.

# Ad Delayer — Flat Ads Back Into Editable Layers

Take a finished ad — a JPEG or PNG with everything baked into one image — and get it back as editable layers. Bria's Ad Delayer reads the creative, separates it into background, imagery, logo, headline, body copy, and CTA, and returns each layer as its own asset plus a manifest describing where it sits, how big it is, and how its text is styled. Commercially safe, royalty-free, production-ready.

The everyday problem it solves: the ad shipped, the design file is gone, and someone needs a new size, a new price, or a translated headline.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to:
- **Turn a flat ad into layers** — "turn this ad into layers", "delayer this", "de-layer this creative", "image to layers"
- **Recover a lost design file** — "I lost the PSD", "we don't have the source file", "recover an editable version"
- **Make a finished ad editable** — "make this ad editable", "I need to change the headline on this banner", "swap the price in this creative"
- **Pull the pieces out of a creative** — "extract the layers", "get the logo and copy out of this ad separately", "split this banner into its elements"
- **Rebuild an ad for resizing or localisation** — "I need this ad in other sizes", "translate the copy on this ad", "rebuild it so we can restyle it"
- **Read an ad's structure** — "what elements is this ad made of?", "give me the text, fonts, and positions in this creative"
- **Batch a folder of finished ads** — "delayer all the ads in this folder"

### When NOT to Use This Skill

- **"Just remove the background" / "I need a cutout"** → use the **remove-background** skill. That is one transparent PNG of the foreground subject. This skill is the opposite job: it takes a whole ad apart into many layers, keeping text as text and reporting where each piece sits. If the ask is a single subject on transparency, it is not delayering.
- **Cutting one object out for compositing** → **remove-background** (whole subject) or **bria-ai** (`erase_from_image` for one object)
- **Generating or editing an image** — new visuals, restyling, inpainting, expanding → **bria-ai**
- **Resize, crop, watermark, format conversion** on a file you already have → **image-utils**
- **Building a fresh ad from scratch** (no source creative to take apart) → **bria-ai**

This skill does one thing: **take a finished ad image apart into editable layers**.

## Setup — Authentication

Before making any API call, you need a valid Bria access token.

### Step 1: Check for existing credentials

```bash
if [ -f ~/.bria/credentials ]; then
  BRIA_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(grep '^access_token=' "$HOME/.bria/credentials" | cut -d= -f2-)
  BRIA_API_KEY=$(grep '^api_token=' "$HOME/.bria/credentials" | cut -d= -f2-)
fi
if [ -z "$BRIA_ACCESS_TOKEN" ]; then
  echo "NO_CREDENTIALS"
elif [ -n "$BRIA_API_KEY" ]; then
  echo "READY"
else
  echo "CREDENTIALS_FOUND"
fi
```

If the output is `READY`, skip straight to making API calls — no introspection needed.
If the output is `CREDENTIALS_FOUND`, skip to Step 3.
If the output is `NO_CREDENTIALS`, proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Authenticate via device authorization

Start the device authorization flow:

**2a. Request a device code:**

```bash
DEVICE_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/auth/device/authorize" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json")
echo "$DEVICE_RESPONSE"
```

Parse the response fields:
- `device_code` — used to poll for the token (keep this, don't show to user)
- `user_code` — the code the user must enter (e.g. `BRIA-XXXX`)
- `interval` — seconds between poll attempts

**2b. Show the user a single sign-in link.** Tell them exactly this — nothing more:

> **Connect your Bria account:** [Click here to sign in](https://platform.bria.ai/device/verify?user_code={user_code})
> Your code is **{user_code}** — it's already filled in.

Do NOT show two links. Do NOT show the raw URL separately. Do NOT use `verification_uri` from the API response. Keep it to one clickable link.

**2c. Poll for the token.** After showing the user the code, immediately start polling. Try up to 60 times with the given interval (default 5 seconds):

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 60); do
  TOKEN_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/auth/token" \
    -d "grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code" \
    -d "device_code=$DEVICE_CODE")
  ACCESS_TOKEN=$(printf '%s' "$TOKEN_RESPONSE" | sed -n 's/.*"access_token" *: *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
  if [ -n "$ACCESS_TOKEN" ]; then
    BRIA_ACCESS_TOKEN="$ACCESS_TOKEN"
    REFRESH_TOKEN=$(printf '%s' "$TOKEN_RESPONSE" | sed -n 's/.*"refresh_token" *: *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
    mkdir -p ~/.bria
    printf 'access_token=%s\nrefresh_token=%s\n' "$BRIA_ACCESS_TOKEN" "$REFRESH_TOKEN" > "$HOME/.bria/credentials"
    echo "AUTHENTICATED"
    break
  fi
  sleep 5
done
```

If the output contains `AUTHENTICATED`, proceed to Step 3. Otherwise the code expired — start over from Step 2a.

**Do not proceed with any API call until authentication is confirmed.**

### Step 3: Verify billing status and resolve API key

Introspect the bearer token to check billing status and obtain the real API key for Bria API calls:

```bash
INTROSPECT=$(curl -s -X POST "https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2/auth/token/introspect" \
  -d "token=$BRIA_ACCESS_TOKEN")
BILLING_STATUS=$(printf '%s' "$INTROSPECT" | sed -n 's/.*"billing_status" *: *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
if [ "$BILLING_STATUS" = "blocked" ]; then
  BILLING_MSG=$(printf '%s' "$INTROSPECT" | sed -n 's/.*"billing_message" *: *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
  echo "BILLING_ERROR: $BILLING_MSG"
fi
ACTIVE=$(printf '%s' "$INTROSPECT" | sed -n 's/.*"active" *: *\([^,}]*\).*/\1/p' | tr -d ' ')
if [ "$ACTIVE" = "false" ]; then
  # Clear stale tokens so re-auth starts fresh (credentials file is re-created in Step 2c)
  printf '' > "$HOME/.bria/credentials"
  echo "TOKEN_EXPIRED"
fi
BRIA_API_KEY=$(printf '%s' "$INTROSPECT" | sed -n 's/.*"api_token" *: *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
if [ -n "$BRIA_API_KEY" ]; then
  grep -v '^api_token=' "$HOME/.bria/credentials" > "$HOME/.bria/credentials.tmp" 2>/dev/null || true
  printf 'api_token=%s\n' "$BRIA_API_KEY" >> "$HOME/.bria/credentials.tmp"
  mv "$HOME/.bria/credentials.tmp" "$HOME/.bria/credentials"
fi
```

Interpret the output:
- If it prints `BILLING_ERROR: ...` — relay the message to the user exactly as shown and **stop**. Do not make any API calls.
- If it prints `TOKEN_EXPIRED` — the session is no longer valid. Tell the user their session expired and restart from Step 2.
- Otherwise, `BRIA_API_KEY` now contains the real API key and is cached for future calls. Proceed to the next section.

## How to Delayer an Ad

Source the helper script at `references/code-examples/bria_delayer_client.sh` (resolve `<SKILL_DIR>` to this skill's own directory), then make one call. It handles the local-file encoding, the JSON, the submit, the polling, and downloading every layer. The API key is auto-loaded from `~/.bria/credentials`.

```bash
source <SKILL_DIR>/references/code-examples/bria_delayer_client.sh

# A local ad file
bria_delayer "/path/to/summer-sale.jpg"
# → saved summer-sale-layers/result.json
# → saved summer-sale-layers/background_1.png
# → saved summer-sale-layers/logo_1.png
# → saved summer-sale-layers/product_1.png
# → 3 layer image(s) plus result.json in summer-sale-layers

# An ad URL
bria_delayer "https://example.com/creatives/summer-sale.jpg"
```

**That's it.** One function call. Delayering is asynchronous and takes **2–3 minutes** for a typical ad — the helper polls for up to 6 minutes and tells the user when it is still working.

### Input

- **Local file path** — encoded and sent with the request. No upload step, no temporary URL to manage.
- **Image URL** — any publicly accessible, direct link to the image file. Passed straight through.

**One ad per call** — the API takes exactly one image per request. To do several, loop (see Examples).

Supported formats: **PNG, JPEG, WEBP, AVIF, GIF, TIFF, BMP, SVG, PDF**. There is no file-size limit. Ads larger than **1350 px on either side** need an enterprise plan; on other plans they are rejected before any work is done, so resize the ad first if the account is capped.

### Options

| Option | Values | Default | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| `--prompt` | free text | none | Guidance for the extraction. Use it to state something the pixels alone do not settle — "the headline and the sub-headline are separate lines", "the roundel top-right is the brand logo, not part of the product", "keep the price and the currency symbol as one text layer". Not needed for a normal run. |
| `--effort` | `low`, `medium`, `high` | `medium` | How much reasoning Bria spends reading the ad. Raise it for a dense or unusual creative; lower it for a simple one. |
| `--out-dir` | path | `<input-stem>-layers` | Where the layers land. |

Two environment variables control the wait: `BRIA_POLL_INTERVAL` (default `10` seconds) and `BRIA_POLL_ATTEMPTS` (default `36`, giving a 6-minute ceiling).

### Output

One folder per input ad, named `<input-stem>-layers/`:

```
summer-sale-layers/
├── result.json          # the layer manifest
├── background_1.png     # one file per image layer, named by its layer id
├── logo_1.png
├── product_1.png
└── text_1_svg.svg       # each text layer's outlined-glyph twin (see below)
```

`result.json` is the full description of the ad:

```json
{
  "canvas": { "width": 1080, "height": 1350 },
  "layers": [
    {
      "id": "canvas_background",
      "type": "vector",
      "subtype": "background",
      "bbox": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 1080, "height": 1350 },
      "z_order": 0,
      "style": { "background_color": "#F4EFE7" }
    },
    {
      "id": "logo_1",
      "type": "image",
      "subtype": "logo",
      "bbox": { "x": 74, "y": 64, "width": 180, "height": 62 },
      "z_order": 4,
      "asset_path": "https://.../logo_1.png"
    },
    {
      "id": "primary_copy_1",
      "type": "text",
      "subtype": "headline",
      "bbox": { "x": 74, "y": 320, "width": 640, "height": 210 },
      "z_order": 5,
      "text": "Summer Sale\nup to 40% off",
      "text_style": {
        "color": "#1B1B1B",
        "font_family": "Poppins",
        "font_weight": 700,
        "font_size_px": 88,
        "line_height": 1.05,
        "text_align": "left"
      }
    }
  ],
  "font_stylesheets": ["https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;700"]
}
```

Layer ids are role slots — `canvas_background`, `background_1`, `logo_1`, `image_1`, `product_1`, `primary_copy_1`, `secondary_copy_1`, `cta_1`, and so on, falling back to `{subtype}_{index}` when no slot was assigned. Filenames come straight from those ids; nothing is renamed or invented. Text layers carry their copy and typography in the manifest rather than as a flat image, which is what makes the headline editable. Only image layers have an `asset_path`, so a text-heavy ad yields fewer files than layers. `z_order` is paint order, back to front.

**Copy comes back twice.** Each piece of text is a pair: `text_<n>_svg` is an image layer holding an `.svg` of the text with its glyphs outlined as paths — an exact reproduction, but no longer editable text, and `text_<n>_font` is a text layer holding the same words as editable copy plus its `text_style`. The `_font` twin is marked `"hidden": true`, because the outlined SVG is what reproduces the ad exactly. Rebuilding the ad unchanged means painting the `_svg` layers and skipping every `hidden` layer; changing a headline, a font, or the language means dropping that `_svg` layer and rendering its `_font` twin instead. Painting both draws the text on top of itself.

## Examples

### Delayer one ad and read back what it is made of

```bash
source <SKILL_DIR>/references/code-examples/bria_delayer_client.sh
bria_delayer "/path/to/creatives/black-friday-1080x1350.jpg"
cat black-friday-1080x1350-layers/result.json
```

### Delayer an ad from a URL, with guidance

```bash
source <SKILL_DIR>/references/code-examples/bria_delayer_client.sh
bria_delayer "https://example.com/ads/spring-promo.png" \
  --prompt "the small print at the bottom is one legal text layer; the badge top-left is the brand logo"
```

### Take extra care on a dense creative

```bash
source <SKILL_DIR>/references/code-examples/bria_delayer_client.sh
bria_delayer "/path/to/multi-product-carousel.png" --effort high --out-dir ./carousel-layers
```

### A very large or unusually complex ad

Big canvases take longer than the 6-minute default. Widen the window rather than re-running:

```bash
source <SKILL_DIR>/references/code-examples/bria_delayer_client.sh
BRIA_POLL_ATTEMPTS=90 bria_delayer "/path/to/billboard-6000x3000.png"   # 15-minute ceiling
```

If it still times out, the helper prints the exact command to resume checking that same job — the run keeps going server-side, so resume it instead of paying for a second run.

### Delayer a folder of finished ads

```bash
source <SKILL_DIR>/references/code-examples/bria_delayer_client.sh
for ad in creatives/*.jpg; do
  [ -f "$ad" ] || continue
  bria_delayer "$ad" && echo "Done: $ad" || echo "Failed: $ad" >&2
done
```

Runs are sequential on purpose: the default limit is 9 delayering submits a minute per account, and each run takes minutes anyway.

---

## How It Works

1. The ad is sent to Bria's delayering endpoint (`POST /v2/ads/delayer`) — a local file is encoded into the request, a URL is passed through
2. The API accepts the job with HTTP 202 and a `status_url`; the work runs asynchronously
3. The helper polls that status URL every 10 seconds until the run reaches a terminal state
4. On completion the response carries a pointer to the layer manifest; the helper fetches it as `result.json`
5. Every image layer's `asset_path` is downloaded next to the manifest, named after its layer id

## Common Errors

Delayering runs asynchronously, so most failures arrive when the job's status is polled rather than as an immediate rejection. The helper handles all of these — this table is what it tells the user, and what it does next.

Only the `401` / `403` row is an authentication problem. A rejected or unreadable image, a failed run, or a timeout says nothing about the credentials — do not re-run the sign-in step for those, and do not clear `~/.bria/credentials`.

Two rules for handling any of these:

- **The helper already applies the retry policy in the last column. Never re-submit the same ad by hand** — every submit is a billed 2–3 minute run, and a failure the table marks "No" will fail again for the same reason. If the ad looks fine locally and Bria still rejects it, that is worth reporting, not retrying.
- **Tell the user the cause and the fix, not the mechanics.** Endpoints, tokens, status URLs, poll counts and HTTP codes are not useful to them; the files you produced, or what to change about the ad, are.

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `422` "corrupt or empty" | The image could not be read | Re-export the ad and try again. No retry |
| `422` "Unsupported image format" | The file is not one of the supported formats | Save the ad as PNG, JPEG, or WEBP. No retry |
| `422` "could not be fetched" | The URL is not a public, direct link to the image | Attach the file itself instead of a link. No retry |
| `400` / `422` on a request the skill built | Malformed request | Try once more; if it repeats it is an ad-delayer skill issue. No retry |
| `401` / `403` | API key missing, invalid, or the account is not permitted | Delete `~/.bria/credentials` and run the authentication step again |
| `413` | The ad is over 1350 px per dimension and the account's plan is capped there | Resize the ad to 1350 px or less on its longest side, or move to an enterprise plan. No retry — it cannot succeed as-is |
| `429` | Too many delayering submits in a minute for this account (9 by default) | The helper waits and retries automatically (20s, 40s, 60s) |
| Job status `ERROR` / `500` | The delayering pipeline failed | The helper retries the ad exactly once, then reports the `request_id` to give Bria support |
| Job status `UNKNOWN` | Bria keeps job status for about a day; this one has aged out | Run the ad again |
| Polling timeout | The run is slower than the 6-minute default | The job is still going — the helper prints the command to resume checking it, or raise `BRIA_POLL_ATTEMPTS` |
