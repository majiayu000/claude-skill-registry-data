# AIsa Web Search

Search the web using the AIsa Scholar Web Search endpoint. Returns structured results with titles, URLs, and content snippets.

## Setup

This skill requires the `AISA_API_KEY` environment variable. When installed as a Claude plugin, the key is configured via the environment variables.

## Usage

Run the search client with the `web` subcommand:

```bash
python3 scripts/search_client.py web --query "<search query>" --count <max_results>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--query` / `-q` | Yes | — | The search query string |
| `--count` / `-c` | No | 10 | Maximum number of results (1–100) |

### Example

```bash
python3 scripts/search_client.py web --query "latest AI agent frameworks 2026" --count 5
```

## Output

The script prints structured results including:
- **Title** — Page title
- **URL** — Direct link to the source
- **Snippet** — Content excerpt relevant to the query

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to search the web, find information online, look up recent events, or needs general web results. This is the most versatile search tool for broad queries.
