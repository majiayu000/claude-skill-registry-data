# Design System Token Architecture

## Summary
Architect scalable design token propagation using React Context and CSS-in-JS/Variables.

## Key Capabilities
- Define semantic token layers (Primitive vs. Component).
- Implement dynamic theming with runtime token switching.
- Optimization re-renders when swapping global themes.

## PhD-Level Challenges
- Manage type-safety for deeply nested token schemas.
- Analyze the performance cost of CSS generation at runtime.
- Synchronize token updates across micro-frontends.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Demonstrate a multi-theme switching capability.
- Provide a token schema definition file.
- Benchmark theme switch render cost.
