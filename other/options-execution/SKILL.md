## Defaults

| Parameter | Default Value | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| min_days_to_expiry | 45 | Buying strategies need time for thesis to develop |
| max_days_to_expiry_sell | 45 | Selling strategies capture theta decay in 30-45 day window |
| exit_dte_threshold | 21 | Exit or roll buying strategies before 21 DTE to avoid gamma risk |
| bid_ask_max_spread | 5% | Illiquid options destroy edge through wide spreads |
| max_position_risk | 2% | Maximum capital risk per single options trade |

## Preflight

Run canonical pre-flight per `contracts/preflight.md`. Include the `X-Agentii-Trace` header on every tool call per `contracts/x-agentii-trace-header.md` — carry the `_run_id` from your first tool result and name yourself (and your parent, if you were spawned).

## Data Source Priority

1. Options execution framework — `references/options-strategies.md` (bundled strategy reference)
2. Upstream context — market structure from `price-action` + pattern identification from `chart-patterns`
3. Options setups — `search_technical_setups(instrument_scope=["option"], ...)` for matching against `gold.technical_setups`

## Methodology

### Retrieval Scope
structured_only

### Retrieval Strategy
This skill follows Branch (d) Simple Lookup from `contracts/retrieval.md`: the strategy framework is bundled in `references/options-strategies.md`. Real-time data via `get_realtime_quote`. Matched options setups via `search_technical_setups(instrument_scope=["option"])`. No unstructured document retrieval.

### Temporal Scope
See frontmatter temporal_scope block.

### Tool Allowlist
See frontmatter allowed_tools.

### Protocol

This skill implements a professional options execution framework. Options are treated as execution tools for expressing directional or volatility views with defined risk — not as standalone gambling instruments. The framework applies three mandatory filters (liquidity, cost, volatility) before any strategy selection. Detailed strategy definitions, the strategy→market condition matrix, and execution rules are in `references/options-strategies.md`.

#### Step 1 — Macro and Volatility Context

1. Assess broad market volatility via VIX or equivalent from `get_realtime_quote`.
2. Classify IV environment: High IV (> 70th percentile) → favor premium-selling strategies. Low IV (< 30th percentile) → favor premium-buying strategies. Mid-range → balanced.
3. Macro regime from upstream analysis: expansion favors longs, contraction favors shorts; high uncertainty favors straddle/strangle.

#### Step 2 — Directional Thesis Input

1. Receive Always In direction from `price-action` skill.
2. Receive primary pattern and confidence level from `chart-patterns` skill.
3. If no upstream context: derive from raw price data and fundamental thesis.
4. Classify thesis: Bullish / Bearish / Neutral / Direction-uncertain-large-move-expected.

#### Step 3 — Strategy Selection

Apply the strategy matrix to select the appropriate options structure:

1. **Apply filters**: Check liquidity (bid-ask spread), cost (premium vs position), IV environment.
2. **Map thesis to strategy**: Use the strategy→condition matrix in `references/options-strategies.md`.
3. **Query pipeline setups**: `search_technical_setups(instrument_scope=["option"], pattern_type=<derived>)` for matching strategy setups from `gold.technical_setups`.
4. **Load full setup**: `get_technical_setup(setup_id=<best_match>)` for exact parameters.
5. **Fallback**: Use manual strategy rules from the reference.

#### Step 4 — Execution Plan

1. **Strike selection**: OTM for directional (delta 0.40-0.60), ATM for straddles, OTM for strangles.
2. **Expiry selection**: 45-60 DTE for buying strategies, 30-45 DTE for selling strategies.
3. **Position sizing**: Risk/contract ≤ 2% of capital. For selling strategies, size on notional exposure.
4. **Exit plan**: Profit target, time stop (21 DTE for buys), stop loss level.
5. **Invalidation**: Conditions that void the trade (thesis break, IV regime change, liquidity deterioration).

#### Step 5 — Trade Plan Output

1. **Strategy**: Selected options strategy with justification from the matrix.
2. **Contract Specs**: Strike(s), expiry, type (call/put), net debit/credit.
3. **Risk**: Maximum loss in dollars and percentage of capital.
4. **Reward**: Target profit, probability of profit (if calculable).
5. **Breakeven**: Exact breakeven price(s) at expiration.
6. **Management Plan**: Roll/adjust/exit conditions.
7. **Setup Match**: If from `gold.technical_setups`, include setup_id and research_score.

## Output File

`{ticker}/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_options-execution_{affix}.md`

## Output Structure

1. **Executive Summary** — Selected strategy, market conditions, thesis alignment, key contract specs
2. **Volatility Context** — IV percentile, IV environment classification, implications for strategy selection
3. **Directional Thesis** — Price-action derived view, pattern context, confidence level
4. **Filter Results** — Liquidity check (bid-ask), cost assessment, IV filter outcome
5. **Strategy Selection** — Strategy matrix match, pipeline setup match (if any), justification
6. **Contract Specifications** — Exact strikes, expiry, premiums, net debit/credit
7. **Risk and Reward** — Max loss, max profit, breakeven(s), probability assessment
8. **Management Plan** — Entry timing, profit targets, time stop, adjustment triggers
9. **Coverage Gaps** — Data limitations, manual vs pipeline-derived parameters

## Error Handling

| Error | Fallback |
|-------|----------|
| No matching options setup from MCP | Use manual strategy rules from references/options-strategies.md; flag coverage_gap |
| IV data unavailable | Assume mid-range IV; flag as degraded |
| Bid-ask wider than 5% | Flag as low-liquidity; suggest alternative strikes or skip |
| No directional thesis from upstream | Derive from raw price data; flag as independently determined |
| `search_technical_setups` unreachable | Use full manual strategy matrix; flag all parameters |
