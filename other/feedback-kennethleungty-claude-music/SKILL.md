This skill is part of the claude-music plugin. Only invoke when the user explicitly uses the slash command.

# Feedback

Open the GitHub issues page so the user can share feedback or report a bug.

## Instructions

1. Run this command to open the browser:

```bash
xdg-open "https://github.com/kennethleungty/claude-music/issues/new" 2>/dev/null || open "https://github.com/kennethleungty/claude-music/issues/new" 2>/dev/null
```

2. Tell the user:

> Opening GitHub Issues — thanks for taking the time to share feedback!
