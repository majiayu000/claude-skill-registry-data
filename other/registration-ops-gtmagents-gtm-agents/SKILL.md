# Registration & Automation Ops Skill

## When to Use
- Setting up a new webinar form or integration.
- Troubleshooting registration/attendance data syncing to MAP/CRM.
- Designing reminder/nurture cadences linked to webinar engagement.

## Framework
1. **Form Design** – required vs optional fields, consent language, dynamic questions.
2. **Routing & Scoring** – assign program statuses, lead scores, account ownership.
3. **Automation** – confirmation emails, reminder cadence, SMS/push (if used), calendar holds.
4. **Integrations** – API/connector setup (Zoom + HubSpot, ON24 + Marketo, etc.), field mapping.
5. **Data Hygiene** – dedupe, UTM tracking, fallback entries for manual registrants.

## Templates
- Field mapping matrix (platform → MAP/CRM).
- Reminder schedule (T-7, T-1, T-0, post-event).
- QA checklist for test registrations and sync validation.

## Tips
- Always include add-to-calendar links and ICS files.
- Capture consent per region; respect language/localization needs.
- Maintain a registration SLA to ensure sales gets live notifications for VIP sign-ups.
