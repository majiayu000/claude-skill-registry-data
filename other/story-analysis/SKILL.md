---

### SA5: Scene Structure

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. The Checklist Tyranny
**Pattern:** Treating all checklist items as equally important. Flagging every missed item as a problem requiring fix.
**Why it fails:** Not all issues matter equally. A missing shattering moment is critical; a slight POV wobble might be stylistic choice. Checklists identify possibilities, not mandates.
**Fix:** Prioritize by impact. Ask "Does this actually hurt the story?" before recommending changes. Some rules can be broken effectively.

### 2. The Genre Blindness
**Pattern:** Applying one genre's standards to all stories. Evaluating literary fiction by thriller pacing standards, or action stories by literary depth requirements.
**Why it fails:** Genres have different contracts with readers. What's a flaw in one genre is a feature in another.
**Fix:** Identify genre expectations first. Evaluate against what the story is trying to be, not a universal standard.

### 3. The Nitpick Cascade
**Pattern:** Focusing on micro-issues while missing macro problems. Catching comma splices while the story has no conflict.
**Why it fails:** Sentence-level perfection can't save structural failure. Fixing small things first is procrastination from hard work.
**Fix:** Diagnose at structure level first. Only move to prose-level analysis after structure is sound.

### 4. The Comparison Trap
**Pattern:** Evaluating against published bestsellers or classics. "This isn't as good as [famous work]."
**Why it fails:** Drafts aren't finished works. Different stories serve different purposes. Unfair comparison discourages rather than guides.
**Fix:** Evaluate against the story's own goals. What is this trying to do? Does it succeed at that?

### 5. The Fix-Everything Dump
**Pattern:** Delivering a comprehensive list of all issues without prioritization or encouragement.
**Why it fails:** Overwhelming. Writers shut down when facing 50 problems. No sense of what matters most.
**Fix:** Identify 3-5 highest-impact issues. Note what's working. Create actionable, prioritized guidance.
