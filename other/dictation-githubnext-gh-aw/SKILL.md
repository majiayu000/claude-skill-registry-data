# Dictation Instructions

## Technical Context

GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw) is a CLI tool for writing agentic workflows in natural language using markdown files and running them as GitHub Actions. When fixing dictated text, use these project-specific terms and conventions.

## Fix Speech-to-Text Errors

Common speech-to-text misrecognitions and their corrections:

### Safe Outputs/Inputs
- "safe output" → safe-output
- "safe outputs" → safe-outputs
- "safe input" → safe-input
- "safe inputs" → safe-inputs
- "save outputs" → safe-outputs
- "save output" → safe-output

### Workflow Terms
- "agent ic workflows" → agentic workflows
- "agent tick workflows" → agentic workflows
- "work flow" → workflow
- "work flows" → workflows
- "G H A W" → gh-aw
- "G age A W" → gh-aw

### Configuration
- "front matter" → frontmatter
- "tool set" → toolset
- "tool sets" → toolsets
- "M C P servers" → MCP servers
- "M C P server" → MCP server
- "lock file" → lockfile

### Commands & Operations
- "re compile" → recompile
- "runs on" → runs-on
- "time out minutes" → timeout-minutes
- "work flow dispatch" → workflow-dispatch
- "pull request" → pull-request (in YAML contexts)

### GitHub Actions
- "add comment" → add-comment
- "add labels" → add-labels
- "close issue" → close-issue
- "create issue" → create-issue
- "pull request review" → pull-request-review

### AI Engines
- "co-pilot" → copilot
- "Co-Pilot" → Copilot
- "code X" → codex
- "Code X" → Codex

### Spacing/Hyphenation Ambiguity
When context suggests a GitHub Actions key or CLI flag:
- Use hyphens: `timeout-minutes`, `runs-on`, `cache-memory`
- In YAML: prefer hyphenated form
- In prose: either form acceptable, prefer hyphenated for consistency

## Guidelines

You do not have enough background information to plan or provide code examples.
- Do NOT generate code examples
- Do NOT plan steps or provide implementation guidance
- Focus ONLY on fixing speech-to-text errors (misrecognized words, spacing, hyphenation)
- When unsure, prefer the hyphenated form for technical terms
- Preserve the user's intended meaning while correcting transcription errors
