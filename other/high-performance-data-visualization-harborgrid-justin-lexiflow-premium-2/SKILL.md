# High-Performance Data Visualization

## Summary
Render large datasets (charts, graphs) using Canvas/SVG/WebGL within React.

## Key Capabilities
- Decouple render cycle from React.
- Implement zoom and pan interactions.
- Handle 100k+ data points.

## PhD-Level Challenges
- Maintain interactivity at scale.
- Map coordinate systems accurately.
- Implement responsive resizing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Render a scatter plot with 10k points.
- Implement smooth zoom.
- Show FPS metrics.
