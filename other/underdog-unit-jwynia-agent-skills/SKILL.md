# Underdog Unit: Narrative Formula Skill

You help writers create stories using the "Underdog Unit" formula: institutional outcasts given impossible mandates with minimal resources, creating pressure cookers for character development and creative problem-solving.

## Core Formula

**Outcasts + Impossible Mandate + Severe Constraints = Narrative Tension**

The power lies in:
- Forcing creative solutions through limitation
- Building team bonds through shared adversity
- Creating David vs. Goliath dynamics within institutions

## The Four Core Elements

### 1. The Mandate (Mission Type)

| Mandate Type | Enemy | Examples |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Cold Cases | Time | Old evidence, faded memories, dead witnesses |
| Impossible/Unsolvable | Complexity | Cases that stumped the best |
| Cross-Jurisdictional | Bureaucracy | Navigating multiple systems |
| Internal Affairs | Institution | Investigating their own |
| Experimental/New Threats | The Unknown | Cyber, biotech, emerging crimes |
| PR Disasters | Perception | High-profile failures |
| Political Hot Potatoes | Politics | Cases no one wants |
| Reject Pile | Apathy | Cases deemed unimportant |

### 2. The Constraints (Resource Limitations)

**Physical Space**: Basement storage, abandoned wings, trailers, repurposed areas

**Budget**: Shoestring, self-funded, borrowed, scavenged, barter economy

**Personnel**: Skeleton crew, part-time, borrowed, probationary, volunteers

**Authority**: Limited jurisdiction, advisory only, unofficial, no arrest powers

**Time**: Sunset clause, probationary period, case-by-case renewal

**Technology**: Outdated, no database access, analog only, DIY solutions

**Political**: No leadership support, active sabotage, scapegoat status

### 3. The Team Composition (Outcast Archetypes)

| Archetype | Description | Story Function |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| The Disgraced Expert | Former star with catastrophic failure | Seeking redemption |
| The Rule-Breaker | Gets results through unorthodox methods | Values justice over procedure |
| The Burnout | Lost faith in the system | Rediscovers purpose |
| The Rookie | Inexperienced but eager | Fresh perspective, hasn't learned "impossible" |
| The Outsider | Civilian/reformed criminal/foreign expert | Outside knowledge |
| The Has-Been | Past glory, current irrelevance | Institutional memory |
| The Whistleblower | Did the right thing at wrong time | Principled but isolated |
| The Misfit | Doesn't fit institutional culture | Competent but "difficult" |

### 4. The Institutional Dynamics

| Leadership Type | Relationship to Unit |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Hostile | Wants them to fail, actively undermines |
| Indifferent | Forgot they exist, benign neglect |
| Protective | One champion shields from bureaucracy |
| Conditional | Support contingent on results |
| Divided | Competing agendas, mixed messages |

## Team Formation Patterns

- **Assigned**: No choice, stuck with each other
- **Recruited**: Leader hand-picks for skills
- **Volunteered**: Self-selected from desperation or belief
- **Sentenced**: Alternative to worse fate
- **Inherited**: Previous iteration's leftovers
- **Accidental**: Thrown together by circumstance

## Formula Variations

### The Redemption Arc
- **Elements**: Disgraced professionals + impossible cases + hostile institution
- **Theme**: Personal redemption parallels unit validation
- **Climax**: Often sacrificial victory

### The Innovation Lab
- **Elements**: Misfits + experimental mandate + indifferent institution
- **Theme**: Innovation from the margins
- **Climax**: Breakthrough validates unconventional methods

### The Last Chance Saloon
- **Elements**: Burnouts + cold cases + sunset clause
- **Theme**: Finding purpose before it's too late
- **Climax**: Each victory extends lifeline

### The Expendables
- **Elements**: Rule-breakers + dangerous cases + deniable operations
- **Theme**: Sacrificial service
- **Climax**: Success at personal cost

### The Island of Misfit Toys
- **Elements**: Misfits + reject cases + forgotten corner
- **Theme**: Finding belonging in exile
- **Climax**: Creating value from what others discarded

## Systemic Tensions to Explore

### Resource Creativity
- Constraints force innovation
- Informal networks vs. official channels
- Personal investment compensating for support
- Favor economy

### Loyalty Dynamics
- Team loyalty vs. institutional loyalty
- When to break rules for results
- Covering for each other's weaknesses
- Us vs. them mentality

### Success Paradoxes
- Success attracts unwanted attention
- Success threatens established departments
- Success raises expectations without raising resources
- Success makes them targets

### Identity Questions
- Professional identity vs. institutional rejection
- Finding purpose in the margins
- Building culture without support
- Defining success on own terms

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Choose Core Conflict
What enemy drives your narrative?
- Time (cold cases)
- Complexity (impossible cases)
- Bureaucracy (jurisdictional)
- Institution itself (corruption)
- Unknown (emerging threats)

### Step 2: Layer Constraints
Pick 3-4 for maximum friction:
- One physical (space/equipment)
- One resource (budget/personnel)
- One authority (power/jurisdiction)
- One relationship (institutional dynamics)

### Step 3: Assemble Outcasts
Build complementary dysfunctions:
- Mix experience levels
- Mix failure types
- Mix backgrounds (insider/outsider)
- Create interpersonal friction points

### Step 4: Design Success Conditions
Define victory:
- Short-term wins vs. long-term survival
- Individual redemption vs. unit validation
- System change vs. working within it
- Public victory vs. private knowledge

### Step 5: Build Escalation
Plan increasing pressures:
- Skepticism → active opposition
- Small wins → bigger challenges
- Team friction → cohesion → new conflicts
- Scarcity → solutions → new limitations

## Stakes Escalation Pattern

**Personal** → **Professional** → **Community** → **Systemic**

1. Job at risk, reputation threatened
2. Industry/organization threatened
3. Neighbors, family, local area impacted
4. Entire social/political order at stake

## Unit Naming Conventions

**Official Designations**:
- Unfortunate acronyms (S.C.U.M., F.A.I.L.)
- Bureaucratic blandness (Special Projects Division)
- Basement designations (Unit B-12)
- Numbers instead of names (Unit 13, Division X)

**Unofficial Names**:
- Sardonic nicknames from other departments
- Self-deprecating team adoptions
- Gallows humor references

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too many constraints | Believability breaks if literally everything is against them |
| Unearned competence | Team needs to struggle before succeeding |
| Deus ex machina resources | Solutions should come from established elements |
| Perfect team harmony | Internal conflict drives development |
| Institutional conversion | System rarely admits it was wrong |
| Consequence-free rule breaking | Actions should have prices |

## Quick-Start Templates

### Template 1: The Innocent Professional
- **Pattern**: Competence Trap
- **Team**: Translator + support staff
- **Revelation**: Translating coded criminal communications
- **Conflict**: Criminals, law enforcement, victims all need them

### Template 2: The Desperate Survivor
- **Pattern**: Weakness Lever
- **Team**: Night shift cleaners
- **Revelation**: Cleaning up disguised crime scenes
- **Conflict**: Blackmail, police pressure, moral obligation

### Template 3: The Reluctant Heir
- **Pattern**: Inherited Network
- **Team**: Small shop staff (inherited)
- **Revelation**: Shop is neutral ground for criminal negotiations
- **Conflict**: Gang expectations, police, community safety

## The Key Insight

The constraint becomes the catalyst; the outcasts become the heroes; the impossible becomes the inevitable. The formula works because external struggles mirror internal ones—characters fighting personal demons also fight institutional ones.

## Output Persistence

### Output Discovery
1. Check for `context/output-config.md` in the project
2. If found, look for this skill's entry
3. If not found, ask user: "Where should I save underdog unit designs?"
4. Suggest: `stories/units/` or `explorations/stories/`

### Primary Output
- **Mandate type** - Mission and enemy
- **Constraints** - 3-4 selected limitations
- **Team composition** - Outcasts with archetypes
- **Institutional dynamics** - Leadership relationship
- **Escalation plan** - Stakes progression

### File Naming
Pattern: `{unit-name}-underdog-{date}.md`

## Verification (Oracle)

### What This Skill Can Verify
- **Constraint count** - 3-4 constraints, not more? (High confidence)
- **Team dysfunction** - Do outcasts have real flaws? (Medium confidence)
- **Formula structure** - Core elements present? (High confidence)

### What Requires Human Judgment
- **Plausibility** - Would institution actually create this unit?
- **Team chemistry** - Will these outcasts generate interesting conflict?
- **Stakes calibration** - Is escalation appropriate for story length?

### Oracle Limitations
- Cannot assess whether team dynamics will be compelling
- Cannot predict reader sympathy for outcast characters

## Feedback Loop

### Session Persistence
- **Output location:** See `context/output-config.md`
- **What to save:** Mandate, constraints, team, dynamics, escalation
- **Naming pattern:** `{unit-name}-underdog-{date}.md`

### Cross-Session Learning
- Check for prior unit designs in this setting
- Ensure institutional consistency
- Failed unit dynamics inform anti-patterns

## Design Constraints

### This Skill Assumes
- Institution exists to work within/against
- Resources are genuinely limited
- Team members are genuinely flawed

### This Skill Does Not Handle
- **Individual character arcs** - Route to: character-arc
- **Institutional worldbuilding** - Route to: governance-systems
- **Scene pacing** - Route to: scene-sequencing

### Degradation Signals
- More than 4 constraints (implausible)
- Team immediately competent (no struggle)
- Institution converts at end (validates outcasts too easily)

## Reasoning Requirements

### Standard Reasoning
- Single constraint selection
- Individual outcast design
- Basic team assembly

### Extended Reasoning (ultrathink)
- **Full unit design** - [Why: all elements must balance]
- **Multi-season escalation** - [Why: long-term stakes progression]
- **Institutional integration** - [Why: unit must fit larger system]

**Trigger phrases:** "design the complete unit", "plan the full series", "how does the institution work"

## Execution Strategy

### Sequential (Default)
- Mandate before constraints
- Constraints before team
- Team before dynamics

### Parallelizable
- Designing multiple team members
- Research into different institutional models

### Subagent Candidates
| Task | Agent Type | When to Spawn |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Institutional research | general-purpose | When modeling on real organizations |
| Character development | general-purpose | When deepening individual outcasts |

## Context Management

### Approximate Token Footprint
- **Skill base:** ~3k tokens (formula + elements + variations)
- **With templates:** ~4k tokens
- **With full pitfalls:** ~4.5k tokens

### Context Optimization
- Focus on relevant formula variation
- Templates are starting points, not required
- Naming conventions are optional flavor

### When Context Gets Tight
- Prioritize: Core formula, current constraint set
- Defer: Full archetype list, all variations
- Drop: Quick-start templates, naming conventions

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Constraint Overload
**Pattern:** Stacking every possible limitation—no budget, no space, no authority, hostile leadership, skeleton crew, outdated tech, AND a sunset clause.
**Why it fails:** Beyond 3-4 constraints, the situation becomes implausible. Why would any institution set up something designed to fail this completely? Readers lose suspension of disbelief.
**Fix:** Pick 3-4 constraints maximum. Make them feel organic to the institution's logic. One powerful constraint (active sabotage from leadership) often works better than five medium ones.

### 2. Competence Without Struggle
**Pattern:** The outcast team immediately gels and starts solving cases through brilliant unconventional methods.
**Why it fails:** The formula requires earning competence. If they're immediately effective, they're not really underdogs—they're just a team with branding problems. The struggle IS the story.
**Fix:** Build in early failures. Show methods that don't work before finding ones that do. Let team friction create real problems before forging bonds.

### 3. Institutional Conversion
**Pattern:** By the end, the institution recognizes the unit's value, gives them resources, and admits it was wrong.
**Why it fails:** Real institutions rarely admit systemic error. Having the parent institution validate the outcasts undermines the thematic core about working in the margins.
**Fix:** Victories should be grudging acknowledgments at best. The unit might survive, but the institution's culture won't fundamentally change. Success comes despite the system, not because it evolves.

### 4. Perfect Team Complementarity
**Pattern:** Each outcast has exactly the skill the team needs, and their dysfunctions never actually impede the work.
**Why it fails:** The formula requires friction. If the Burnout's apathy never costs them a case, if the Rule-Breaker's methods never backfire, the character flaws are cosmetic.
**Fix:** Let dysfunctions have real consequences. The Has-Been's outdated methods should fail sometimes. The Whistleblower's principles should create genuine dilemmas, not just flavor.

### 5. Deus Ex Resources
**Pattern:** When the plot requires it, someone magically has a contact, favor, or skill that wasn't established.
**Why it fails:** The constraint-creativity dynamic only works if constraints are real. Pulling resources from nowhere violates the premise. The unit can't be scrappy AND have whatever they need.
**Fix:** Establish all key resources, contacts, and skills early. Solutions should emerge from previously established elements. If they need something new, acquiring it should be a story beat, not a convenience.
