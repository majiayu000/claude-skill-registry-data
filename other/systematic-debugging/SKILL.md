name: systematic-debugging
description: Finds the root cause of a bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior before proposing any fix. Use this whenever something is broken and the cause is not yet proven — a failing test, a production error, intermittent behavior, or a symptom that appeared after a change. Also use when a fix has been attempted and did not work, or when the same bug keeps coming back.

# Systematic debugging

## The rule

**No fix before the cause is proven.** A change that makes a symptom disappear without an
explanation has not fixed anything — it has moved the failure somewhere you are not looking.

## Method

1. **Reproduce it deterministically.** If you cannot make it happen on demand, you cannot know when
   it is fixed. Intermittent means you have not found the variable yet — order, timing, state,
   environment, data.
2. **Narrow the blast radius.** Bisect: which commit, which input, which branch, which layer. Halve
   the search space with each step rather than reading everything.
3. **State a hypothesis that can be wrong.** "The cache returns stale rows after a write" is a
   hypothesis. "Something is wrong with caching" is not.
4. **Test the hypothesis directly** — a log line, a breakpoint, a probe. Prove it, do not infer it.
5. **Explain the whole symptom.** If your cause explains the error but not why it started Tuesday,
   you have found *a* bug, not *the* bug.
6. **Fix, then verify by reverting.** Put the bug back and confirm the test fails again. This is the
   step people skip, and it is the one that proves causation rather than coincidence.

## Anti-patterns

- **Shotgun changes** — altering several things at once. Now you cannot attribute the fix.
- **"Probably a flake."** Not a diagnosis. A test that fails intermittently is reporting a real
  race, ordering dependency, or shared-state leak.
- **Fixing the symptom** — catching the exception, adding a retry, widening a timeout — without
  knowing what threw it.
- **Trusting the error message's location.** Where it surfaced is rarely where it originated.

## Return contract

State the reproduction, the proven cause, the fix, and the verification that the fix addresses that
cause specifically. Name anything you ruled out and how.
