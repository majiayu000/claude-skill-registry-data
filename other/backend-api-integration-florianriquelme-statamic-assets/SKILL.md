name: Backend API Integration
description: Generate production-ready Saloon-based API integrations for Laravel projects including connector classes, request classes, readonly DTOs, service layer methods with comprehensive error handling, and complete Pest test suites. Use this skill when integrating external APIs using Saloon, creating API request/response handlers, adding new API endpoints to existing services, building API client wrappers for third-party services, or setting up API communication with proper error handling and testing. This skill applies when working on files in app/Services/Api/, app/DataTransferObjects/Api/, creating Saloon connectors and requests, implementing API service methods, or writing API integration tests.
