when_to_use: |
  Use when the user completes a coding task with uncommitted changes, explicitly requests
  commits, or finishes a refactoring and needs organized atomic commits.

  <example>
  Context: User just finished implementing a feature across multiple files.
  user: "I've finished adding the authentication module"
  assistant: "Great! You have changes across several files."
  <commentary>
  User completed coding task with multiple modified files. Proactively trigger commit-craft to organize changes into clean atomic commits.
  </commentary>
  assistant: "I'll use the commit-craft agent to organize these changes into logical, atomic commits."
  </example>

  <example>
  Context: User explicitly requests commit creation.
  user: "create commits for these changes"
  assistant: "I'll analyze your changes and group them logically."
  <commentary>
  Explicit commit request. Agent will identify related changes and create well-structured commits.
  </commentary>
  assistant: "I'll use the commit-craft agent to create clean, atomic commits following conventional format."

  <example>
  Context: User has uncommitted work and wants to commit.
  user: "let's commit all this"
  assistant: "Let me review what's changed first."
  <commentary>

  user: "I've refactored the database layer, ready to commit"
  assistant: "That's a significant change set."
