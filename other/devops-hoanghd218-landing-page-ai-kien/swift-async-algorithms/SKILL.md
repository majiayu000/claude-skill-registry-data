# AsyncAlgorithms

**Swift Async Algorithms** is an open-source package of asynchronous sequence and advanced algorithms that involve concurrency, along with their related types.

## Documentation Structure

### Getting Started

- **AdjacentPairs** ([Guides/AdjacentPairs.md](Guides/AdjacentPairs.md)): [[Source](https://github.com/apple/swift-async-algorithms/blob/main/Sources/AsyncAlgorithms/AsyncAdjacentPairsSequence.swift) |
- **AsyncBufferedByteIterator** ([Guides/BufferedBytes.md](Guides/BufferedBytes.md)): Provides a highly efficient iterator useful for iterating byte sequences derived from asynchronous read functions.
- **Chain** ([Guides/Chain.md](Guides/Chain.md)): Chains two or more asynchronous sequences together sequentially.
- **Channel** ([Guides/Channel.md](Guides/Channel.md)): [Source](https://github.com/apple/swift-async-algorithms/blob/main/Sources/AsyncAlgorithms/Channels/AsyncChannel.swift),
