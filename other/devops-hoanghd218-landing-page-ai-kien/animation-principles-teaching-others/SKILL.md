# Teaching the 12 Principles Effectively

Teaching animation principles requires meeting students where they are. Here's how to communicate each principle at different levels.

## Teaching Strategies by Principle

### 1. Squash and Stretch
**Show first:** Bouncing ball exercise - universal, immediate, undeniable.
**Common confusion:** Students preserve shape instead of volume. Use clay demonstration.
**Key phrase:** "Volume stays the same, shape changes."

### 2. Anticipation
**Show first:** Video of real athletes - every jump has a crouch.
**Common confusion:** Making anticipation too large or too long.
**Key phrase:** "The audience needs a heads-up."

### 3. Staging
**Show first:** Silhouette test. If they can't read it as a shadow, it fails.
**Common confusion:** Cluttering with detail before establishing clarity.
**Key phrase:** "What's the ONE thing this frame says?"

### 4. Straight Ahead / Pose to Pose
**Show first:** Same action animated both ways - compare results.
**Common confusion:** Thinking one method is "correct."
**Key phrase:** "Pose to pose for control, straight ahead for discovery."

### 5. Follow Through / Overlapping
**Show first:** Slow-motion hair, fabric, tails. Nature demonstrates constantly.
**Common confusion:** Everything stopping at the same frame.
**Key phrase:** "Nothing stops at once. What's attached keeps going."

### 6. Slow In / Slow Out
**Show first:** Push a heavy box versus a light one. Spacing changes.
**Common confusion:** Even spacing (tweening syndrome).
**Key phrase:** "More drawings where it slows, fewer where it's fast."

### 7. Arcs
**Show first:** Trace hand during natural gesture - it curves.
**Common confusion:** Mechanical point-to-point movement.
**Key phrase:** "Almost everything curves. Straight lines are exceptions."

### 8. Secondary Action
**Show first:** Walking while talking on phone - multiple layers.
**Common confusion:** Secondary action competing with primary.
**Key phrase:** "It adds flavor but shouldn't steal the show."

### 9. Timing
**Show first:** Same action at 4, 8, 12, 24 frames - feel the difference.
**Common confusion:** Defaulting to same timing for everything.
**Key phrase:** "Timing is the acting. Same pose, different timing = different meaning."

### 10. Exaggeration
**Show first:** Compare photo reference to Disney interpretation.
**Common confusion:** Fear of pushing too far (more common than pushing too much).
**Key phrase:** "Find reality, then push 20% past it."

### 11. Solid Drawing
**Show first:** Turn a simple character 360 degrees. Volume must hold.
**Common confusion:** Drawing symbols instead of forms.
**Key phrase:** "Can you imagine walking around it?"

### 12. Appeal
**Show first:** Character lineup - which ones do you want to watch?
**Common confusion:** Thinking appeal means "pretty."
**Key phrase:** "Appeal is magnetic. Even villains need it."

## Teaching Sequence
Start with Timing + Squash/Stretch (bouncing ball). Add Arcs + Slow In/Out. Build complexity gradually. Staging and Appeal come later - they require visual vocabulary.
