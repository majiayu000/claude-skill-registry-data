# CVM White Glove Sales Process

A proven methodology for ensuring revenue realization through active involvement from discovery through implementation. This process prevents the common failure mode where deals close but volume never materializes.

## Core Philosophy

**White Glove = You Don't Leave**: Sales maintains active involvement through implementation to ensure volume commitments are honored and revenue is realized.

**Critical Insight**: Weeks 2-4 of implementation are where deals "slide into the ditch" if not actively managed.

## Stage-by-Stage Process

### Stage 02 - DISCOVERY-COMPLETE: Volume Reality Check

**Objective**: Convert aspirational numbers into realistic, committed volume.

**Critical Questions (The 32 Questions Framework)**:

1. "What commitments do you have to other carriers?"
2. "What volume do you NOT control?"
3. "What volume CAN'T flow through our network due to service limitations?"
4. "Of your total annual volume, what can we realistically win?"

**Outcome**: Calculate REAL volume within 10% variance.

**Example**: 
- Customer claims: 1M packages/year
- After discovery: 300K realistic (70% committed elsewhere, service limitations exclude others)
- Daily equivalent: 1,500 packages/day

**Documentation**: Record exclusions, commitments, and realistic projections in CRM notes.

### Stage 03 - RATE-CREATION: Pricing + Volume Commitment Lock

**Objective**: Tie pricing to specific volume commitments before proposal delivery.

**Critical Discussion**: "Based on this pricing structure, how much volume are we going to win?"

**Required Actions**:

1. **Calculate Volume Run Rates**:
   - Annual commitment
   - Daily/weekly run rate
   - Percentage of total volume

2. **Document Agreement**:
   - "At this price point, we're committing to [X] packages/day"
   - "Annual commitment: [Y] packages"
   - "Percentage of your total volume: [Z]%"

3. **Confirm Expectations**:
   - "Just to confirm, at these rates you're comfortable committing to [X] daily volume?"

**Why This Matters**: Prevents "15 packages/day" surprises during implementation.

---

### Stage 04 - PROPOSAL-SENT: Test Period Framework Negotiation

**Objective**: Establish clear test → ramp agreement BEFORE implementation begins.

**Customer Statement**: "We want to test for two weeks"

**Your Response Script**:

> "That makes complete sense. To ensure we have a meaningful test, I'd recommend we start with 30-50% of the committed volume—whatever feels appropriate based on your operational capacity. 
>
> Here's what I'd like to propose: We run the test for two weeks with [X%] of volume. During this period, we'll monitor transit times, billing accuracy, and overall service quality.
>
> **IF** performance meets expectations—transit times are on target, billing is accurate, and you have no operational issues—**THEN** we ramp to the full [Y packages/day] that we discussed during pricing.
>
> Do we have agreement on this approach?"

**Critical Components**:

- **Test Volume**: 30-50% of committed volume (meaningful sample)
- **Test Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Success Criteria**: Transit times, billing accuracy, operational smoothness
- **Ramp Agreement**: Full volume commitment if criteria met
- **Verbal Confirmation**: "Do we have agreement?"

**Documentation**: Email confirming test framework and ramp expectations.

### Stage 05 - SETUP-DOCS-SENT: Pre-Implementation Alignment

**Objective**: Reiterate agreements before implementation kickoff to prevent miscommunication.

**Pre-Kickoff Communication Template**:

> Subject: Implementation Kickoff - Volume Confirmation
>
> Hi [Customer Name],
>
> As we prepare for our implementation kickoff with [Implementation Team], I wanted to level-set on what we discussed during the sales process:
>
> **Test Period (Weeks 1-2)**:
> - Volume: [X] packages/day ([Y]% of total commitment)
> - Duration: 2 weeks from first pickup
> - Success criteria: Transit performance, billing accuracy, operational fit
>
> **Post-Test Ramp (Week 3+)**:
> - Target volume: [Z] packages/day
> - Ramp timing: Immediate upon successful test completion
> - Annual commitment: [A] packages
>
> [Implementation Team Lead] will be reaching out shortly to schedule training and coordinate logistics. I'll remain involved throughout implementation to ensure smooth execution.
>
> Please confirm this aligns with your expectations, and let me know if you have any questions.

**Why This Matters**: Sets clear expectations before implementation team engagement.

### Stage 06 - IMPLEMENTATION: White Glove Execution (CRITICAL PHASE)

**Objective**: Actively manage implementation to prevent volume shortfalls and ensure commitments are honored.

#### Week 1-2: The Critical Window

**Your Role - Shoulder to Shoulder**:

✅ Added to EVERY email chain with implementation team  
✅ On EVERY implementation call  
✅ Monitor all pickup confirmations  
✅ First 3-5 business days: Focus on operational execution, not transit tracking

**Jump-In Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1 - Contradiction Alert**:

*Trigger*: Customer or implementation team makes statement contradicting sales agreements.

*Example*:
- Customer: "Brett said we'd get next-day delivery to the Northeast"
- Implementation: "Our standard service is 2-3 days"

*Your Response*:
> "Let me jump in here to level-set. During our discussions, we outlined that our Expedited service provides 2-3 day delivery to most of the Northeast, with next-day delivery available in the immediate tri-state area through our JFK facility. [Customer], does that align with what you understood?"

**Scenario 2 - Volume Bait & Switch**:

*Trigger*: Customer proposes starting volume significantly below test agreement.

*Example*:
- Implementation: "Training is complete. Ready for first pickup?"
- Customer: "Yes, we'll start with 10-15 packages per day"

*Your Response*:
> "Hold on, let's make sure we're aligned. In our proposal discussion, we agreed to a test volume of [X] packages/day. That's what our network has been configured to support. What's changed that would prevent us from starting at that level?"

**Scenario 3 - "We'll Start Small and Ramp"**:

*Trigger*: Customer wants to start significantly below test volume without clear justification.

*Example*:
- Customer: "Let's start with 25 packages/day and build from there"
- Agreed test volume: 150 packages/day

*Your Response*:
> "I appreciate wanting to start carefully. However, our network economics and service quality are optimized for the [X] packages/day we discussed. Starting with 25 packages actually makes it harder for us to demonstrate our value proposition.
>
> Can you help me understand what's driving the desire to start lower? Is it operational bandwidth, confidence in the service, or something else? Let's address the root concern rather than adjusting volume expectations."

#### Proactive Success Indicators:

✅ Pickup confirmations with timestamps and BOL numbers  
✅ Volume tracking aligned with test expectations  
✅ No contradictions in implementation discussions  
✅ Customer questions are operational (how), not strategic (whether)

**Red Flags**:

🚩 Customer avoiding volume commitment discussions  
🚩 Significant gap between test agreement and actual volume  
🚩 "Let's wait and see" language about ramp timing  
🚩 New stakeholders introducing different expectations

### Stage 06 - POST-TEST (Day 15-30): Revenue Realization Enforcement

**Objective**: Convert successful test into committed volume ramp.

#### Ramp Enforcement Framework

**If Ramping as Planned**:

> "Excellent to see volume at [Y] packages/day. Performance has been strong—[X]% on-time delivery, billing has been clean. Let's schedule our 30-day business review to discuss expansion opportunities and explore what additional volume we can capture from other carriers."

**If NOT Ramping**:

**Step 1 - Performance Confirmation**:

> "We're on day 16 and still seeing test-level volume of [X] packages/day. Before we discuss the ramp, let me confirm: Are you satisfied with the transit performance, billing accuracy, and operational integration?"

**Step 2 - Gap Analysis** (if performance is satisfactory):

> "Given that performance has met expectations, our agreement was to ramp to [Y] packages/day. What's preventing the ramp from happening?"

**Common Objections & Responses**:

**Objection**: "We're too busy with other priorities"

*Response*:
> "I understand bandwidth is tight. What specific support do you need from our team to facilitate the ramp? We can provide additional integration support, training, documentation—whatever removes the friction."

**Objection**: "We want to extend the test"

*Response*:
> "Can you help me understand what metrics aren't meeting expectations? Our data shows [X]% on-time delivery and [Y] performance. What additional confidence would a longer test provide, and what specific thresholds would you need to see?"

**Objection**: "Volume isn't available right now"

*Response*:
> "During discovery, you mentioned [Y] packages/day. Has your business volume changed, or is this routing to other carriers? Let's revisit the commitment we agreed to and understand what's changed."

**Objection**: "We need to see how peak season goes"

*Response*:
> "That's reasonable for scaling beyond our commitment. However, our agreement was for [X] baseline volume outside of peak. Can we establish that baseline now and then discuss peak scaling separately?"

#### Escalation Path:

1. **First conversation**: Sales rep addresses directly (consultative)
2. **Second conversation**: Introduce data/performance reports (objective evidence)
3. **Third conversation**: Involve leadership (executive alignment)

**Critical Rule**: Never accept indefinite delays. Always establish next milestone or decision point.

### Stage 07 - CLOSED-WON: Continuous White Glove

**Objective**: Maintain volume commitments and identify expansion opportunities.

**Monthly Business Reviews**:

- Performance scorecards (transit time, on-time %, cost savings)
- Volume trending vs. commitment
- Issue resolution and continuous improvement
- Expansion opportunity identification

**Quarterly Volume Audits**:

- Compare actual vs. committed volume
- Identify volume leakage to other carriers
- Renegotiate commitments if business has changed
- Present expansion opportunities based on performance

**Proactive Questions**:

- "What other carriers are you currently using?"
- "What volume are you shipping that we don't currently handle?"
- "Where are we not meeting expectations?"
- "What additional services would enable you to shift more volume?"

## Key Principles

1. **"White Glove" means You Don't Leave**: Continue active involvement until volume commitments are fulfilled
2. **"Level Set" means Jump In Immediately**: Correct contradictions in real-time, don't wait
3. **"Hold Feet to Fire" means Enforce Agreements**: What was agreed in sales must happen in implementation
4. **"Very Slippery" means Stay Vigilant**: Weeks 2-4 of implementation are where deals die
5. **"Face to the Customer" means Own the Outcome**: You are responsible for revenue realization, not just deal closing

---

## When NOT to Use This Process

This white glove process is **NOT** appropriate for:

- Small accounts (<50 packages/day) where economics don't support intensive involvement
- Customers with established track record of meeting commitments
- Internal test accounts or partner integrations
- Situations where customer explicitly requests minimal sales involvement

For these scenarios, use standard implementation handoff process.

---

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure white glove effectiveness:

- **Test-to-Ramp Conversion**: % of successful tests that ramp to committed volume
- **Time to Full Volume**: Days from first shipment to committed daily run rate
- **Volume Variance**: Actual volume vs. committed volume at 30/60/90 days
- **Implementation Drop Rate**: % of deals that fail to launch after commitment

Target: >80% test-to-ramp conversion, <15% variance from committed volume at 90 days.
