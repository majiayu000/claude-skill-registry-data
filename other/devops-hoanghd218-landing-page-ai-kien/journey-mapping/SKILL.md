# Journey Mapping Toolkit Skill

## When to Use
- Kicking off new persona journeys or refreshing existing ones.
- Preparing workshops with stakeholders across marketing, product, CS, and sales.
- Auditing journey artifacts for consistency and completeness.

## Framework
1. **Preparation** – collect VOC findings, telemetry, and existing documentation; define scope, persona, and goals.
2. **Stage Definition** – align on lifecycle stages, success metrics, and ownership.
3. **Touchpoint Mapping** – capture channels, emotions, expectations, and supporting systems.
4. **Gap Identification** – document friction points, root causes, and opportunities.
5. **Action Linking** – connect gaps to initiatives, success metrics, and measurement plans.

## Templates
- Journey storyboard canvas (stage, touchpoint, emotion, KPI, owner).
- Persona one-pager with goals, pains, and preferred channels.
- Gap log sheet (issue, impact, evidence, owner, next step).

## Tips
- Keep sessions interactive with pre-read data and live polling.
- Include frontline voices (support, sales, CSMs) for real-world context.
- Version control maps so improvements are traceable over time.
