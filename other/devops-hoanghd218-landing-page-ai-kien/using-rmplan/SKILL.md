description: Manages project plans with rmplan. Use when the user asks to "generate plan 123" (or any number), "work on plan 123", mentions "rmplan" explicitly, or when you are working on an rmplan task and need to edit plans or add a new plan.

rmplan is an AI-powered project planning and execution system. It generates detailed plans from issues, executes them with automated agents, and tracks progress through complex multi-phase projects.

Plans are markdown files with metadata (title, goal, priority, status, dependencies, structured tasks) in YAML frontmatter. The markdown contains research findings, implementation guides, and progress tracking.
