# Timing Mastery

Think like a drummer. Animation is rhythm made visible. The space between beats matters as much as the beats themselves.

## Core Mental Model

Before animating anything, ask: **How many frames does this deserve?**

Timing is the soul of animation. The same motion at different speeds tells completely different stories. Fast = light, urgent, comedic. Slow = heavy, dramatic, thoughtful.

## The 12 Principles Through Timing

**Timing** — The principle itself. Count frames obsessively. A 6-frame action feels snappy. A 24-frame action feels deliberate. Know the vocabulary of duration.

**Slow In & Slow Out** — Time is elastic at the edges. Actions ease into existence and settle out of motion. The middles can be fast, but beginnings and endings need breath.

**Anticipation** — Timing creates suspense. Hold the anticipation longer than feels comfortable. The audience's tension builds in the pause before release.

**Follow Through & Overlapping Action** — Stagger your timing. Not everything arrives at once. Lead with the main action, let secondary elements catch up on their own schedules.

**Secondary Action** — Time secondary elements to complement, not compete. They should land slightly after the primary beat, like harmony following melody.

**Staging** — Give the audience time to read. Fast cutting confuses. Hold important poses long enough for comprehension. Clarity requires duration.

**Exaggeration** — Timing amplifies exaggeration. A long anticipation followed by instant action creates snap. Stretch time to stretch impact.

**Squash & Stretch** — Speed determines deformation. Fast motion = more stretch. Impact = instant squash. The timing of shape change sells velocity.

**Arcs** — Speed varies along the arc. Fastest at the bottom of a swing, slowest at the apex. Timing follows the physics of pendulums.

**Appeal** — Rhythmic motion is appealing. Characters with good timing feel alive. Arrhythmic timing creates unease (useful for villains or horror).

**Straight Ahead & Pose to Pose** — Time your key poses first (pose to pose), then decide how many frames connect them. Or discover timing organically (straight ahead) and refine.

**Solid Drawing** — Volume must read at speed. Fast-moving objects need exaggerated stretch or motion blur. Solid drawing at the wrong timing looks frozen.

## Practical Application

When action feels "rushed":
1. Add more frames to anticipation
2. Hold key poses 2-4 frames longer
3. Slow the ease-out to let actions settle
4. Insert "moving holds" instead of dead stops

When action feels "sluggish":
1. Reduce in-between frames
2. Cut anticipation duration
3. Increase contrast between fast and slow sections
4. Remove frames from less important movements

**Timing Chart:**
- Blink: 2-4 frames
- Quick gesture: 6-8 frames
- Walk cycle: 12-16 frames per step
- Emotional reaction: 8-12 frames + hold
- Heavy impact: 2 frames contact, 12+ frames settle

## The Golden Rule

**Timing is relative.** Fast only feels fast next to slow. Build contrast. Let quiet moments make loud moments louder. A pause before a punchline is what makes it land.
