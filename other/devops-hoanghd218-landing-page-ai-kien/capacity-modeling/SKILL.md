# Capacity Modeling Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- During annual/quarterly planning to align hiring with revenue goals.
- Stress testing bookings plans with upside/downside scenarios.
- Preparing CRO/finance readouts on coverage gaps and productivity.

## Framework
1. **Assumption Library** – document ramp curves, win rates, ACV, hours per deal, attrition.
2. **Scenario Engine** – plug assumptions into base/upside/downside tables.
3. **Gap Analysis** – highlight where capacity misses coverage vs target.
4. **Mitigation Paths** – propose levers (hiring, enablement, pricing, partner attach).
5. **Communication Kit** – summarize risks/opportunities for leadership decisions.

## Templates
- Capacity workbook tabs (inputs, scenarios, summary).
- CRO briefing deck outline.
- Hiring + enablement recommendation log.

## Tips
- Keep assumptions versioned to avoid stale models.
- Tie recommendations to time-to-productivity and pipeline coverage KPIs.
- Pair with `quota-health` to see downstream impact of headcount changes.
