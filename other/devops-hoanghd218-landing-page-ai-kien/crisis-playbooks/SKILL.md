# Crisis Communications Playbooks Skill

## When to Use
- Service outages, security incidents, compliance/regulatory events.
- Negative press cycles or social media escalations.
- Sensitive executive/HR news requiring coordinated messaging.

## Framework
1. **Severity Matrix** – classify incidents (P1-P4) with response SLAs and approvers.
2. **Escalation Tree** – who to notify, in what order, via which channels.
3. **Message Kits** – holding statements, customer/partner/internal scripts, social/status updates.
4. **Channel Sequence** – timeline for status page, email, press, social, internal posts.
5. **Monitoring & Recovery** – tracking sentiment, rumor control, follow-up updates.

## Templates
- Incident briefing doc (facts, unknowns, owners, deadlines).
- Approval checklist for legal/security/executive signoff.
- Post-incident report with RCA, comms metrics, and improvement actions.

## Tips
- Rehearse quarterly with tabletop exercises.
- Keep localized versions for regulated markets.
- Archive every incident’s comms artifacts for compliance and learning.
