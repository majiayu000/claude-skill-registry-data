# Advocate Sourcing Skill

## When to Use
- Building reference pools, speaker rosters, or customer advisory councils.
- Auditing advocacy coverage by region, persona, or product.
- Refreshing advocate tiers after product launches or org changes.

## Framework
1. **Signal Collection** – product usage, NPS, expansion, support interactions, community engagement.
2. **Scoring Model** – weight value delivered, relationship strength, storytelling potential, and risk.
3. **Tiering** – classify advocates into spotlight, reference-ready, nurture, and do-not-contact.
4. **Consent & Compliance** – track legal approvals, NDAs, and data sharing requirements.
5. **Backlog Management** – log asks, upcoming opportunities, and fatigue limits.

## Templates
- Advocate roster spreadsheet with scoring columns and program tags.
- Coverage heatmap by persona/region.
- Outreach tracker (advocate → ask → owner → status).

## Tips
- Partner with CS to capture qualitative context before outreach.
- Rotate advocates to avoid burnout and capture fresh stories.
- Keep consent status synced with CRM/legal systems.
