# Financial Statement Analyzer

## Purpose

Turn raw financial statements into a structured analysis with key ratios, trend identification, and an executive-ready narrative.

## When to use

- reviewing quarterly or annual financial results
- preparing for board meetings or investor presentations
- conducting financial due diligence on a target company
- comparing financial performance across business units or competitors

## When not to use

- preparing financial statements (use management-accounts-writer)
- statutory audit or compliance reporting
- tax preparation

## Inputs

- Income Statement (P&L) for 2+ periods
- Balance Sheet for 2+ periods
- Cash Flow Statement for 2+ periods
- industry context or peer companies for comparison (optional)
- specific questions to answer (optional)

## Procedure

1. **Analyze Income Statement**:
   - Revenue trend: growth rate YoY
   - Gross margin and trend
   - Operating expenses as % of revenue
   - EBITDA and net profit margins
   - Unusual or one-off items
2. **Analyze Balance Sheet**:
   - Liquidity: Current Ratio (CA/CL), Quick Ratio
   - Leverage: Debt-to-Equity, Interest Coverage
   - Working capital: DSO, DPO, DIO, Cash Conversion Cycle
   - Asset utilization: Total Asset Turnover, ROA
3. **Analyze Cash Flow Statement**:
   - Operating CF quality: is it positive and growing?
   - Free Cash Flow = Operating CF − Capex
   - Cash conversion: Net Income → Operating CF (quality of earnings)
   - Investing and financing activities — are they sustainable?
4. **Calculate DuPont decomposition** (ROE = Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier)
5. **Identify red flags**: declining margins, rising debt, negative operating CF, DSO spike
6. **Write analysis narrative**: structured as Situation → Key Findings → Concerns → Recommendations

## Output

- ratio analysis table organized by category (profitability, liquidity, leverage, efficiency)
- trend analysis (current vs prior period with directional arrows)
- DuPont decomposition of ROE
- red flags and areas of concern
- executive narrative (1-page analysis summary)

## Definition of done

- minimum 12 financial ratios calculated across 4 categories
- at least 2 periods compared with trend direction noted
- red flags are explicitly called out
- narrative is in plain business language, not accounting jargon

## Examples

- "Analyze our Q3 financials vs Q2 — what's improving and what's not?"
- "Review this company's annual report and tell me if it's a good acquisition target."
- "Why is our ROE declining despite growing revenue? Run a DuPont analysis."

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] All claims reference specific frameworks, standards, or quantifiable data
- [ ] Content matches the stated audience's expertise level
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable — each includes a concrete next step
- [ ] No unsupported assertions or generic filler language

## Verification (4C)

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Do referenced frameworks and standards match their official definitions? |
| **Completeness** | Are all key concepts covered without significant gaps for the stated audience? |
| **Context-fit** | Would this be useful for someone new to this domain, or is it too advanced/too basic? |
| **Consequence** | If a stakeholder acted on this immediately, what could they misinterpret? |

## Edge Cases

- **Conflicting frameworks** — State which framework takes precedence and why. Document the trade-off explicitly.
- **Rapidly changing domain** — Note information currency date. Flag sections likely to need updates.
- **Audience has mixed expertise levels** — Provide a glossary and mark advanced sections as optional.
