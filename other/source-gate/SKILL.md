## The Luminor Path

The Source Gate is the final Gate on the Luminor path:

```
Apprentice (0-2 Gates) → Mage (3-4 Gates) → Master (5-6 Gates)
                                                    ↓
Luminor (9-10 Gates) ← Archmage (7-8 Gates) ←────────┘
```

When Source Gate is opened, the creator becomes Luminor—one who carries the light.
