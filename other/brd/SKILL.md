# Book Requirements Document (BRD) Creation

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating a complete Book Requirements Document through systematic interviewing and structured analysis.

## BRD Template Structure

A complete BRD captures everything needed before task generation:

```markdown
# Book Requirements Document

## Core
- **Working Title**:
- **Genre/Category**:

- **Target Audience**:

- **One-Sentence Summary**:

## Structure
- **Format**: (chapters, parts, sections)
- **POV**: (first, third, omniscient)
- **Tense**: (past, present)
- **Timeline**: (linear, non-linear, multiple)

## Voice
- **Tone**: (academic, conversational, literary, journalistic)
- **Comparable Titles**: ("X meets Y")

## Characters (Fiction) / Key Concepts (Non-Fiction)
| Name | Description | Relationships |

## Systematic Question Framework

Ask questions in this order to build a complete picture. Each section builds on previous answers.

### 1. Core Questions

**Purpose**: Establish the fundamentals that guide all other decisions.

- "What's your working title, or what would you like to call this project for now?"
- "What genre or category does this fall into?" (fiction, nonfiction, memoir, technical, hybrid)
- "What's your target word count?" (helps determine scope and structure)
- "Who is your target audience?" (age, background, interests, reading level)

**Follow-up probes**:
- If audience unclear: "Who needs this book? What problem does it solve for them?"
- If word count vague: "Are you thinking novella (20-40k), standard novel (60-90k), epic (100k+), or something else?"

### 2. Thesis/Premise Questions

**Purpose**: Clarify the central idea that holds the book together.

- "Can you summarize this book in one sentence?"
- For **fiction**: "What's the central question or conflict your protagonist faces?"
- For **nonfiction**: "What's the core argument or thesis you're making?"
- "What should readers take away after finishing?"

**Follow-up probes**:
- If summary too detailed: "What's the elevator pitch version?"
- If takeaway unclear: "If readers remember only one thing, what should it be?"
- "What makes this different from similar books?"

### 3. Structure Questions

**Purpose**: Determine the organizational framework.

- "How will you structure this?" (chapters, parts, acts, sections, essays)
- **Fiction-specific**: "What POV?" (first person, third limited, omniscient, multiple POVs)
- **Fiction-specific**: "What tense?" (past, present, future)
- "Is the timeline linear, or will you use flashbacks, multiple timelines, or non-chronological structure?"

**Follow-up probes**:
- If structure uncertain: "Do you have a natural breaking point in mind, like acts or major sections?"
- For multiple POVs: "Which characters get POV chapters?"
- For complex timelines: "How many timelines, and how will you signal shifts?"

### 4. Voice Questions

**Purpose**: Define the style and tone.

- "How would you describe the tone?" (academic, conversational, literary, journalistic, humorous, dark, lyrical)
- "What books are comparable in style or approach?" (use "X meets Y" format)
- "Do you have any sample passages that capture the voice you're aiming for?"

**Follow-up probes**:
- If tone vague: "Is it formal or casual? Technical or accessible? Serious or playful?"
- "How much authorial presence do you want? Invisible narrator or strong voice?"
- For nonfiction: "Will you use 'I', 'we', or stay third-person objective?"

### 5. Characters/Concepts Questions

**Purpose**: Identify key entities (people for fiction, ideas for nonfiction).

**For Fiction**:
- "Who are your main characters?"
- For each character: "What's their role, motivation, and key relationships?"
- "Are there important secondary characters?"

**For Nonfiction**:
- "What are the key concepts or ideas you'll explore?"
- For each concept: "How does it relate to your thesis?"
- "Are there case studies, examples, or recurring themes?"

**Follow-up probes**:
- "Who changes the most over the course of the book?"
- "Are there antagonistic forces (characters, systems, ideas)?"
- "What relationships drive the narrative/argument?"

### 6. Research Sources Questions

**Purpose**: Identify existing knowledge and gaps.

- "What research have you already done?"
- "Do you have primary sources?" (interviews, documents, firsthand experience)
- "What secondary sources will you draw from?" (books, articles, papers)
- "Are there URLs, PDFs, or files you want to ingest as starting material?"

**Follow-up probes**:
- "What areas do you still need to research?"
- "Are there specific experts, archives, or databases you plan to consult?"
- "For fiction: What factual elements need research?" (historical periods, technical details, locations)

### 7. Constraints Questions

**Purpose**: Clarify boundaries and sensitivities.

- "Is there anything you must include?" (themes, scenes, arguments, acknowledgments)
- "Is there anything you want to avoid?" (clichés, topics, approaches)
- "Are there sensitivity considerations?" (trauma, cultural representation, controversial topics)

**Follow-up probes**:
- "Who might critique this work, and what concerns might they raise?"
- "Are there legal, ethical, or personal boundaries?"
- "Do you have publisher requirements or format constraints?"

## Best Practices for Thorough Interviewing

### Ask Open-Ended Questions First
Start broad ("Tell me about this book") before narrowing ("What's the inciting incident?").

### Listen for Gaps
If an answer is vague, probe deeper. "Can you say more about that?" is your friend.

### Reflect Back
Paraphrase answers to confirm understanding: "So you're saying the protagonist's core conflict is..."

### Watch for Contradictions
If structure says "linear" but plot summary jumps timelines, ask which is correct.

### Don't Rush
A complete BRD may take 15-20 questions. Incomplete BRDs lead to poor task generation.

### Confirm Key Details
Before finalizing, summarize the BRD and ask: "Does this capture your vision?"

## Genre-Specific Considerations

### Fiction
- **Plot arc**: Three-act structure, hero's journey, episodic?
- **Character development**: Who has the most significant arc?
- **Setting**: Time period, location, world-building needs
- **Subplots**: Romance, mystery, secondary character arcs?
- **Tone consistency**: Comic relief in thriller? Dark humor in literary fiction?

### Nonfiction
- **Argument structure**: Thesis-driven, exploratory, case study-based?
- **Evidence types**: Academic research, interviews, personal narrative, data?
- **Reader engagement**: Prescriptive (how-to) or descriptive (analysis)?
- **Authority**: How do you establish credibility?
- **Examples**: Will you use anecdotes, case studies, statistics?

### Memoir
- **Truth vs narrative**: How will you balance factual accuracy with story?
- **Privacy**: Whose stories are you telling, and do you have permission?
- **Time span**: Entire life or focused period?
- **Thematic focus**: What's the through-line beyond chronology?

### Technical/Reference
- **Audience expertise**: Beginner, intermediate, expert?
- **Completeness**: Comprehensive reference or focused guide?
- **Examples**: Code samples, diagrams, step-by-step tutorials?
- **Updates**: How will you handle changing information?

## Validation Criteria for Complete BRD

Before marking a BRD complete, verify:

- [ ] All core fields populated (title, genre, word count, audience)
- [ ] Clear one-sentence summary exists
- [ ] Structure is defined (format, POV/approach, timeline)
- [ ] Voice/tone is described with examples
- [ ] Key entities (characters/concepts) are named with descriptions
- [ ] Research sources are identified (even if "none yet")
- [ ] Constraints section addresses must-include, must-avoid, sensitivities
- [ ] No contradictions between sections (e.g., POV vs sample passage)
- [ ] User confirms BRD captures their vision

## Storage

Once complete:
1. Generate `BRD.md` file in project root
2. Store in database with `CREATE brd SET content=$brd_content, version=1`
3. Confirm file creation and database entry to user
