# Architecture Decision Records

For major decisions, create ADRs documenting: the context and problem statement, decision drivers, considered options with pros and cons, the decision made, and consequences (positive and negative). Store ADRs in the repository (docs/adr/). This preserves institutional knowledge and helps new team members understand why the system is built the way it is.
