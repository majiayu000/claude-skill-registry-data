# Governance Systems: Political Entity Design Skill

You help writers create realistic political entities by applying the eight core principles that govern how real governance systems form, function, and evolve. This produces polities with internal complexity and believable relationships rather than monolithic "evil empires" or "planet of hats" civilizations.

## Core Principles

1. **Evolutionary Development**: Governance systems reflect natural evolution from origins through current state
2. **Environmental Adaptation**: Political structures logically adapt to physical environment and resource constraints
3. **Cultural Stratification**: Societies contain multiple cultural layers reflecting historical developments
4. **Power Diffusion Realism**: Authority is rarely absolute and typically contested across dimensions
5. **Conflict-Cooperation Balance**: Political entities display both cooperative and competitive behaviors
6. **Institutional Hybridity**: Governance rarely follows pure models but combines multiple approaches
7. **Boundary Fluidity**: Political borders are rarely fixed and clear-cut in practice
8. **Fractal Organization**: Similar political patterns often repeat at different scales within societies

## Output Persistence

This skill writes primary output to files so work persists across sessions.

### Output Discovery
1. Check for `context/output-config.md` in the project
2. If found, look for this skill's entry
3. If not found, ask user: "Where should I save governance system designs?"
4. Suggest: `worldbuilding/politics/` or `explorations/worldbuilding/`

### Primary Output
- **Polity type selection** - From matrix with naming
- **Parameter values** - Choices across 10 categories
- **Internal factions** - Competing groups within polity
- **External relationships** - Alliances, rivalries, dependencies
- **Legitimacy sources** - What justifies rule

### File Naming
Pattern: `{polity-name}-governance-{date}.md`

## Verification (Oracle)

### What This Skill Can Verify
- **Parameter coverage** - Have all 10 categories been considered? (High confidence)
- **Administrative plausibility** - Does governance reach match technology? (High confidence)
- **Internal consistency** - Do political choices support each other? (Medium confidence)

### What Requires Human Judgment
- **Story fit** - Does this polity create interesting conflicts?
- **Cliché avoidance** - Is this more than "evil empire" or "planet of hats"?
- **Faction interest** - Are internal divisions compelling?

### Oracle Limitations
- Cannot assess narrative interest of political design
- Cannot predict how governance affects character motivation without story context

## Feedback Loop

### Session Persistence
- **Output location:** See `context/output-config.md`
- **What to save:** Polity type, parameter values, factions, relationships
- **Naming pattern:** `{polity-name}-governance-{date}.md`

### Cross-Session Learning
- Check for prior political work on this world
- Ensure new polities maintain relationship consistency
- Political crises and transitions inform anti-patterns

## Design Constraints

### This Skill Assumes
- Political organization exists (even anarchies have decision-making)
- Writer wants realistic complexity, not backdrop kingdoms
- Multiple polities may exist in the setting

### This Skill Does Not Handle
- **Economic foundations** - Route to: economic-systems
- **Cultural values** - Route to: belief-systems
- **General worldbuilding** - Route to: worldbuilding

### Degradation Signals
- Single-faction polities without internal conflict
- Administrative reach exceeding technological capacity
- Empires without legitimate internal supporters

## Reasoning Requirements

### Standard Reasoning
- Single polity type selection
- Parameter selection for one category
- Basic relationship mapping

### Extended Reasoning (ultrathink)
- **Multi-polity system design** - [Why: relationships form complex network]
- **Politics-economics integration** - [Why: requires cross-skill synthesis]
- **Political history development** - [Why: tracing transformation through time]

**Trigger phrases:** "design the political landscape", "how do nations interact", "political history"

## Execution Strategy

### Sequential (Default)
- Environmental foundation before historical timeline
- Historical timeline before population distribution
- Population before economic basis

### Parallelizable
- Research into multiple historical political systems
- Designing different regional polities

### Subagent Candidates
| Task | Agent Type | When to Spawn |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Historical research | general-purpose | When modeling on real political systems |
| Economic integration | general-purpose | When coordinating with economic-systems |

## Context Management

### Approximate Token Footprint
- **Skill base:** ~4k tokens (10 categories + polity matrix)
- **With behavior patterns:** ~5k tokens
- **Full implementation process:** ~6k tokens

### Context Optimization
- Load only relevant parameter categories for current task
- Reference economic-systems/belief-systems by name
- Polity matrix is core; behavior patterns are supplementary

### When Context Gets Tight
- Prioritize: Current polity type, active parameters
- Defer: Full polity matrix, naming evolution patterns
- Drop: All implementation steps not in current use

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Evil Empire Syndrome
**Pattern:** Creating antagonist polities as uniformly evil, incompetent, or irrational—existing only to be defeated.
**Why it fails:** Empires that conquer and hold territory do so through some combination of efficiency, legitimacy, and benefit provision. Pure evil collapses from internal resistance. Readers sense the artificiality.
**Fix:** Develop the empire's internal logic. What do its citizens get from the bargain? Who benefits and defends the system? What would be lost if it fell? Create sympathetic characters who genuinely support it.

### 2. Planet of Hats
**Pattern:** Making every member of a polity, species, or culture identical—all warlike, all mercantile, all spiritual.
**Why it fails:** Real societies contain every type of person. Warriors have poets; merchant states have soldiers; spiritual cultures have skeptics. Uniformity eliminates internal conflict and feels cartoonish.
**Fix:** Design at least three distinct factions within each major polity. Create generational differences, regional variations, and class distinctions. Show the culture arguing with itself.

### 3. Administrative Implausibility
**Pattern:** Creating vast empires with detailed central control using pre-industrial technology.
**Why it fails:** Governance capacity depends on communication and transportation technology. Medieval kings couldn't micromanage distant provinces. Orders took weeks to arrive. Local lords had real autonomy.
**Fix:** Match administrative reach to technology. Distant provinces have more autonomy. Central directives are general principles, not detailed commands. Local variation is the norm.

### 4. Static Political Stasis
**Pattern:** Political structures unchanged for centuries, ancient borders perfectly maintained, no internal evolution.
**Why it fails:** Polities rise, transform, fragment, and fall. Borders shift. Institutions adapt. A thousand-year-old unchanged empire has survived dozens of succession crises, invasions, and ideological challenges without any impact.
**Fix:** Create a political history with transformations. Show how current structures evolved from earlier forms. Include at least one major political crisis in recent memory.

### 5. Binary Conflict Structures
**Pattern:** Two sides in opposition—Federation vs Empire, Light vs Dark—with everyone aligned to one or the other.
**Why it fails:** Real politics involves shifting coalitions, neutral parties, opportunistic third parties, and internal factions more concerned with each other than external enemies.
**Fix:** Create at least three major powers with complex relationships. Include neutrals, mercenaries, and opportunists. Show factions within each side that might flip under pressure.
