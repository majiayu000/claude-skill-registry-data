# Suggest PR

## Git Command Safety

NEVER use `cd <path> && git` compound commands — they trigger security approval prompts. Run `git` commands directly (the working directory is already the target repo), or use `git -C <path>` if you need to target a different directory.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Determine the Base Branch

Run the following to identify the base branch:

```bash
git remote show origin | grep "HEAD branch" | sed 's/.*: //'
```

If this fails, fall back to `main` or `master` (whichever exists).

Store the result as `BASE_BRANCH`.

### Step 2: Gather Branch Information

Run these commands to collect all information about the current branch's changes:

```bash
git branch --show-current                           # Current branch name
git log origin/${BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD --oneline        # All commits on this branch
git log origin/${BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD --format="%s%n%b" # Full commit messages with bodies
git diff origin/${BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD --stat           # Changed files overview
```

### Step 3: Analyze the Diff for Context

For a thorough understanding, also run:

```bash
git diff origin/${BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD --name-only     # List of all changed files
```

If the changeset is complex (many files across multiple areas), also run:

```bash
git diff origin/${BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD                  # Full diff for deeper analysis
```

### Step 4: Generate PR Title

Create a concise PR title (under 70 characters):

- Use imperative mood ("Add", "Fix", "Update", "Refactor")
- Be specific about what changed
- Match the repository's existing PR/commit style

### Step 5: Generate PR Summary

Produce a markdown summary with these sections:

#### Required Sections

`# Summary` — A brief overview of what this PR accomplishes and why, written as **bullet points** (not a paragraph). Each bullet should be a single short line. Must be rendered as a markdown heading with a single `#`.

`# Changes` — Categorized list of all changes. Must be rendered as a markdown heading with a single `#`. Group and prefix with emojis:

| Category | Emoji | When to Use |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| New features | :sparkles: | New functionality added |
| Bug fixes | :bug: | Bugs fixed, errors resolved |
| Breaking changes | :boom: | Breaking API or behavior changes |
| Refactoring | :recycle: | Code restructured without behavior change |
| Documentation | :memo: | Docs, README, comments |
| Configuration | :wrench: | Config files, build settings |
| Performance | :zap: | Performance improvements |
| Styling | :art: | Code formatting, style changes |
| Dependencies | :package: | Dependency updates |
| Removal | :fire: | Removed code or files |
| Security | :lock: | Security fixes or improvements |
| CI/CD | :construction_worker: | Pipeline, build, deployment changes |

#### Optional Sections (include when relevant)

`# Breaking Changes` — Detail any breaking changes with migration steps.

### Step 6: Output Format

Wrap the entire PR suggestion inside a **markdown code fence** (triple backticks). This prevents the terminal from rendering `#` signs as headings — the user needs them as literal characters for copy-paste into a PR description.

**Output ONLY the fenced code block — nothing else.** Do not add any preamble before it or commentary after it: no branch analysis, no "this branch is N commits ahead", no summary of what you did, no closing remarks, no offers to help further. The fenced block is the complete response. Stop immediately after the closing fence.

**Every line must be self-contained — never break a sentence or bullet across multiple lines.** The output is displayed in a terminal code block. If a line exceeds the terminal width, the terminal soft-wraps it and injects whitespace. When the user copies that text, those extra spaces and line breaks come along, requiring manual cleanup. To prevent this:

- Use bullet points everywhere (including Summary) — not flowing paragraphs
- Keep each bullet under 72 characters
- If a bullet is too long, split into two separate bullets or shorten the wording
- Never continue a bullet point on a second line

Use this structure:

````
```
PR Title: <the suggested title>

# Summary

- Improve git skills for staged-only changes
- Fix copy-paste issues in PR output format
- Bump git plugin version to 3.1.0

# Changes

### :sparkles: Features
- Add new auth endpoint for OAuth2 flow
- Implement token refresh mechanism

### :bug: Fixes
- Fix null reference in user profile loading
- Resolve race condition in session management

### :recycle: Refactoring
- Simplify database query builder logic
- Extract common validation into shared module

### :memo: Documentation
- Update API reference for new auth endpoints
```
````

## Rules

**ALWAYS:**
- Base the summary ONLY on actual commits and diffs from THIS invocation
- Run the git commands every time - never assume or remember previous state
- Use emojis for change categories as specified above
- Group related changes together under appropriate categories
- Write in imperative mood for change descriptions

**NEVER include:**
- Test counts, test pass/fail statistics, or test coverage numbers
- The "Generated with Claude Code" footer or any Claude attribution
- Co-Authored-By lines
- Implementation details that are obvious from the code
- File-by-file listings (summarize by feature/area instead)
- Empty categories (only show categories that have changes)
- A `# Notes` section or any extra reviewer notes — the PR body is only `# Summary`, `# Changes`, and optionally `# Breaking Changes`
- Flowing paragraphs — use bullet points for everything
- Lines longer than 72 characters — shorten or split
- Multi-line bullets — each bullet must be one line only
- Any text outside the code fence — no preamble, no trailing notes, branch analysis, or commentary

## Guidelines

- Keep the PR title under 70 characters
- Keep change descriptions concise but informative (focus on the "what" and "why")
- If the branch has many commits, synthesize them into logical groups rather than listing each commit
- Match the tone and style of the repository's existing PRs when possible
- If commits follow Conventional Commits format, use that to inform categorization
