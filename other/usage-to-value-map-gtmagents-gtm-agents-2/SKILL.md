# Usage-to-Value Map Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing exec readouts showing how product usage ties to business outcomes.
- Prioritizing adoption plays based on feature depth, collaboration, or workflow coverage.
- Equipping sales/CS with quantified value proof for renewal/expansion cycles.

## Framework
1. **Telemetry Layer** – identify key events, feature usage, seat adoption, and integration data.
2. **Value Drivers** – map telemetry to business KPIs (time saved, revenue uplift, compliance risk).
3. **Benchmarking** – compare against cohort medians, champions, or best-in-class customers.
4. **Signal→Play Mapping** – tie usage patterns to recommended plays (exec briefing, enablement, upsell).
5. **Narrative Template** – structure story: context → usage signal → value proof → action.

## Templates
- Usage-to-value canvas (signal, KPI, benchmark, recommended play).
- Dashboard outline with spark lines + annotations for exec consumption.
- Email/slide snippet for sharing value proof with stakeholders.

## Tips
- Blend quantitative telemetry with qualitative proof (quotes, case studies) for credibility.
- Update benchmarks quarterly to reflect product releases and customer mix.
- Pair with `build-land-adopt-expand-plan` and `prepare-board-readout` for consistent storytelling.
