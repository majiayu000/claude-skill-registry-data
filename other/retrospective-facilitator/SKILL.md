# Retrospective Facilitator

The Retrospective Facilitator skill helps teams conduct effective retrospectives that drive continuous improvement. It provides structured formats, facilitation techniques, and follow-through mechanisms to ensure retrospectives generate actionable insights rather than just venting sessions.

This skill excels at creating psychological safety, guiding productive discussions, synthesizing patterns from team feedback, facilitating prioritization of improvements, and ensuring action items are tracked and completed.

Retrospective Facilitator follows the Agile principle of continuous improvement: regularly reflect on what's working, what's not, and commit to specific improvements. The goal is learning and action, not blame or complaint.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Prepare for Retrospective

**Before the meeting:**

1. **Choose Retro Format**
   - Consider team mood and context
   - Vary format to keep it fresh (don't repeat same format every time)
   - Match format to situation:
     - Struggling team: Sailboat, Speed Car
     - Good velocity: Start/Stop/Continue, 4 L's
     - After incident: Timeline, Fishbone
     - New team: Hot Air Balloon, Mad/Sad/Glad
   - Prepare format-specific materials

2. **Review Data**
   - Sprint metrics (velocity, burndown)
   - Completed vs. committed work
   - Bug counts and quality metrics
   - Team happiness/satisfaction scores
   - Previous retro action items (were they done?)

3. **Set Up Space**
   - Book meeting room or set up virtual board (Miro, Mural, FigJam)
   - Prepare timers and collaboration tools
   - Create sections for chosen format
   - Ensure everyone can participate equally

4. **Remind Team**
   - Send reminder with time and location
   - Share retro format in advance
   - Ask team to come prepared with thoughts
   - Emphasize psychological safety and respect

**Output:** Prepared retro environment with chosen format and data review.

### Workflow 2: Facilitate Retrospective Session

**Time-box: 60 minutes for 2-week sprint**

#### Phase 1: Set the Stage (5 min)
**Purpose**: Create safe space and focus attention

1. Welcome team and state purpose
2. Review retro norms:
   - Vegas rule: What's said here, stays here
   - No blame, focus on learning
   - Everyone's input matters equally
   - Assume good intent
3. Brief check-in: One word to describe sprint
4. Review previous action items (were they done?)

#### Phase 2: Gather Data (15 min)
**Purpose**: Collect team's observations and feelings

1. Introduce retro format and sections
2. **Silent writing** (5-10 min):
   - Each person adds sticky notes to board
   - Encourage specific examples, not generalizations
   - Quantity over quality at this stage
3. **Read and cluster** (5 min):
   - Quick readout of all items (no discussion yet)
   - Group similar themes together
   - Facilitator or team members can cluster

**Formats include**:
- Start/Stop/Continue
- Mad/Sad/Glad
- 4 L's (Liked/Learned/Lacked/Longed For)
- Sailboat (Wind/Anchor/Rocks/Island)
- Plus/Delta
- Timeline

#### Phase 3: Generate Insights (15 min)
**Purpose**: Find patterns and understand root causes

1. **Identify themes**:
   - Which clusters have most items?
   - What patterns emerge?
   - Any surprises or new insights?

2. **Discussion**:
   - Dive deeper into top 3-5 themes
   - Ask "why" to get to root causes (5 Whys technique)
   - Ensure all voices heard
   - Facilitator keeps discussion productive

3. **Vote on priorities** (optional):
   - Each person gets 3-5 votes
   - Vote on issues most important to address
   - Focuses improvement efforts

#### Phase 4: Decide What to Do (15 min)
**Purpose**: Commit to specific improvements

1. **Choose 1-3 improvements**:
   - Based on voting and discussion
   - Must be specific and actionable
   - Achievable within next sprint

2. **Create action items**:
   - For each improvement:
     - What specifically will we do?
     - Who will own it?
     - When will it be done?
     - How will we know it worked?
   - Use SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

3. **Commitment**:
   - Team agrees to action items
   - Add to sprint backlog or tracking system
   - Set reminder to check progress

#### Phase 5: Close (10 min)
**Purpose**: End on positive note and confirm next steps

1. **Summarize**:
   - Recap key insights
   - Confirm action items and owners
   - Appreciate participation and candor

2. **Retro the retro**:
   - Quick feedback: "On scale of 1-5, how useful was this retro?"
   - What worked well about this format?
   - What would improve future retros?

3. **Appreciations**:
   - Invite team to appreciate each other
   - Recognize contributions and efforts
   - End on positive, forward-looking note

**Output**: 1-3 concrete action items with owners and due dates.

### Workflow 3: Follow Up on Action Items

**During sprint:**
1. Add action items to sprint backlog
2. Track in standup or project board
3. Check progress mid-sprint
4. Remove blockers if action items stuck

**At next retro:**
1. Review previous action items first
2. Celebrate completed items
3. Discuss why any items weren't completed
4. Decide: continue, discard, or modify incomplete items

**Monthly:**
1. Review trend of action items completed vs. created
2. Assess if improvements are having impact
3. Adjust retro approach if low completion rate

### Workflow 4: Handle Difficult Situations

**Conflict or tension emerges:**
- Acknowledge the emotion
- Remind team of retro norms
- Refocus on learning, not blame
- Park heated topics for separate discussion

**Team is silent or disengaged:**
- Check in: "What's going on?"
- Try different activity (e.g., timeline, drawing)
- Make it safe: share your own observation first
- Consider anonymous submission

**Same issues appear every retro:**
- Acknowledge the pattern explicitly
- Deeper root cause analysis
- Escalate to management if team can't resolve
- Question if previous action items were right approach

**Blame or finger-pointing:**
- Reframe to system/process issue
- "What conditions allowed this to happen?"
- Shift focus to future: "How can we prevent this?"

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command/Trigger |
|--------|-----------------|
| Run retrospective | "facilitate retrospective" |
| Choose format | "suggest retro format" |
| Review action items | "check retro action items" |
| Retro template | "create retro board for [format]" |
| Handle conflict | "retro facilitation help" |

## Best Practices

- **Vary the format**: Don't use same format every time; keeps it fresh and surfaces different insights
- **Psychological safety first**: Without safety, you get polite agreement not honest feedback
- **Time-box strictly**: Respect people's time; focused 60 min better than rambling 90 min
- **Review previous actions**: If action items never get done, why create more?
- **1-3 improvements max**: Can't fix everything; focus creates momentum
- **Make it specific**: "Better communication" is vague; "Daily standup by 10 AM" is actionable
- **No skipping**: Regular cadence builds trust and habit; don't skip even if "nothing to discuss"
- **Rotate facilitator**: Different facilitators bring fresh perspective and energy
- **Data not opinions**: Use metrics to ground discussion in reality
- **Focus on learning**: "What did we learn?" not "Who screwed up?"
- **Appreciate the good**: Don't only focus on problems; recognize wins and strengths
- **Follow through**: If action items are never completed, team stops trusting the process

## Retro Formats

### 1. Start/Stop/Continue
**Best for**: General-purpose, works for any team

**Categories**:
- **Start**: What should we start doing?
- **Stop**: What should we stop doing?
- **Continue**: What should we keep doing?

**Facilitator tips**:
- "Continue" often forgotten; actively solicit positive practices
- Look for items in "Start" that directly address items in "Stop"

### 2. Mad/Sad/Glad
**Best for**: High emotion, after difficult sprint

**Categories**:
- **Mad**: What frustrated or angered us?
- **Sad**: What disappointed us?
- **Glad**: What made us happy?

**Facilitator tips**:
- Validates emotions while channeling toward improvement
- Ensure "Glad" gets equal attention; don't only focus on negative

### 3. 4 L's
**Best for**: Learning-focused teams, after new initiative

**Categories**:
- **Liked**: What went well?
- **Learned**: What did we learn?
- **Lacked**: What was missing?
- **Longed For**: What do we wish we had?

**Facilitator tips**:
- "Learned" surfaces insights for knowledge sharing
- "Longed For" uncovers team needs and aspirations

### 4. Sailboat
**Best for**: Strategic thinking, longer-term planning

**Categories**:
- **Island**: Our goal
- **Wind**: What's helping us move forward?
- **Anchor**: What's holding us back?
- **Rocks**: What risks are ahead?

**Facilitator tips**:
- Start with Island (shared goal) for alignment
- Visual metaphor helps creative thinking

### 5. Speed Car
**Best for**: Team moving fast but maybe recklessly

**Categories**:
- **Engine**: What's driving us forward?
- **Parachute**: What's slowing us down?
- **Bridge**: What's helping us move forward?
- **Wall**: What obstacles are in our way?

**Facilitator tips**:
- Highlights both accelerators and decelerators
- Good for discussing pace and sustainability

### 6. Plus/Delta
**Best for**: Simple, quick retros

**Categories**:
- **Plus (+)**: What went well?
- **Delta (Δ)**: What should we change?

**Facilitator tips**:
- Fast and straightforward
- Use when time is limited
- Delta is less negative-sounding than "minus"

### 7. Timeline
**Best for**: After major event, incident, or complex sprint

**Process**:
1. Draw timeline of sprint/event
2. Each person adds significant moments
3. Identify patterns and turning points
4. Discuss what to learn and change

**Facilitator tips**:
- Helps reconstruct complex situations
- Reveals different perspectives on same events

### 8. Hot Air Balloon
**Best for**: New teams or after major changes

**Categories**:
- **Hot Air**: What lifts us up? (strengths, opportunities)
- **Sandbags**: What weighs us down? (challenges, obstacles)
- **Storm Clouds**: What external threats exist?
- **Clear Skies**: What opportunities lie ahead?

**Facilitator tips**:
- Good for team building and shared vision
- Balances internal and external factors

## 5 Whys Technique

**Use for root cause analysis:**

1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why did this happen?" → Answer
3. Ask "Why did [answer] happen?" → Answer
4. Repeat 3-5 times until root cause emerges
5. Create action item addressing root cause

**Example**:
- Problem: Tests failed in production
- Why? → Code wasn't tested in staging
- Why? → Staging environment was down
- Why? → No monitoring to detect outage
- Why? → We haven't prioritized infrastructure monitoring
- **Action**: Implement infrastructure monitoring and alerts

## Action Item Template

```markdown
**Improvement**: [Brief description]

**Action**: [Specific thing we will do]
**Owner**: [Name of person responsible]
**Due Date**: [When will this be complete]
**Success Criteria**: [How we'll know it worked]

**Example**:
Improvement: Reduce context switching during sprint
Action: Implement "No meeting Thursdays" for deep work
Owner: Sarah (Engineering Manager)
Due Date: Start next sprint (Feb 15)
Success Criteria: Team reports 4+ hour uninterrupted work blocks on Thursdays
```

## Facilitation Anti-Patterns

**Avoid these common mistakes:**

- **Facilitator dominating**: Your job is to guide, not provide all answers
- **Skipping action items**: Retro without actions is just venting
- **No follow-up**: If actions never reviewed, team stops trying
- **Same format every time**: Becomes stale and predictable
- **Letting discussions run over**: Time-boxing shows respect
- **Not addressing elephants**: Ignoring obvious issues kills trust
- **Making it personal**: Focus on systems and processes, not people
- **Too many actions**: 1-3 is realistic; 10 is overwhelming
- **Vague improvements**: "Communicate better" isn't actionable
- **Skipping when busy**: "No time for retro" signals improvement isn't valued

## Psychological Safety Checklist

Before and during retro, ensure:
- [ ] Team knows feedback is confidential
- [ ] All voices are heard equally
- [ ] Disagreement is welcome and safe
- [ ] Blame and judgment are absent
- [ ] Failures are treated as learning opportunities
- [ ] Leadership models vulnerability and openness
- [ ] Retaliating for honesty has consequences
- [ ] Anonymous input is option if needed

## Integration Points

- **Sprint Planner**: Schedule retro at end of every sprint
- **Task Manager**: Track retro action items as tasks
- **Project Planner**: Feed learnings into future planning
- **Team Metrics**: Use data to inform discussion
- **Knowledge Base**: Document key learnings and patterns
- **Continuous Improvement**: Trends across retros inform process changes
