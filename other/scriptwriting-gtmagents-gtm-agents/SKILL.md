# Video Scriptwriting Systems Skill

## When to Use
- Developing scripts for explainer, testimonial, thought leadership, or product videos.
- Aligning scripts with positioning, CTA, and voice/tone guidelines.
- Iterating on scripts based on feedback or performance data.

## Framework
1. **Hook** – capture attention in first 5 seconds (question, stat, bold claim).
2. **Problem/Insight** – relate to audience pain or opportunity.
3. **Solution Story** – product capability or narrative proof with visuals.
4. **Proof** – customer quote, metric, analyst validation.
5. **CTA** – single next step (demo, trial, download, subscribe).

## Templates
- Script template with columns for VO/dialogue, visuals, motion notes, duration.
- Storyboard grid with frame, description, audio, graphics, CTA.
- Tone/voice checklist (personality traits, jargon allowances, compliance notes).

## Tips
- Write for ear: short sentences, contractions, conversational tone.
- Add direction for B-roll, overlays, animations, and text callouts.
- Plan variant clips (15s teaser, 6s bumper, square stories) from the start.
