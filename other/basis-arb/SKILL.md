description: Use when the user asks for spot-perp basis trade, basis arbitrage, cash-and-carry, perp discount, or any setup that reads the spot–perp basis as a positioning signal. Long-perp leg only — pure two-leg basis arb requires a paired spot short (or long) which Freqtrade can't run cleanly. The strategy below captures the directional read, not the hedged carry.

# Strategy: Basis Flipping — Directional (Long-Perp Leg)

## Honest framing — read this first

**True basis arbitrage** is a two-leg trade:

- Long perp + short spot (when perp trades at a discount to spot, basis < 0)
- Short perp + long spot (when perp trades at a premium, basis > 0)

You earn the basis as the legs converge. **Freqtrade is a single-leg engine** — it can't run paired hedged trades on the same ticker. The strategy below captures the **directional signal** that "basis flipping negative + funding negative = bullish positioning shift" and goes long the perp accordingly. It's a momentum read on positioning, not a hedged arb.

If you want the actual hedged version, run an external system (or a custom Hyperliquid-only multi-leg runtime). Don't deploy this template thinking it's market-neutral.

## Backtest reference

| Window | `BTC/USDC:USDC` 1h, 2026-01-01 → 2026-05-01 |
|---|---|
| Trades | **0** (no spot leg available in the engine) |
| Backtest ID | `01kr42hegps9w20njsty2cqb41` |

The Superior Trade backtest engine doesn't currently expose Hyperliquid spot OHLCV alongside perp pairs via Freqtrade's `informative_pairs` mechanism, so the `spot_close` column is never populated and the entry filter never fires. The strategy code is structurally sound — it runs cleanly to completion with 0 trades — but **this template can't be validated end-to-end on the current backtest engine**. Two paths:

1. **Validate live, paper-traded** — run as a dry-run deployment for a week and compare the entries against an external basis tracker (CoinGlass `basisHistory` or a simple notebook).
2. **Substitute external basis feed** — replace the `informative_pairs` spot fetch with a CoinGlass `/api/futures/basis/history` call from a side-channel cache. Out of scope for this template; would be a Phase 2 backend change.

The strategy is shipped as a **directional blueprint**, not a live-validated runtime. Treat it as a teachable template for how to wire spot-perp basis into a Freqtrade strategy, rather than an off-the-shelf deployment.

## When to use

A user asks for:
- "Basis trade", "basis arb", "perp discount", "cash and carry"
- A directional follow-on to spot-side accumulation ("spot is buying, perp is short, going long the perp")
- Anything where the basis flipping negative is the trigger

This template **assumes Hyperliquid has both the spot and perp pair** for the asset (BTC, ETH, SOL — the few HL has spot books for). For perp-only assets, this strategy can't compute basis and won't fire.

## The Freqtrade primitive that makes this work

Two `dp.get_pair_dataframe` calls:
1. The current perp's funding rate (same pattern as `strategy-funding-rate-arbitrage`)
2. The corresponding **spot** pair's OHLCV via `informative_pairs()` so we can compute basis

Basis = `(perp_mark - spot_mid) / spot_mid`. Annualised by funding period.

## Config requirements

```json
{
  "exchange": { "name": "hyperliquid", "pair_whitelist": ["BTC/USDC:USDC"] },
  "stake_currency": "USDC",
  "stake_amount": 100,
  "timeframe": "1h",
  "max_open_trades": 1,
  "stoploss": -0.04,
  "minimal_roi": { "0": 100.0 },
  "trading_mode": "futures",
  "margin_mode": "cross",
  "entry_pricing": { "price_side": "same" },
  "exit_pricing": { "price_side": "same" },
  "pairlists": [{ "method": "StaticPairList" }]
}
```

**Pair must have a corresponding HL spot pair**. Today that's effectively BTC, ETH, SOL, HYPE — the few assets with both perp and spot books on Hyperliquid. Other perps will return zero basis and never fire.

## Tunable parameters

| Knob | Effect |
|---|---|
| `basis_apr < -0.05` | Stricter (`-0.10`) → only deeper discounts. Looser (`-0.02`) → more entries, weaker signal. |
| `funding_apr < 0.0` | The "shorts paying" confirmation. Drop this to fire on basis alone (faster, noisier). |
| `spot_close > sma_24` | The "spot isn't crashing" filter. Without it, the strategy buys into spot drawdowns where the basis is negative because everything's down. |
| `timeout_48h` | Basis trades take days, not hours. Don't tighten below 24h. |

## Variants

- **Hedged via external runtime**: pair this with a spot-short (e.g. through Aerodrome or a CEX) for true delta-neutral. Out of scope for Freqtrade.
- **Reverse premium** (variant): when basis > +0.10 APR with positive funding, short the perp. Mirror logic, requires `can_short = True` and an isolated-margin perp config.
- **Term-structure variant**: skip same-pair basis and use the 1d-MA basis vs 1h basis as the signal. Less noisy, more reliable for swing horizon.

## Common pitfalls

1. **Treating this as market-neutral.** It isn't. The price exposure is full perp delta. The basis convergence is an *additional* edge on top of that exposure, not a substitute for it.
2. **Pairs without spot.** Perp-only HL pairs (most alts) won't have basis data — the strategy will never fire and the user gets confused why "no trades". Always confirm `informative_pairs` declared the spot leg.
3. **Hourly basis noise.** Basis at the 1h scale flickers around zero. Without the funding-confirming filter, you get whipsawed by every tick of perp-spot divergence.
4. **Tight stops.** Convergence trades take days, not hours. `-0.04` is the floor; tighter and ATR noise stops you out before the trade works.
