# new-hook

Trigger: user asks to create a custom React hook.

## Workflow

1. Confirm: name (use\*), params, return type.
2. Run from the repo root: `./.gaia/cli/gaia scaffold hook <useFoo> [--params "a:string,b:number"] [--returns "ReturnType"]`.
3. Verify: `pnpm typecheck` clean. Open and sanity-check.
