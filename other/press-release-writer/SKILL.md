### Step 2: Gather Key Information

**The 5 W's + H checklist:**

```markdown
## Press Release Brief

**What:** [The announcement - what happened/is happening]
**Who:** [Company, people, partners involved]
**When:** [Date, time, timeline]
**Where:** [Location, markets, availability]
**Why:** [Significance, reason, benefit]
**How:** [Process, next steps, how to access]

**Newsworthiness:**

- [ ] First/only in industry
- [ ] Significant milestone
- [ ] Notable partnership/person
- [ ] Trend/timing relevance
- [ ] Impact on customers/industry

**Supporting Assets:**

- [ ] Executive quote
- [ ] Partner/customer quote
- [ ] Statistics/data points
- [ ] Images/video available
- [ ] Fact sheet/backgrounder
```

### Step 3: Headline Writing

**Headline formula:**

```
[Company] + [Action Verb] + [What] + [Benefit/Impact]
```

**Headline examples by type:**

| Type        | Example                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product     | "Acme Launches AI-Powered Analytics Platform to Help SMBs Make Data-Driven Decisions" |
| Funding     | "TechStart Raises $25M Series B to Accelerate Global Expansion"                       |
| Partnership | "Acme Partners with Microsoft to Bring Enterprise Solutions to Azure Marketplace"     |
| Award       | "Acme Named to Forbes Cloud 100 for Third Consecutive Year"                           |
| Research    | "New Study Reveals 78% of Marketers Plan to Increase AI Investment in 2026"           |
| Acquisition | "Acme Acquires DataCorp to Strengthen Machine Learning Capabilities"                  |

**Headline rules:**

| Do                       | Don't                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Use active voice         | Use passive voice      |
| Include company name     | Start with date        |
| State the news clearly   | Be vague or teasing    |
| Keep under 80 characters | Use all caps           |
| Use strong action verbs  | Use "announces" (weak) |

**Subheadline (optional):**

Add context or secondary benefit:

```
[Primary Headline]
[Supporting detail, additional context, or key statistic]
```

### Step 4: Press Release Structure

**Inverted pyramid format:**

```markdown
# [HEADLINE]

## [Subheadline - optional]

**[CITY, State] – [Month Day, Year]** – [Lead paragraph: Who did what,
when, where, and why it matters. Most important information first.
Should be able to stand alone as the entire story. 25-30 words.]

[Second paragraph: Expand on the lead. Add context, statistics, or
the "how." Support the newsworthiness claim.]

[Quote from company executive: Provide perspective, vision, or
significance. Make it sound human, not corporate.]

[Third/fourth paragraph: Additional details, features, availability,
or technical information. Less critical info here.]

[Quote from partner, customer, or analyst - optional: Third-party
validation adds credibility.]

[Final paragraph: Call to action, availability, where to learn more.]

### About [Company Name]

[Boilerplate: 2-3 sentences describing the company, what it does,
key stats, and website.]

### Media Contact

[Name]
[Title]
[Company]
[Email]
[Phone]

###
```

### Step 5: Lead Paragraph

**Lead paragraph template:**

```markdown
**[City, State] – [Month Day, Year]** – [Company Name], [brief descriptor],
today announced [the news], [key benefit or impact]. [Supporting detail
or availability information].
```

**Lead examples:**

**Product Launch:**

> business analytics, today launched DataPro 3.0, an AI-powered platform
> that reduces reporting time by 80%. The new version is available
> immediately for all enterprise customers.

**Funding:**

> of developer tools, today announced it has raised $25 million in
> Series B funding led by Sequoia Capital. The investment will accelerate
> product development and international expansion.

> announced a strategic partnership to deliver integrated supply chain
> solutions to enterprise customers worldwide. The collaboration combines
> Acme's logistics platform with GlobalTech's AI forecasting technology.

### Step 6: Quote Guidelines

**Executive quote formula:**

```markdown
"[Statement about significance/vision], [Company Name] + [action/commitment].
[Forward-looking statement or customer benefit]," said [Name], [Title]
at [Company].
```

**Quote examples:**

**Visionary:**

**Partnership:**

> build alone," said Sarah Johnson, CEO of GlobalTech. "Together, we're
> setting a new standard for supply chain intelligence."

**Quote rules:**

| Do                             | Don't                         |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Sound like a human speaking    | Use corporate jargon          |
| Add perspective not in text    | Repeat the headline           |
| Include forward-looking vision | Be generic or bland           |
| Keep to 2-3 sentences          | Write paragraph-length quotes |

### Step 7: Body Paragraphs
