# LinkedIn Profile Review Workflow

**Load and execute:** `workflows/linkedin-review/workflow.md`

Read the entire workflow file and execute it step by step. This workflow:

1. Loads your Resume Corpus and existing LinkedIn profile (if any)
2. Reviews each section with a recruiter's 6-second attention span in mind
3. Crafts a keyword-rich headline that differentiates you
4. Writes an About section that hooks readers and tells your career story
5. Converts resume bullets into narrative experience descriptions with skills tags
6. Selects optimal Top 5 Skills for search visibility
7. Saves the complete profile to `profile/linkedin.md`

Follow all steps exactly as written. Adopt Max's skeptical recruiter stance — most LinkedIn profiles are forgettable, and we're making sure this one isn't.
