Use this skill when automation needs to run on a recurring cadence rather than directly from a record event. Schedule-triggered flows work well for bounded recurring tasks such as reminders, renewals, or cleanup logic. They become risky when teams treat them like a general-purpose batch engine and let the record scope or side effects grow without discipline.

The three most common failure modes of scheduled flows in production: (1) unbounded start filter that touches half the org's records on every run, (2) missing idempotency so the same records get "reminded" on every nightly run, (3) silent failure because nobody is monitoring the schedule-trigger error queue. This skill exists to prevent all three — and to know when to stop and use Batch Apex instead.

## Before Starting

Check for `salesforce-context.md` in the project root. If present, read it first.

Gather if not available:
- What recurrence is required, and is the automation tied to a business calendar or to a record event that might fit a scheduled path better?
- How many records could match the criteria on a normal day, and what is the worst-case volume during seasonal or data-load spikes?
- How will the flow avoid duplicate work if it runs again, partially fails, or overlaps with another automation?
- What is the expected runtime budget (each scheduled-flow invocation must finish within async limits)?
- Who owns the error-email recipient for this schedule? What's the SLA on response?

## Core Concepts

The core design problem in scheduled flows is not the schedule itself. It is **bounded scope** plus **repeat-safe behavior**. A recurring automation that cannot explain which records it will touch, why it will touch them only once when appropriate, and when it should escalate out of Flow is not ready for production.

### Choose The Right Time Primitive

Three options; only one is a schedule-triggered flow:

| Primitive | When to use | When NOT |
|---|---|---|
| **Schedule-triggered flow** | Periodic scan of records matching time-based criteria independently of save events (nightly lease-renewal reminders, quarterly data cleanup) | When triggered from a record event — use scheduled path instead |
| **Scheduled Path on record-triggered flow** | Record event → wait N days → do work (send follow-up email 14d after Case created) | When there's no triggering record — schedule-triggered is the answer |
| **Batch Apex scheduled via System.schedule** | High-volume periodic processing, complex joins, large record sets | When the workload truly fits Flow's model (small set, simple operations, admin-maintainable) |

A wrong primitive choice is the most common scheduled-flow design error. If the requirement starts "when a record is X and Y days old", it's likely a scheduled path, not a schedule-triggered flow.

### Two Execution Modes: With Or Without An Object

The object in the Start element is **optional**, and that single choice changes the flow's entire execution model. Decide it before you draw anything else.

| | **Object selected** (+ criteria) | **No object selected** |
|---|---|---|
| What runs | The platform queries matching records and creates **one interview per record** | A single interview, once per scheduled run |
| `$Record` | Available — the flow's logic operates on one record | Not available |
| Batching | Interviews run in batches (default 200, settable 1–200 in the Start element) | N/A — one interview |
| Get + Loop over the same object | **Anti-pattern** — the platform already iterates for you | Correct and expected |

Trailhead states it directly: "When the flow runs, it finds all of that object's records that match the criteria, and makes them available through `$Record`," and "If you don't set an object and criteria, `$Record` isn't available." Trailhead also notes `$Record` "actually refers to multiple records" — meaning it spans the whole matching set *across* interviews; within any single interview it resolves to exactly one record, which is why you author for one.

The consequence most builders miss: **when an object is selected, you author the flow as if it handles exactly one record.** Adding a Get Records + Loop over that same object re-fetches the whole set inside every interview — N interviews × N iterations instead of N. The record scope belongs in the Start element's criteria, not in a Loop.

Conversely, an object-less schedule-triggered flow is just a scheduled job. There is no `$Record` and nothing iterates for you, so Get Records + Loop (or Transform / Collection Filter / Collection Sort) is the correct shape — a loop at the top of *this* mode is not an anti-pattern.

### Bounded Selection Comes First

The start criteria should narrow the job to a realistic set of records. Wide-open scans with complex branching downstream create both performance risk and support ambiguity. Good scheduled flows have clear filters, explicit stop conditions, and a manageable result set per run (< 250 records per run is a good rule of thumb for pure-Flow execution).

Concrete selection criteria should combine:
- **Type/status filter** — `Status = 'Open' AND RecordType = 'Support'`.
- **Time-window filter** — `LastModifiedDate < TODAY - 30` or `CreatedDate = THIS_MONTH`.
- **Processing marker** — `Last_Reminded_Date__c != TODAY` (see idempotency below).

Filters that rely on computed fields or formula predicates WILL slow the scheduled query. Prefer indexed fields + date ranges + processing flags.

### Idempotency Matters In Recurring Automation

A recurring flow should be able to answer: "has this record already been processed for this job window?" Without idempotency, the same records get reminded, updated, or emailed every run — a frequent source of "the system spammed our customers" incidents.

Idempotency patterns:

| Pattern | Implementation | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| Processing flag | `Processed_Today__c = true` set at end of processing; reset nightly | Simple; requires a reset job |
| Last-processed date | `Last_Processed_At__c = <timestamp>`; filter on `Last_Processed_At__c < TODAY` | No reset needed; field can stale |
| Status transition | Move record to a terminal status that the filter excludes | Cleanest; requires business-meaningful status |
| External lock | Write to a custom "job log" object; check before processing | Most robust; highest overhead |

### Flow Is Not Always The Final Execution Engine

When the recurring job becomes large (> 500 records per run), computationally heavy (complex joins or multi-step transformations), or deeply iterative (nested loops with DML), the right answer may be to use the scheduled flow only as a lightweight orchestration layer or move the workload into Batch Apex entirely. The schedule does not justify using the wrong execution model.

**Signals Flow is no longer the right engine:**
- Record count per run > 500.
- CPU time approaches the async limit (60s sync / still constrained async).
- The Flow has > 5 DML operations in a loop.
- The job needs to run more than daily to stay current.
- Apex invocables are doing most of the real work (then just make it Batch Apex).

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Narrow Nightly Follow-Up Flow

**When to use:** Recurring reminder or status update on a bounded slice of records.

**Structure** (object-selected mode — the platform iterates, so author for ONE record):
```text
Start: Daily at 2am
  Object: Case
  Criteria: Status = 'Pending' AND CreatedDate < TODAY - 7 AND Last_Reminded_Date__c != TODAY
Plan (runs once per matching record, $Record is that record):
  └── [Send Custom Notification OR Email Alert]  → addressed from $Record
  └── [Update Records: $Record.Last_Reminded_Date__c = TODAY]
  └── [Fault path: log + notify admin]
```

No Get Records. No Loop. The Start element's criteria *are* the record selection; adding a Get + Loop here would re-query every matching Case inside every interview.

**Object-less variant:** if you leave the object blank (say, to build a daily digest across several objects), the flow runs as one interview and you *do* need Get Records + Loop — plus an explicit `LIMIT` and a bulk Update after the loop, since nothing bounds the set for you.

**Why not the alternative:** A broad nightly sweep without clear selection becomes unpredictable and expensive.

### Pattern 2: Scheduled Flow As Lightweight Orchestrator

**When to use:** The timing belongs in Flow, but the heavy work belongs elsewhere.

**Structure:**
```text
Schedule: Weekly on Monday 3am
Plan:
  └── [Get Records: this week's candidates (narrow filter)]
  └── [Decision: record_count > threshold?]
       └── Yes → [Invocable Apex: kick off Batch Apex job with candidate IDs]
       └── No  → [Process inline via Loop + subflow]
```

Flow owns the timing and the "is this worth running today" check. Apex owns the work.

### Pattern 3: Replace Time-Based Workflow With Explicit Criteria

**When to use:** Legacy time-based Workflow Rule being migrated to Flow.

**Structure:** The Workflow Rule's "Evaluate every time a record is created or edited" + time-based action becomes a record-triggered flow's Scheduled Path (NOT a schedule-triggered flow) — because the behavior is record-event-driven, not portfolio-scan-driven.

For ACTUAL portfolio-scan automation being migrated from custom Apex scheduled jobs: evaluate whether it's really Flow-shaped first. Many scheduled Apex jobs exist because there was no good Flow primitive; now that scheduled flows + scheduled paths exist, some can migrate, but not all.

### Pattern 4: Run Log + Monitoring

**When to use:** Any production scheduled flow — this is not optional.

**Structure:**
```text
Start of run → [Create Records: Scheduled_Flow_Run__c with start_time + run_id]
... main work ...
End of run → [Update Records: the same log record with end_time + record_count + status]
Fault path → [Update Records: log record with status='failed' + fault_message]
```

A Scheduled_Flow_Run__c object (or equivalent) gives operations:
- **Run history** — did the 3am job actually run last night?
- **Duration trends** — is the nightly job taking longer over time?
- **Failure visibility** — alert when `status='failed'` appears without alerting on every successful run.

## Decision Guidance

| Situation | Recommended Approach | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Recurring job scans a bounded set of records daily or weekly | Schedule-triggered flow (Pattern 1) | Good fit for predictable recurring automation |
| Follow-up tied to a specific record save event | Scheduled path on record-triggered flow | Event-based, not portfolio-wide |
| Job volume or processing complexity high | Batch Apex or async code boundary | Flow is not the best execution engine for heavy batch work |
| Repeated reminders need duplicate prevention | Add idempotent markers or date fields | Recurring runs must know what's already processed |
| Selection criteria vague or unbounded | Redesign before scheduling | Schedule will amplify poor scope decisions |
| Job needs to run multiple times per day | Consider sub-hourly schedule (flow limits) or move to Batch Apex | Flow scheduling granularity may not fit |
| Requires external callout per record | HTTP Action inline for small sets; async via Platform Events for large | Per-record callouts exhaust callout limits |

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Schedule primitive is correct (scheduled flow vs scheduled path vs Batch Apex).
- [ ] Start criteria narrow the candidate record set intentionally (no bare `Active=true`).
- [ ] Idempotent markers prevent duplicate tasks, emails, or updates across runs.
- [ ] Failure handling exists for every DML element (Pattern A from `flow/fault-handling`).
- [ ] Volume expectations were reviewed for normal and worst-case runs.
- [ ] Heavy work was escalated out of Flow when appropriate.
- [ ] Run log exists (custom object or equivalent) for operational monitoring.
- [ ] Error-email recipient is a monitored mailbox, not a single inactive admin.

## Salesforce-Specific Gotchas

1. **A recurring schedule amplifies weak selection logic** — broad filters turn into repeated large jobs quickly.
2. **Recurring automation needs duplicate prevention explicitly** — without markers, the same records can be processed on every run.
3. **Scheduled flows are not a substitute for true batch architecture** — the timing may fit, while the execution model does not.
4. **A record-event requirement may fit scheduled paths better** — choosing the wrong time primitive creates unnecessary complexity.
5. **Scheduled-flow errors email the Process Automation user**, same as record-triggered flows. Verify the recipient is monitored annually.
6. **Scheduled flows DO NOT retry automatically on failure** — a failed run just... doesn't run. The next scheduled run tries fresh. Build retry logic into the flow if the business needs it.
7. **Two schedules overlapping can compete for records** — if two scheduled flows both filter "Status = Open", run one, the records transition, then the second flow sees different results than the first. Design mutually-exclusive filters or serialize schedules.
8. **Salesforce limits the number of scheduled jobs per org** — check `AsyncApexJob` + scheduled-flow limits before adding the Nth schedule.
9. **Daily-at-2am is everyone's default** — so everyone's org hits Salesforce's scheduler peak load at 2am. Spread actual scheduled times to avoid platform contention.
10. **Scheduled flows can't be paused mid-run** — once started, they run to completion or failure. Design the scope accordingly.

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these WITHOUT being asked:

- **Scheduled flow with no idempotency marker** → Flag as Critical. Will double-process on retry or next run.
- **Scheduled flow with unbounded start criteria (e.g. "Active = true" alone)** → Flag as Critical. Volume bomb waiting to happen.
- **Record-event requirement being built as scheduled flow instead of scheduled path** → Flag as High. Wrong primitive.
- **Scheduled flow > 500 records per run with no escalation plan** → Flag as High. Probably needs Batch Apex.
- **No run log / monitoring surface for production scheduled flow** → Flag as High. Silent failure invitation.
- **Multiple scheduled flows on same object with overlapping filters** → Flag as Medium. Coordination risk.
- **Scheduled flow error email recipient is inactive** → Flag as Critical. Unseen failure pattern.
- **All scheduled flows set for 2am** → Flag as Low. Platform-peer peak-load contention; spread schedules.
