# Interceptor iOS

Agent-operator skill for the iOS surface of Interceptor. Use the `interceptor ios *` CLI to drive **any installed app on an owned, unlocked, Developer-Mode iPhone**: ref-tagged accessibility trees, deterministic coordinate taps, reliable text entry, scroll/drag, hardware buttons, screenshots, and app lifecycle.

The phone runs Interceptor's own on-device **XCUITest runner** (InterceptorRunner — *not* WebDriverAgent). The runner **dials into the daemon** over a WebSocket, exactly like the browser extension; the daemon drives it from there. Once the phone is paired over WiFi, no cable is needed. For content inside a browser tab load `interceptor-browser`; for a macOS app load `interceptor-macos`.

This installed skill is self-contained. Source checkouts also have `AGENTS.md`, but packaged users may only have the skill directory below `/Library/Application Support/Interceptor/skills`.

## Fast Path

```bash
interceptor ios devices                        # 1. Phones with the agent installed (+ aliases)
interceptor ios status                          # 2. Per-phone connection state
interceptor ios tree --on phone                 # 3. Auto-connects, returns the ref-tagged element tree
interceptor ios find --label "Slack" --on phone # 4. Locate an element by label/role
interceptor ios click e29 --on phone            # 5. Deterministic coordinate tap at the ref's frame center
interceptor ios type e243 "hello" --on phone    # 6. Focus the field, then type
interceptor ios screenshot --on phone           # 7. Capture the screen (VLM-budget resized)
```

Omit `--on <name>` when only one phone is set up — it's used by default. Set an alias once with `interceptor ios name <udid> phone`, then always use `--on phone`.

Treat `eN` refs as short-lived. The UI changes between calls; **re-read with `interceptor ios tree` before acting**. Refs carry frames and resolve to coordinates, so a tap is deterministic even if the underlying element handle went stale.

Apps with no usable tree (games, canvases): `click`, `drag`, and `scroll` also take screen points, `drag X,Y X,Y --duration 2` is a long press, and `interceptor macos vision text --image <screenshot>` reads the screen. For a loop that needs a fresh look every few hundred milliseconds, `ios stream start --out <path>` has the runner push JPEG frames over Wi-Fi and rewrite that one file, and `ios gesture` presses with several fingers at once (a held pedal plus a tapped arrow). The recipes and the box-to-point conversion are in the [command catalog](references/command-catalog.md).

## The Model

- **The device dials in.** Ordinary runner verbs auto-launch on an unlocked phone and connect back over the network. The daemon hands the runner a VPN (Tailscale) address when the Mac has one, because iOS silently denies a backgrounded runner's LAN connection until the user has granted it Local Network access (Settings › Privacy & Security › Local Network), and a VPN address is exempt from that check; `interceptor ios status` shows the address as `dialBack` / `dialBackVia`. Put the phone on the same VPN, or grant that switch once and LAN dial-back works too. Unlock and its probe require an already connected resident runner and do not auto-launch.
- **Unlocked + foreground matters.** A locked phone refuses app launches. While the runner is connected and resident, `interceptor ios unlock --secret ios-passcode` attempts vault-backed passcode entry; success requires an observed unlocked state. `ios unlock --probe` checks without typing and can succeed while reporting `locked: true`. Both commands fail immediately when disconnected, without trying to launch XCTest on a locked phone. Unlock once and run `ios tree` to connect the runner first. Keep Auto-Lock off while working.
- **Passcodes come from the vault, never from chat.** Nothing can fake Face ID or Apple Pay. On a Face ID sheet tap "Enter Passcode", then `interceptor ios type <ref> --secret ios-passcode` (or `ios keys --secret ios-passcode`); the runner types into SpringBoard when the sheet owns the keyboard. Register the passcode once with `interceptor macos secret register ios-passcode --target ios`.
- **The XCTest authorization sheet is a human gate. Stop and ask.** The first XCUITest launch after a reboot, and any later re-authorization, shows *"Enter iPhone Passcode for XCTest — Enable UI Automation"* on the phone; a runner verb then fails with `Not authorized for performing UI testing actions` or times out on `XCTestManager_IDEInterface`. Nothing on the Mac can enter it: the runner is the process it blocks, so `ios unlock` and `keys --secret` cannot help; AccessibilityAudit and Accessibility Inspector can read the sheet but every action on it reports unsupported and leaves the field at 0 of 6; Switch Control cannot target a digit; iPhone Mirroring does not forward keystrokes to it; re-signing Apple's tools strips the private entitlements they need. When you see the sheet, report it and ask for the passcode to be tapped on the phone (or typed by a paired hardware keyboard), then restart the daemon and retry. Do not spend time on accessibility, Switch Control, Mirroring, or re-signing routes.
- **Setup uses Xcode.** `interceptor ios setup` builds, signs, installs, and launches a team-scoped runner using the Apple Developer team configured in Xcode. `interceptor ios login` is unavailable and fails before password input. A background timer reruns Xcode setup before the certificate expires. Once registered, the runner stays resident for the XCUITest session; later verbs reuse it without a 30-second lease or relaunch.

## Workflows

| Workflow | When to invoke |
|---|---|
| [`workflows/drive-iphone-app.md`](workflows/drive-iphone-app.md) | Open an app and complete a task on a real iPhone: launch → tree → find → click/type → verify |

## When To Switch Surfaces

- Target is **content inside a browser tab** (DOM, network, SPA state) → load `interceptor-browser`.
- Target is a **native macOS app** (or the browser chrome / OS dialogs on the Mac) → load `interceptor-macos`.
- Target is an **app on the physical iPhone** → this skill.

## Do Not Default To Troubleshooting

- User wants an iPhone task completed → run `interceptor ios *` commands.
- User wants Interceptor's iOS support fixed, installed, or explained → that's a separate task; ask before diving into repo state.
- Inside the Interceptor repo, use this skill for live device validation, not as the primary source of repo-development instructions.
