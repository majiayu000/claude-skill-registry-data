# Watcher architect

The user says when they want to be told something. You turn that sentence into a rule
tree, once. The watcher then evaluates it mechanically at every poll, for free, forever.

Use this whenever someone asks to be warned, notified, or to have something run WHEN a
condition becomes true: a file appears or vanishes, a service goes down or comes back, a
page changes, a log line matches, on certain days, within certain hours, after a certain
delay.

Never express days, hours, durations or patterns in the legacy `condition` text field.
That field wakes a model on every single event. The `regles` tree costs nothing.

## The three traps, first, because they are what goes wrong

**1. The op must match `watcher_type`, or it is false at every poll.**

| watcher_type | What it observes | Ops it can satisfy |
|---|---|---|
| `log` | new lines appended to a growing file | `contient`, `contenu_change` |
| `file` | the lifecycle AND presence of a path. Carries NO text. | `apparu`, `supprime`, `modifie`, `existe`, `absent`, `taille_depasse_mo` |
| `url` | reachability and page text | `est_down`, `down_depuis_min`, `retour_en_ligne`, `status_http`, `contient`, `contenu_change` |
| `command` | the OUTPUT and exit code of a shell command, re-run at every poll | `contient`, `contenu_change`, `code_retour` |

"Tell me when a line of app.log contains ERROR" is a **log** watcher. Written as `file`,
`contient` reads an observation that carries no text, so it is false forever and the
watcher never fires while reporting itself as active.

**2. `heure_entre` bounds are STRINGS and the end is EXCLUSIVE.**
`a: "23:00"` stops at 22:59. To cover 23:55, write `a: "23:56"`. `"22:00"` is the
canonical form; a bare `"22"` and `"8h30"` are accepted too.

**3. `apparu` means "the file appeared", not "a new line appeared".**
On a log watcher, new lines are what `contient` reads. Combining `apparu` with a log
watcher yields a rule that can never be true.

## The tree

One JSON object tagged by `op`, nesting through `regles` arrays.

Combinators: `et {regles: [...]}`, `ou {regles: [...]}`, `non {regle: {...}}`.
The child array is named `regles`. Not `clauses`, not `conditions`.

Deterministic leaves, evaluated at every poll at zero cost:

| op | arguments | true when |
|---|---|---|
| `jour_semaine` | `jours: ["mar","jeu"]` (fr or en, short or full) | today is one of them |
| `heure_entre` | `de: "08:00", a: "22:00"` (overnight windows work) | local time is inside, end excluded |
| `plage_date` | `du: "2026-07-01", au: "2026-07-31"` | local date is inside, both included |
| `apparu` / `supprime` / `modifie` | none | the watched FILE appeared, was deleted, changed |
| `existe` / `absent` | none | the path IS there right now, or is not |
| `contenu_change` | none | the page text or the log gained content |
| `est_down` | none | the URL is unreachable or answers 5xx |
| `down_depuis_min` | `minutes: 10` | it has been down for at least that long |
| `retour_en_ligne` | none | the URL just came back |
| `contient` | `motif: "ERROR"` | fresh content contains it, case-insensitive |
| `taille_depasse_mo` | `mo: 100` | the watched file reached that size |
| `status_http` | `codes: [500, 503]` | the last status is one of them |
| `code_retour` | `codes: [0]` | the command exited with one of them |
| `nouvelle_ligne` | `motif: "aa:bb"` (optional) | a line appeared that was NOT in the previous poll |

One semantic leaf, the only one that costs a model call, and only after the
deterministic part already passed:

| `llm_check` | `question: "..."` | the gate answers yes |

Put it LAST inside an `et`, so the free leaves filter first.

## Firing

A STATE leaf (`est_down`, `down_depuis_min`, `contient` on a page) stays true while the
situation lasts, so the watcher re-fires every `cooldown_secs` on its own. An EVENT leaf
(`apparu`, `retour_en_ligne`) is true only on the poll where it happens: one fire.

Set `interval_secs` to how fast the user needs to KNOW. Set `cooldown_secs` to how often
they want to be REMINDED.

## Procedure

1. Run `watcher_list`. If one already covers this target, update or delete it rather
   than create a twin. The tool refuses duplicates on the same target.
2. Determine `watcher_type` from what is actually observed, using the table above. Get
   this wrong and nothing else matters.
3. Write the tree. Every mechanical condition goes into a deterministic leaf.
4. Use an ABSOLUTE path for a file or log target. Relative paths resolve against the
   server's working directory, not the user's folder, and the tool refuses them. A
   folder is refused too: it would fire on every unrelated change inside it.
5. Call `watcher_create`. If it answers "Rule accepted by the parser but it can never
   fire", read the reason: the window is unreadable or empty, a pattern is blank, a
   threshold is zero. Fix and retry.
6. Restate the compiled tree to the user in one readable line, so they can confirm the
   logic you inferred.

## Watching something that is not a file, a page or a log

A lamp, a service, a container, free disk space: none of those is a file or a URL, and
they all answer to a CLI. That is the `command` watcher. `target` IS the command, it is
re-run at every poll, and the rules read its output and its exit code.

```json
{"watcher_type":"command","target":"openhue get light \"Hue Play Bureau fab\"",
 "regles":{"op":"contient","motif":"[on]"}}
```

**Reach for this before a cron.** A cron wakes a whole model turn at every tick to look
at something that did not change; a rule tree evaluates for free. The only reason to
schedule a prompt instead is when the ANSWER itself needs a model, not the detection.

The first poll only records a baseline and never fires: otherwise a lamp that was
already on would notify you the moment you asked to be told when it comes on.

Default interval is 60s and default cooldown 900s, because running a process is heavier
than reading a file and because a state that stays true would otherwise notify every
minute. Destructive commands are refused outright: a watcher runs unattended, forever,
so what is merely risky by hand is a standing hazard here.

## Detecting an ARRIVAL, not just a change

`contenu_change` fires when the output differs, which includes something LEAVING. For
any list-shaped output, a device list, running containers, changed files, what is
wanted is the arrival.

```json
{"watcher_type":"command","target":"arp -a",
 "regles":{"op":"nouvelle_ligne"}}
```

Someone connects to the network, you are told. Someone leaves, you are not. The first
poll only records a baseline and announces nothing, otherwise every device already
present would be reported as an arrival the moment the watcher is created.

Lines are compared against the PREVIOUS poll, not against all of history. A phone that
left and came back really is someone arriving again, and remembering every line ever
seen would grow without bound on a chatty command.

## What it DOES when it fires

Three behaviours, and the default is the expensive one. Choose deliberately.

| `action` | Cost | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `{"type":"agent"}` (default) | a full model turn | the message has to be reasoned about, or something must be worked out |
| `{"type":"notifier"}` | nothing | the job is just to tell the user. The observation IS the message |
| `{"type":"commande","commande":"..."}` | nothing | the watcher must ACT: the lamp came on after midnight, turn it off |
| `{"type":"aucune"}` | nothing | it is a pure SENSOR, existing only so another watcher can correlate on it |

`notifier` is right far more often than the default. "Tell me when the file is gone"
needs no thinking: the sentence is known in advance, and a model asked to write it can
also get it wrong.

`commande` is what turns monitoring into automation. It runs through PowerShell on
Windows and `sh` elsewhere, it is bounded by a timeout, and it goes through the same
refusal list as a watched command, which is stricter here because an action mutates by
design.

## Transition or state, the distinction that decides what you can combine

`apparu`, `supprime`, `modifie`, `retour_en_ligne` are TRANSITIONS: true on the single
poll where the thing happened, false again immediately after. `existe`, `absent`,
`est_down`, `contient` are STATES: true for as long as the situation lasts.

A transition can never mean "it is there". So this is wrong:

```json
{"op":"et","regles":[{"op":"apparu"},{"op":"watcher","nom":"lumiere-allumee"}]}
```

The file side is true for one poll only, so the two halves would essentially never be
true together. Use the state:

```json
{"op":"et","regles":[{"op":"existe"},{"op":"watcher","nom":"lumiere-allumee"}]}
```

**Rule of thumb: inside an `et`, use states. Alone, a transition is usually what you
want**, because "tell me when the file appears" should fire once, not every minute.

`absent` is how you catch what did NOT happen: no backup file this morning, an export
that never landed. Combine it with `heure_entre`. No transition can express that,
because nothing happened to observe.

## Correlating two watchers

One signal rarely means anything. Two together diagnose.

```json
{"op":"et","regles":[
  {"op":"watcher","nom":"site-down","depuis_min":5},
  {"op":"watcher","nom":"hote-repond"}]}
```

That says: the site has been down for five minutes AND the host still answers. The
application is broken, not the network. Alerting on the first leaf alone would wake
someone for a cut cable.

`watcher` reads another watcher's published verdict, so it is valid on every
`watcher_type`: it looks at that one's conclusion, not at this one's observation.

**Give the upstream watchers `{"type":"aucune"}`.** They exist to publish a verdict.
Without it each of them alerts on its own, so "the site is down" and "the host answers"
both reach the user alongside the single conclusion they actually asked for.

A worked example, "tell me if test.txt is on the desktop AND the office light is on":

```json
{"name":"lumiere-bureau","watcher_type":"command",
 "target":"openhue get light \"Bureau\"",
 "regles":{"op":"contient","motif":"[on]"},
 "action":{"type":"aucune"}}
```

```json
{"name":"alerte-bureau","watcher_type":"file",
 "target":"C:\\Users\\me\\Desktop\\test.txt",
 "regles":{"op":"et","regles":[
   {"op":"existe"},
   {"op":"watcher","nom":"lumiere-bureau"}]},
 "action":{"type":"notifier"}}
```

The sensor says nothing, the alert concludes. No script, no model call, and no cron.

Two rules that matter. An unknown name is FALSE, never an error, so a correlation whose
peer was deleted degrades quietly instead of breaking the tree on every poll. And the
verdicts are read from a SNAPSHOT taken before the round, not live, so the result never
depends on the order watchers happen to be polled in. The cost is one tick of latency
on a correlation, which is the right trade: an alert a minute late is fine, an alert
that fires at random is not.

## Pausing one

`watcher_toggle` with `id` and `active`. `false` pauses it, `true` starts it again. The
target, the rule and the action are kept untouched, so a paused watcher comes back
exactly as it was.

Prefer it to `watcher_delete` whenever the watcher is right but badly timed: noisy during
a migration, irrelevant while the user is away, firing on a machine that is down. Deleting
means rebuilding the rule later from memory, and a rule rebuilt from memory is a rule
that observes something slightly different.

Delete when the watcher is WRONG or the need is over. Pause when the need will come back.

A paused watcher still appears in `watcher_list`, with `active: false`. That is the
answer to "why did it stop telling me?" more often than a broken rule is.

## Removing one, and checking a file by hand

`watcher_delete` with `id` removes a watcher. Get the id from `watcher_list`; there is no
deletion by name or by target. Run `watcher_list` again afterwards to confirm it is gone,
because a watcher that survives keeps firing long after everyone forgot it exists.

`file_watch` with `path` and `since` is NOT a watcher. It is a one-shot question: was
this file modified after that timestamp? It answers now and monitors nothing. Use it to
check a single file inside a task. When the user wants to be TOLD when something happens,
they want a watcher.

## Examples

Warn me when `ala.txt` appears on the desktop, or disappears.

```json
{"watcher_type":"file","target":"C:\\Users\\me\\Desktop\\ala.txt",
 "regles":{"op":"ou","regles":[{"op":"apparu"},{"op":"supprime"}]}}
```

Ping me on Telegram if a line of release.log contains ERROR, but not at night.

```json
{"watcher_type":"log","target":"C:\\logs\\release.log",
 "regles":{"op":"et","regles":[
   {"op":"contient","motif":"ERROR"},
   {"op":"heure_entre","de":"08:00","a":"23:56"}]}}
```

On Tuesday or Thursday, if the local site has been down 10 minutes, remind me every 20.

```json
{"watcher_type":"url","target":"http://127.0.0.1:8080","interval_secs":60,
 "cooldown_secs":1200,
 "regles":{"op":"et","regles":[
   {"op":"jour_semaine","jours":["mar","jeu"]},
   {"op":"down_depuis_min","minutes":10}]}}
```

On Tuesdays, if the changelog mentions a security fix. The model is consulted only on
Tuesdays, and only when the page actually changed.

```json
{"watcher_type":"url","target":"https://example.com/changelog",
 "regles":{"op":"et","regles":[
   {"op":"jour_semaine","jours":["mar"]},
   {"op":"contenu_change"},
   {"op":"llm_check","question":"the new changelog content mentions a security vulnerability or fix"}]}}
```

## Failure modes

**Created, shown as active, never fires.** Almost always trap 1 or trap 2. Check the op
against `watcher_type`, then check the hour window: an unreadable one makes the whole
tree false at every hour.

**"missing field `op`" or "missing field `regles`".** The tree is not tagged, or the
child array is named `clauses`. Every node carries `op`; children live under `regles`.

**Fires far too often.** A state leaf with no cooldown. Set `cooldown_secs`.

**Fires once and never again** when it should repeat. An event leaf where a state leaf
was meant: `apparu` instead of `contient`, `retour_en_ligne` instead of `est_down`.
