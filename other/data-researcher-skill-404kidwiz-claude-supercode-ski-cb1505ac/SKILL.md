- **Correlation as Causation**: Interpreting correlations as causal relationships - use appropriate causal inference methods

### Data Quality Anti-Patterns

- **Garbage In, Gospel Out**: Uncritically accepting data quality - always perform data profiling
- **Selection Bias Blindness**: Ignoring how data was collected - document sampling methodology
- **Missing Data Ignorance**: Ignoring or improperly handling missing values - document and address missing data
- **Outlier Deletion**: Removing inconvenient data points without justification - document all data exclusions

### Communication Anti-Patterns

- **Statistical Overload**: drowning stakeholders in statistics - lead with insights, support with evidence
