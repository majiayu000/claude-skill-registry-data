# Error Recovery and Resilience (React 18)

## Summary

Engineer resilient UI systems with layered error boundaries, retries, and fallback orchestration.

## Key Capabilities

- Define error containment strategies for nested UI regions.
- Implement retry policies with exponential backoff and jitter.
- Integrate error telemetry and automated recovery flows.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Prove containment of error cascades across boundaries.
- Model user impact of fallback UI pathways.
- Evaluate resilience improvements with chaos testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Demonstrate isolated error recovery without full app reload.
- Provide telemetry of error boundaries and recovery paths.
- Include chaos-test results and mitigation strategies.
