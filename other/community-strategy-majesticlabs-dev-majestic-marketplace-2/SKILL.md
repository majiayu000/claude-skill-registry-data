# Community Strategy

Value-first strategies for organic traffic from Reddit, Discord, and Facebook groups.

## Platform Rules (Critical)

### Reddit
- **Self-promo limit:** 10% rule (90% value, 10% self-links)
- **Account requirements:** Many subs require 30+ days, 100+ karma
- **Ban triggers:** New account + promotional links, multiple subs same link
- **Safe approach:** Comment value for weeks before any links

### Discord
- **Self-promo limit:** Usually designated channels only
- **Ban triggers:** DMing members, posting links without permission
- **Safe approach:** Become known helper, get invited to share

### Facebook Groups
- **Self-promo limit:** Group-specific, usually 1x/week max
- **Ban triggers:** Joining just to post links, link-heavy posts
- **Safe approach:** Answer questions for 2+ weeks first

## Value-First Engagement Plan

### Week 1: Establish Presence
- Join 5-10 relevant communities
- Lurk and understand culture
- Save common questions people ask
- Upvote/react to quality posts

### Week 2: Start Contributing
- Answer 3-5 questions daily (no links)
- Share genuinely helpful tips
- Ask thoughtful questions
- Build recognition with regulars

### Week 3: Soft Authority
- Create helpful resource posts (no self-links)
- Share industry insights
- Help in comment threads
- People start recognizing your name

### Week 4: Strategic Sharing
- When relevant, mention your solution naturally
- "I built something for this" (only when asked or perfect fit)
- Link in profile, not in post
- Continue 90% pure value
