# Descriptive Test Names

Name tests to describe behavior: "should return empty array when no users match filter" not "testGetUsers1". Include context about the scenario and expected result. When a test fails, the name should tell you what broke. Use consistent naming conventions. Group related tests with describe blocks that provide additional context.
