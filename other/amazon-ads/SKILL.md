# Amazon Ads

Strategic guide for managing Amazon Ads Sponsored Products campaigns. Research first, validate products, optimize for ACoS targets.

## Requirements

- **Hyper MCP installed and connected.** [https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp](https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp)
- **Amazon Ads integration connected** at [https://app.hyperfx.ai/apps](https://app.hyperfx.ai/apps).

If `search("amazon_ads_profiles_list")` does not find `amazon_ads_profiles_list`, stop and tell the user to enable Hyper MCP and connect Amazon Ads.

### How to run the tools in this skill

Every tool in this skill is named by its canonical tool name. Run it with the call your surface gives you:

| Surface | Find a tool | Run it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP client (Claude, Cursor, Codex, ChatGPT) | `search("<what you want to do>")`, then `describe("<name>")` | `call("<name>", {...})` |
| Hyper CLI | `hyperai search "<what you want to do>"`, then `hyperai describe <name>` | `hyperai call <name> --json '{...}'` |

If a tool is not found, its integration is not connected or not enabled for the workspace: stop and tell the user which integration to connect.

## Out of scope — defer to other skills

- **Creative generation** (product imagery, copy) → [`ad-creative-generation`](../ad-creative-generation) / [`image-generation`](../image-generation).
- **Cross-platform campaign launches** → use this skill for Amazon, then invoke `meta-ads` / `google-ads` separately.

## Tool surface

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `amazon_ads_profiles_list`, `amazon_ads_health_check` | Profile discovery + integration health. |
| `amazon_ads_campaigns_list`, `amazon_ads_campaigns_create`, `amazon_ads_campaigns_update` | Campaign lifecycle. |
| `amazon_ads_ad_groups_create`, `amazon_ads_product_ads_create` | Ad group + product ad creation. |
| `amazon_ads_keywords_create`, `amazon_ads_negative_keywords_create`, `amazon_ads_campaign_negative_keywords_create` | Keyword targeting. |
| `amazon_ads_product_targets_create`, `amazon_ads_negative_product_targets_create` | Product (ASIN/category) targeting. |
| `amazon_ads_budget_rules_create`, `amazon_ads_budget_rules_list` | Budget automation. |
| `amazon_ads_reports_create`, `amazon_ads_reports_status_get` | Performance reporting. |
| `amazon_ads_bid_recommendations_get` | Theme-based bid recommendations. |

## Critical Rules

> **CRITICAL**: Keyword, negative keyword, product ad, and product target operations require BOTH `ad_group_id` AND `campaign_id`. Omitting `campaign_id` causes validation errors.

> **CRITICAL**: Keywords and product targets cannot coexist in the same ad group. Choose one targeting type per ad group.

> **CRITICAL**: AUTO campaigns only allow negative keywords and negative product targets. Positive keywords and product targets are rejected.

> **CRITICAL**: Campaign dates use `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Budget rule dates use `YYYYMMDD` format. Do not mix these up.

> **CRITICAL**: Create campaigns with state `"PAUSED"`. Never launch live without user review.

> **CRITICAL**: Negative product targets only support `ASIN_SAME_AS` and `ASIN_BRAND_SAME_AS` expressions. Category exclusions are not supported.

> **CRITICAL**: All enum values must be UPPERCASE: `PAUSED`, `ENABLED`, `BROAD`, `PHRASE`, `EXACT`, `NEGATIVE_EXACT`, `NEGATIVE_PHRASE`, `MANUAL`, `AUTO`.

> **IMPORTANT**: Portfolio operations return 404 for vendor accounts. Use campaign-level management instead.

> **IMPORTANT**: Budget rule listing may return empty even after successful creation. Track rule IDs from creation responses.

> **IMPORTANT**: All budgets are in dollars (not cents, not micros). $25 daily budget = `25`.

## Core process

Discovery → Research (products + keywords) → Strategy (auto vs manual) → Approve Summary → Create (PAUSED) → Add Keywords/Products → Add Negatives → Test (1–3 days) → Optimize → Activate only with user approval.

> **All reference files live in `references/`.** Read them at `references/<file>` (e.g. `references/discovery.md`).

## Routing table

| The user wants to… | Read these files first |
|---|---|
| Launch a Sponsored Products campaign | [references/discovery.md](references/discovery.md) → [references/campaign-creation.md](references/campaign-creation.md) |
| Add keywords / negatives / product targets to an existing campaign | [references/campaign-creation.md](references/campaign-creation.md) |
| Automate budgets (schedule or performance rules) | [references/budget-rules.md](references/budget-rules.md) |
| Analyze performance / ACoS / search terms | [references/reporting.md](references/reporting.md) |
| Get bid recommendations | [references/reporting.md](references/reporting.md) |
| Work across marketplaces (multi-profile) | [references/reporting.md](references/reporting.md) |
| Goal not yet clear | [references/discovery.md](references/discovery.md) — discovery clarifies the goal |

## Campaign Statuses

- `PAUSED`: Created but not live (safe default).
- `ENABLED`: Running and spending budget.
- `ARCHIVED`: Deleted (cannot be restored).

## Known Limitations

| Issue | Workaround |
| --- | --- |
| Portfolio operations return 404 (vendor) | Use campaign-level grouping + naming conventions. |
| Budget rule listing may return empty | Track rule IDs from creation responses. |
| Category recommendations may fail (500) | Use manual research or dashboard. |

## Safety Rules

**Never:**
- Assume ASINs or keywords — always ask.
- Skip the research/audit phase.
- Create campaigns without explicit approval.
- Set campaigns to ENABLED without user consent.
- Ignore ACoS targets when recommending bids.
- Add products the user hasn't confirmed.
- Mix keywords and product targets in the same ad group.
- Omit `campaign_id` from keyword/product operations.
