# Gmail Email Management

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for managing Gmail emails, labels, and organization.

## Requirements

- **Hyper MCP installed and connected.** [https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp](https://app.hyperfx.ai/mcp)
- **Gmail integration** enabled at [https://app.hyperfx.ai/apps](https://app.hyperfx.ai/apps).

### How to run the tools in this skill

Every tool in this skill is named by its canonical tool name. Run it with the call your surface gives you:

| Surface | Find a tool | Run it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP client (Claude, Cursor, Codex, ChatGPT) | `search("<what you want to do>")`, then `describe("<name>")` | `call("<name>", {...})` |
| Hyper CLI | `hyperai search "<what you want to do>"`, then `hyperai describe <name>` | `hyperai call <name> --json '{...}'` |

If a tool is not found, its integration is not connected or not enabled for the workspace: stop and tell the user which integration to connect.

## Label Operations - Critical Distinctions

### ADD LABEL (keeps email in current location + adds new label)
- Use: `gmail_labels_add`
- Use case: Adding labels WITHOUT moving the email from its current location
- Example: Email stays in INBOX and also gets labeled "Important"

### MOVE TO LABEL (removes from INBOX + adds to target label)
- Use: `gmail_messages_move_to_label`
- Use case: Moving email OUT of inbox and INTO a specific label/folder
- Example: Email is removed from INBOX and moved to "Archive" or "Work"
- This performs TWO operations: removes INBOX label + adds target label

### REMOVE LABEL (removes specific label)
- Use: `gmail_labels_remove`
- Use case: Removing labels from an email
- Can remove any label including INBOX

## Getting Label IDs

**CRITICAL**: Most Gmail label operations require label IDs, NOT label names.
- Always call `gmail_labels_list` first to get available labels and their IDs
- Label IDs look like: "Label_123", "Label_456", or system labels: "INBOX", "SENT", "TRASH"
- Never guess or make up label IDs

## Common Workflows

### Email Triage/Organization
1. Call `gmail_labels_list` to see available labels
2. Call `gmail_messages_list` to get emails
3. Use `gmail_messages_move_to_label` to move emails from INBOX to appropriate labels

### Adding Categories (keep in inbox)
1. Call `gmail_labels_list` to get label IDs
2. Use `gmail_labels_add` to categorize emails while keeping them in INBOX

### Creating New Labels
- Use `gmail_labels_create` if the desired label doesn't exist
- Returns the new label's ID for immediate use

## Searching and Listing Messages

**gmail_messages_list** supports full Gmail search query syntax:
- `query` parameter accepts the same syntax as Gmail's search box
- Examples: `"is:unread"`, `"from:user@example.com"`, `"has:attachment subject:invoice"`
- Combine operators: `"from:user@example.com is:unread has:attachment"`
- By default, excludes drafts (adds `-in:draft` automatically)
- Use `label` parameter to filter by specific label

## Drafts Workflow

### Creating and sending draft emails
1. `gmail_drafts_create` - Create initial draft
2. `gmail_drafts_update` - Edit existing draft (optional)
3. `gmail_drafts_send` - Send the draft as email

### Managing drafts
- `gmail_drafts_list` - List all draft emails
- `gmail_drafts_get` - Get a specific draft by ID
- `gmail_drafts_delete` - Delete a draft without sending

### When to use drafts vs direct send
- Use `gmail_messages_send` for immediate one-step sending
- Use draft workflow when you want to review/edit before sending or schedule for later

## Email Actions - Important Distinctions

### Archive vs Trash
- `gmail_messages_archive` - Removes from INBOX but keeps in "All Mail" (recoverable, not deleted)
- `gmail_messages_trash` - Moves to Trash folder (will be auto-deleted after 30 days)
- Archive is the preferred way to "clean up" inbox while keeping emails

### Attachments
- `gmail_attachments_get` - Download attachments from received emails
- When sending emails with attachments, use `file_ids` parameter (requires files to be in the database first)

## Tool Selection Quick Reference

| Action | Tool |
|--------|------|
| Add label X | `gmail_labels_add` |
| Move to label X | `gmail_messages_move_to_label` |
| Remove from inbox | `gmail_messages_move_to_label` (move to target) OR `gmail_labels_remove` (just remove INBOX) |
| Archive email | `gmail_messages_archive` (preferred for cleanup) |
| Delete/trash email | `gmail_messages_trash` |
| Send email now | `gmail_messages_send` |
| Create email for later | `gmail_drafts_create` + `gmail_drafts_send` |
