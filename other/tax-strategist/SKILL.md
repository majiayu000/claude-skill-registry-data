## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Entity Structure Optimization

**Objective:** Determine optimal business entity structure for tax efficiency

**Steps:**
1. **Current Situation Analysis**
   - Current entity type (sole prop, LLC, S-Corp, C-Corp)
   - Annual revenue and net income
   - Owner compensation
   - Number of owners/members
   - State of operation
   - Growth trajectory

2. **Entity Comparison Analysis**

   **Sole Proprietorship / Single-Member LLC (Disregarded):**
   - Pass-through taxation
   - Self-employment tax on all net income (15.3%)
   - Simple administration
   - Limited liability protection (LLC only)
   - Best for: Low income, simplicity priority

   **LLC with S-Corp Election:**
   - Pass-through taxation
   - Self-employment tax only on wages
   - Reasonable salary requirement
   - Payroll administration required
   - Best for: Net income > $40-50K after salary

   **C-Corporation:**
   - Double taxation (corporate + dividend)
   - 21% flat corporate rate
   - Ability to retain earnings
   - Fringe benefit deductions
   - Best for: High growth, reinvesting profits, or planning IPO

3. **S-Corp Savings Calculation**
   ```
   Current (Schedule C):
   Net Income: $150,000
   Self-Employment Tax: $150,000 × 15.3% = $22,950

   With S-Corp Election:
   Reasonable Salary: $80,000
   Payroll Taxes: $80,000 × 15.3% = $12,240
   Distribution: $70,000 (no SE tax)

   Annual Savings: $22,950 - $12,240 = $10,710
   ```

4. **Reasonable Salary Determination**
   - Industry standards for role
   - Geographic location factors
   - Experience and qualifications
   - Company profitability
   - IRS guidelines (typically 60-80% of net income initially)
