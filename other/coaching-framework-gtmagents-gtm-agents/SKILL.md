# Coaching Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Building competency rubrics for new roles or programs.
- Standardizing scoring across managers/enablement.
- Designing multi-week coaching plans that tie to measurable outcomes.

## Framework
1. **Competency Definition** – describe behaviors, leading/lagging indicators, and proof examples.
2. **Scoring Rubric** – create 1-5 or bronze/silver/gold tiers with observable criteria.
3. **Plan Template** – goals, drills, support resources, checkpoints, and certification path.
4. **Measurement Layer** – map KPIs (win rate, cycle, CSAT) and survey cadence.
5. **Feedback Loop** – collect calibration notes and continuously refine rubrics.

## Templates
- Competency card (behavior, signals, proof, resources).
- Coaching plan outline (objective, actions, timeline, owners).
- Calibration worksheet for manager huddles.

## Tips
- Keep rubrics no more than 4-5 competencies per program to aid adoption.
- Provide real call snippets/examples for each level to reduce ambiguity.
- Revisit quarterly with performance data to keep relevance high.
