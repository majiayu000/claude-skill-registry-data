# Social Content Creator

Transform any source material into high-performing social media posts using the **framework fitting method**: extract standalone concepts, match to proven templates, generate volume, select best, execute, and proliferate winners.

## Purpose

Content creation isn't about constantly coming up with new ideas. It's about turning 1 idea into 1000 variations using proven frameworks.

**Core Philosophy:** Good content follows proven formats. The skill is in **framework fitting** - matching concepts to the delivery mechanisms that amplify them best.

## When to Use This Skill

- Repurposing newsletter content into social posts
- Transforming long-form articles into multi-platform campaigns
- Creating LinkedIn posts from any concept or story
- Generating multiple post options quickly
- Multiplying high-performing posts using SCAMPER or desire reframing

**Not for:** Short-form video captions (use `video-caption-creation`), podcast clip selection (separate workflow)

---

## The Framework Fitting Method

### Core Principle
Good content follows proven formats/frameworks/templates. The skill is in **framework fitting** - matching concepts to the delivery mechanisms that amplify them best.

### Critical Rule: Avoid First-Match Bias
**Do NOT default to the first template that seems to fit.**

> "Analyze, Then Select" - Treat template selection as a distinct step. Consider ALL applicable frameworks before selecting.

The best framework might not be the obvious one.

---

## The 4-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Extract Standalone Concepts

**Goal:** Identify the most shareable "standalone" concepts from source material

#### Step 1: Read Source Material Thoroughly
- Full newsletter, article, or podcast transcript
- Look for bundles of ideas within their context
- Self-contained insights that can live independently

#### Step 2: Extract Concepts
For each standalone concept, capture:
- **Core Insight** (1-2 sentences)
- **Context Needed** (what background info is required?)
- **Emotion/Value** (what does this unlock for the reader?)
- **Human Desire(s)** (which of the 8 desires does this address?)
- **Potential Angles** (initial framework ideas)

**How Many Concepts to Extract:**
- Newsletter segment: 1-3 concepts per segment
- Full newsletter: 5-10 concepts total
- Long-form article: 5-15 concepts
- Podcast episode: 3-8 concepts

#### Step 3: Create Concepts Document

```markdown
# [Source] - Extracted Concepts

## Concept 1: [Title]
**Core Insight:** [1-2 sentences]
**Context:** [What background is needed]
**Emotion/Value:** [What this unlocks for reader]
**Human Desires:** [Which of the 8]
**Potential Angles:** [Framework ideas]

---

## Concept 2: [Title]
[Repeat structure...]
```

### The 8 Human Desires

Reference these when extracting concepts:

1. **Safety of Tribe** - Belonging, community, fitting in
2. **Survival & Success** - Progress, achievement, security
3. **Life Enjoyment** - Pleasure, experiences, freedom
4. **Social Acceptance** - Status, respect, recognition
5. **Sexual Companionship** - Connection, attraction (often not applicable)
6. **Comfort & Clarity** - Simplicity, ease, certainty
7. **Freedom From Fear** - Safety, protection, security
8. **Perceived Status** - Respect, authority, expertise

---

### Phase 2: Framework Matching (THE CRITICAL PHASE)

**Goal:** Match extracted concepts to best-fit frameworks using volume generation → selection

#### The Framework Matching Process

**For each concept:**

1. **Brainstorm First:** How COULD this concept be presented?
   - Think beyond the obvious
   - Consider different platforms
   - Imagine different emotional angles

2. **Review ALL Applicable Frameworks:**
   - LinkedIn templates (86+ options)
   - Text post structures (100+ options)
   - Don't stop at first match
   - Consider at least 5-10 frameworks minimum

3. **Test the Fit:**
   - Does concept naturally fit framework structure?
   - What would make this concept fit BETTER in another framework?
   - Which framework amplifies the core emotion/value most?

4. **Generate Volume:**
   - Quick social plan: 2-4 framework matches per concept
   - High-volume campaign: 10-20 framework matches per concept

5. **Select Best:**
   - Which frameworks amplify the concept most?
   - Which platforms matter most?
   - Which formats are most efficient to execute?

#### Framework Categories

**LinkedIn Templates** (see `references/linkedin-frameworks.md`):
- 86+ templates from LinkedIn swipe files
- 50+ templates from proven creators
- Best for: Thought leadership, educational content, stories

**Text Post Structures** (see `references/post-structures.md`):
- 100+ proven tweet/post frameworks
- Best for: X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram captions
- Categories: Comparisons, Lists, Challenges, Observations, Analogies

#### Document Framework Matches

```markdown
## Concept: "[Title]"

### Framework Matches Generated (10 total):

**1. Pattern Recognition Template**
- **Fit Assessment:** ✅ STRONG
- **Why it fits:** [Explanation]
- **Structure:** "I've noticed a pattern: [Common Belief] isn't what leads to [Success]... It's [Core Insight]"
- **Platform:** LinkedIn
- **Execution Preview:** "[Draft of how it would read]"

**2. Contrarian Truth Template**
- **Fit Assessment:** ✅ STRONG / ⚠️ MODERATE / ❌ WEAK
- **Why it fits:** [Explanation]
[Continue...]

### SELECTED FOR EXECUTION (Top 3):
1. [Framework] - [Rationale]
2. [Framework] - [Rationale]
3. [Framework] - [Rationale]
```

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Generated at least 5-10 framework options per concept
- [ ] Assessed fit strength (STRONG/MODERATE/WEAK)
- [ ] Explained WHY concept fits each framework
- [ ] Selected best 2-4 with clear rationale
- [ ] Considered platform appropriateness
- [ ] Avoided first-match bias

---

### Phase 3: Execute Selected Frameworks

**Goal:** Create polished, platform-optimized posts from selected frameworks

#### Determine Output Scope

- **Quick Social Plan** (1-3 posts): Best framework match per concept
- **Multi-Platform Campaign** (5-10 posts): Multiple frameworks across concepts
- **High-Volume Repurposing** (10-20 posts): 2-3 variations per framework

#### Execute Each Framework

1. **Load Framework Structure** - Reference the specific template
2. **Fill with Concept Details** - Insert insight, context, examples
3. **Apply Voice** - Match brand or individual voice style
4. **Platform-Specific Optimization** - Apply rules below
5. **Generate Variations** - Create 1-3 variations of same framework

#### Platform-Specific Guidelines

**LinkedIn:**
- **Length:** Long-form value-dense posts outperform (200-500 words)
- **Links:** Always in comments (not main post)
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 maximum, minimal
- **Voice:** Professional yet conversational, thought leadership
- **Hook:** First 2 lines critical (shows before "see more")
- **Structure:** Hook → Body → Insight → Question or CTA
- **Tagging:** Tag mentioned people/orgs (increases reach)

**X (Twitter):**
- **Length:** 70-100 characters optimal (despite 280 limit)
- **Hashtags:** 1-2 maximum
- **Voice:** Witty, concise, to-the-point
- **Threads:** Use for longer concepts
- **Current strategy:** Reply game important for growth

**Facebook:**
- **Length:** 40-140 characters optimal
- **Links:** NO external links in main post (kills reach)
- **Hashtags:** NO hashtags (Facebook doesn't reward them)
- **Voice:** Informal, playful, personable
- **Format:** Question posts with images perform best

**Instagram:**
- **Length:** 30-125 characters for feed captions
- **Hashtags:** 5-10 relevant hashtags
- **Voice:** Friendly, authentic, micro-story format
- **Formats:** Reels outperform static, carousels for educational

#### Post Output Format

### Phase 4: Proliferate Winners (OPTIONAL)

**Goal:** Multiply high-performing posts using SCAMPER, Human Desires, and Vision reframing

**When to use:**
- Monthly: Study top performers and multiply them
- Pre-posting: Generate many options, select best
- Content drought: Multiply existing winners

#### Method 1: SCAMPER Variations

Generate 7 variations from one post (one per letter):

**S - Substitute**
- Replace main idea with adjacent concept
- Swap the method for accomplishing benefit
- Change examples while keeping structure

**C - Combine**
- Merge with personal experience or story
- Combine two concepts for more power
- Add reply to someone else's post as your own content

**A - Adapt**
- Expand one-liner into full post or thread
- Add "missing piece" not in original
- Adapt to different platform

**M - Modify**
- Magnify specific pain points
- Use same idea in different format
- Make more punchy by removing words

**P - Purpose** (Put to other use)
- Angle for different audience segment
- Different benefit/pain point this solves

**E - Eliminate**
- Remove words to make punchier
- Simplify complex explanation
- Cut nuance and uncertainty

**R - Reverse**
- Flip the idea completely
- "With X you get Y" → "Without X you stay stuck with Z"
- Positive framing → negative (or vice versa)

**SCAMPER Example:**

Original:
> "The most successful founders don't start with funding. They start with customers."

**S - Substitute:**
> "The most successful founders don't start with a perfect product. They start with a painful problem."

**C - Combine:**
> "I spent years thinking I needed funding to start. Then I talked to 3 founders who bootstrapped to $10M. The most successful don't start with funding. They start with customers."

**R - Reverse:**
> "Without customers, your funding means nothing. Ask any startup that raised $50M and still failed."

#### Method 2: Human Desires Reframing

Spin concept through 8 desire lenses:

**Example concept:** "Customers over funding"

**Safety of Tribe:**
> "You don't need VCs to validate your idea. You need customers who get it. Build your tribe first."

**Survival & Success:**
> "The path to success isn't through investors. Every successful founder knows: customers first, funding later."

**Comfort & Clarity:**
> "Starting a company feels overwhelming. Here's what brings clarity: successful founders don't start with funding. They start with customers. Everything else follows."

**Freedom From Fear:**
> "The fear of 'not having enough runway' stops more companies than lack of funding. Get customers first. The fear disappears."

#### Proliferation Output

Create file: `[Post Title]_Proliferations.md`

Include:
- 7 SCAMPER variations
- 6-8 Human Desire reframes
- **Total: 13-15 new variations from 1 original**

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Content Issues
❌ **First-Match Bias** - Picking first framework that fits
❌ **Generic Posts** - Not using any framework
❌ **Too Many Concepts** - Multiple ideas in one post
❌ **Missing Context** - Concept doesn't stand alone

### Framework Issues
❌ **Framework Drift** - Abandoning structure mid-post
❌ **Mismatched Fit** - Forcing concept into wrong framework
❌ **No Volume** - Creating only 1 option instead of 5-10+

### Platform Issues
❌ **Wrong Link Placement** - External links in Facebook/LinkedIn main posts
❌ **Hashtag Overload** - Too many for platform
❌ **Voice Mismatch** - Too formal for Facebook, too casual for LinkedIn

### Process Issues
❌ **Skipping Concept Extraction** - Writing without identifying standalone concepts
❌ **Not Documenting Framework** - Can't reference what worked later

---
