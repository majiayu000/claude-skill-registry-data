# Pricing Page Optimizer

Transform your pricing page into a conversion engine that guides visitors to the right plan and encourages upgrades. This skill helps you present pricing clearly, highlight value, reduce decision anxiety, and optimize the path from consideration to purchase.

Your pricing page is where interest becomes commitment - or bounces. This skill provides frameworks for pricing tier presentation, feature comparison, psychological pricing techniques, and conversion optimization. Learn how to use anchoring, decoy pricing, and value framing to improve plan selection and average order value.

Essential for SaaS companies, subscription businesses, and anyone presenting tiered pricing to customers.
