# Jujutsu (jj) Version Control System

## Overview

Jujutsu is a powerful Git-compatible version control system that combines ideas from Git, Mercurial, Darcs, and adds novel features. It uses Git repositories as a storage backend, making it fully interoperable with existing Git tooling.

**Key differentiators from Git:**
- Working copy is automatically committed (no staging area)
- Conflicts can be committed and resolved later
- Automatic rebasing of descendants when commits change
- Operation log enables easy undo of any operation
- Revsets provide powerful commit selection
- Change IDs stay stable across rewrites (unlike commit hashes)

## When to Use This Skill

- User mentions "jj", "jujutsu", or "jujutsu vcs"
- Working with stacked/dependent commits, or bookmarks (jj's branches)
- Change IDs vs commit IDs; revset queries for selecting commits
- Conflict resolution, or history rewriting (squash, split, rebase, diffedit)
- Git interoperability, operation log, undo/redo

## Key Concepts

### Working Copy as a Commit

In jj, the working copy is always a commit and changes are snapshotted automatically. There is no `git add`; `jj status` and `jj diff` report the working-copy commit.

### When Snapshots Are Triggered

The working copy is snapshotted into `@` when running most jj commands (`new`, `status`, `diff`, `log`, `describe`). Force a snapshot with `jj util snapshot` or just run any jj command.

### Change ID vs Commit ID

- **Change ID**: Stable identifier that persists across rewrites (e.g., `kntqzsqt`)
- **Commit ID**: Hash that changes when commit is rewritten (e.g., `5d39e19d`)

Always prefer change IDs when referring to commits in commands.

**Versioned access (0.37+):** Use `xyz/n` suffix to access hidden/divergent versions:
- `xyz/0` - latest version of change xyz
- `xyz/1` - previous version (useful for `jj restore --from xyz/1 --to xyz`)
- Shown automatically in `jj log` for divergent changes

### No Staging Area

Instead of staging, use these patterns:
- `jj split` - Split working copy into multiple commits
- `jj squash -i` - Interactively move changes to parent
- Direct editing with `jj diffedit`
- Hunk-level selection **without** a TUI: the external `jj-hunk` tool, if installed - see [references/jj-hunk.md](references/jj-hunk.md)

### First-Class Conflicts

Conflicts are recorded in commits, not blocking operations: `jj rebase -s X -o Y` succeeds even when it conflicts, and `jj log` marks the result with ×. Resolve whenever convenient - see [Resolving Conflicts](#resolving-conflicts).

### Operation Log

Every operation is recorded and can be undone or inspected - see [Undoing Mistakes](#undoing-mistakes).

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Change

```bash
# Working copy changes are auto-committed
# When ready to start fresh work:
jj new                    # Create new commit on top
jj describe -m "message"  # Set description
# Or combine:
jj new -m "Start feature X"
```

### Editing a Previous Commit

```bash
# Option 1: Edit in place
jj edit <change-id>       # Make working copy edit that commit
# Make changes, they're auto-committed
jj new                    # Return to working on new changes

# Option 2: Squash changes into parent
jj squash                 # Move all changes to parent
jj squash -i              # Interactively select changes

# Option 3: Auto-squash into correct commits in stack
jj absorb                 # Each hunk goes to commit that last changed those lines
jj absorb -i              # (0.44+) Pick which hunks to consider; rest stay in source
```

**Non-interactively:** `-i` opens the `:builtin` diff editor, which automation cannot drive. If `command -v jj-hunk` succeeds, `jj-hunk squash 'function("handle_request")'` and `jj-hunk absorb --dry-run` do the same work from a query. See [references/jj-hunk.md](references/jj-hunk.md).

### Running a Command Across a Stack (`jj run`, 0.43+)

Checks out each revision in its own isolated working copy, runs the command, amends the revision, and rebases descendants so the fix propagates:

```bash
jj run -r 'trunk()..@' -- cargo fix     # Rewrite each commit in the stack
jj run -j 4 -- pre-commit run           # Parallel (start order is oldest-first)
jj run --ignore-changes -- cargo test   # Just run it; never rewrite commits
jj run --passthrough --ignore-errors -- make lint  # Stream output; don't stop on failure
```

### Rebasing Commits

```bash
# Rebase current branch onto main (-d is a still-working alias for -o/--onto)
jj rebase -o main

# Rebase specific revision and descendants
jj rebase -s <rev> -o <destination>

# Rebase only specific revisions (not descendants)
jj rebase -r <rev> -o <destination>

# Insert commit between others
jj rebase -r X -A Y       # Insert X after Y
jj rebase -r X -B Y       # Insert X before Y

# Simplify redundant parents during rebase
jj rebase -s <rev> -o <dest> --simplify-parents
```

### Reordering Commits with `jj arrange`

```bash
jj arrange <revset>       # Open TUI to reorder/abandon commits
```

The TUI shows selected commits with their immediate parents/children. Use swap up/down to reorder along graph edges.

### Working with Bookmarks (Branches)

```bash
jj bookmark list          # List bookmarks
jj bookmark create <name> # Create at current commit
jj bookmark set <name>    # Move bookmark to current commit
jj bookmark delete <name> # Delete bookmark
jj bookmark track <name> --remote <remote>  # Track remote bookmark
jj bookmark advance       # Move bookmark forward to @ (like "jj tug")
```

**Gotchas:** Use `--allow-backwards` to move a bookmark to an ancestor. The `*` suffix in log means diverged from remote (push to sync). Use `bookmark set` (not `create`) if the bookmark may already exist on a remote.

### Searching File Contents

**Breaking in 0.44:** `-p`/`--pattern` is a **required flag**; positional args are **filesets**, not the pattern. Output now prints each matched line prefixed by its path (was: paths only).

```bash
jj file search -p foo                # Regex (default kind) -> "b.txt:alpha foo"
jj file search -p foo --name-only    # Paths only (pre-0.44 behavior)
jj file search -p foo -n             # Prefix each match with its line number
jj file search -p 'substring:foo'    # Substring match
jj file search -p 'glob:*foo*'       # Glob must match the WHOLE line
jj file search -p foo 'glob:*.rs'    # Limit to a fileset
jj file search -r <rev> -p foo       # Search at a specific revision
```

### Pushing Changes

```bash
# Push specific bookmark
jj git push --bookmark <name>

# Push change by creating auto-named bookmark
jj git push --change <change-id>

# Push all bookmarks AND tags (0.44+); skips ineligible: private/conflicted
jj git push --all

# Pass push options to remote server
jj git push --bookmark <name> --option key=value
```

**Reorder a pushed/stacked branch:** `jj rebase --ignore-immutable -s <change> -o <dest>` (descendants auto-rebase), then `jj git push --bookmark <name>` — `jj git push` is force-with-lease-safe by default (no flag). See [references/github-workflow.md](references/github-workflow.md).

### Resolving Conflicts

```bash
# After a rebase creates conflicts:
jj log                    # Find conflicted commit (marked with ×)
jj new <conflicted>       # Create commit on top
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
jj squash                 # Move resolution into conflicted commit

# Or use external merge tool:
jj resolve                # Opens merge tool for each conflict
jj resolve --list         # List all conflicted files
```

### Binary & Merge Conflicts

Binary files can't hold conflict markers - pick a version with `jj restore --from main path/to/binary.wasm`. Multi-parent merge conflicts use the same new/edit/squash loop above. Create a merge with:

```bash
jj new branch-a branch-b branch-c -m "integration: merge features"
```

### Undoing Mistakes

```bash
jj undo                   # Undo last operation
jj redo                   # Redo undone operation
jj op log                 # View operation history
jj op revert <op-id>      # Revert specific operation
jj op restore <op-id>     # Restore to specific state

# View repo at past operation
jj --at-op=<op-id> log

# Run command without affecting repo state (read-only inspection)
jj --no-integrate-operation log -r 'trunk()..@'
```

## Revsets Quick Reference

| Expression | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `@` | Working copy commit |
| `@-` | Parent of working copy |
| `x-` | Parents of x |
| `x+` | Children of x |
| `::x` | Ancestors of x (inclusive) |
| `x::` | Descendants of x (inclusive) |
| `x..y` | Ancestors of y not in ancestors of x |
| `x::y` | Commits between x and y (DAG path) |
| `bookmarks()` | All bookmark targets |
| `trunk()` | Main branch (main/master) |
| `mine()` | Commits by current user |
| `conflicts()` | Commits with conflicts |
| `divergent()` | Divergent changes |
| `description(text)` | Commits with matching description |
| `diff_lines(text)` | Commits with matching diff content |
| `remote_tags()` | Remote tag targets |

**Examples:**
```bash
jj log -r '@::'           # Working copy and descendants
jj log -r 'trunk()..@'    # Commits between trunk and working copy
jj log -r 'mine() & ::@'  # My commits in working copy ancestry
jj rebase -s 'roots(trunk()..@)' -o trunk()  # Rebase branch onto trunk
```

## Git Interoperability

### Colocated Repositories

By default, `jj git clone` and `jj git init` create colocated repos where both `jj` and `git` commands work:

```bash
jj git clone <url>        # Creates colocated repo (default)
jj git clone --no-colocate <url>  # Non-colocated (jj only)
```

### Converting Existing Git Repo

```bash
cd existing-git-repo
jj git init --colocate    # Add jj to existing Git repo
```

In colocated repos, Git changes are imported/exported automatically on every jj command. **Since 0.44, `jj git import` and `jj git export` are inert here** — not errors: they print `No import needed in colocated workspaces.`, exit 0, and change nothing (they were usually no-ops and had a race condition). So re-sync by running any jj command (e.g. `jj st`); if you genuinely suspect divergence, force one with `jj git import --ignore-working-copy`. Best practice: primarily use jj commands.

### Tags Are First-Class (0.44+)

`jj git fetch` now fetches tags like bookmarks — as `<name>@<remote>`, auto-tracked by a local tag of the same name. Git's `tagOpt` is no longer respected; control fetching with `remotes.<remote>.fetch-tags` in jj config (a *pattern*, e.g. `'~*'` to disable). `jj git push --all` pushes tags too.

```bash
jj tag list                     # List tags and targets
jj tag set <name> -r <rev>      # Create/update a tag
jj tag track <name>@<remote>    # Start/stop tracking a remote tag
```

**Gotcha:** `tags()` is part of `builtin_immutable_heads()`, so newly-tracked tags can make previously-mutable commits immutable.

### Colocated repos: Git sees `@` as uncommitted

Git's `HEAD` tracks `@`'s **parent** (`@-`), so `@`'s own changes look uncommitted to git. `git checkout`/`git switch` (and git-based tooling — `gh`, git-chain, hooks) **can abort** — but only when the target branch touches the *same files* as the `@`-vs-parent diff (`error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout … Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches. Aborting`); with no file overlap the checkout succeeds and carries the change over. Fix — park `@` so the tree is fully committed first:

```bash
jj new <bookmark>         # empty commit on the tip → clean, fully-committed tree
git checkout <bookmark>   # now succeeds
```

## Configuration

Edit config with `jj config edit --user` (or `--repo` for per-repo config, stored outside the repo since 0.38):

```toml
[user]
name = "Your Name"
email = "your@email.com"

[ui]
default-command = "log"   # Run 'jj log' when no command given
diff-editor = ":builtin"  # For interactive diff editing (split, squash -i)

[revset-aliases]
'wip' = 'description(exact:"") & mine()'  # Custom revset alias
```

**For automation/LLMs:** Use `-m` flags instead of relying on editors. See [Non-Interactive Workflows](#non-interactive-workflows) for patterns that work without user interaction.

See [references/configuration.md](references/configuration.md) for comprehensive configuration options including editor setup for interactive use.

## Template Language

Customize output with `-T`/`--template`:

```bash
jj log -T 'change_id.short(8) ++ " " ++ description.first_line() ++ "\n"'
jj log -T 'if(conflict, "CONFLICT ", "") ++ description.first_line()'
```

Key: `++` concatenates, `if(cond, then, else)` conditionals, `separate(sep, ...)` joins non-empty. See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md).

## Filesets

Select files in commands using fileset expressions:

```bash
jj diff 'glob:*.rs'              # Rust files in cwd
jj diff '~Cargo.lock'            # Everything except Cargo.lock
jj split 'glob:**/test_*'        # Test files only
jj log -r 'files("src")'         # Commits touching src/
```

See [references/filesets.md](references/filesets.md).

## Troubleshooting

**"Working copy is dirty"** - Never happens in jj! Working copy is always a commit.

**Conflicts after rebase** - Normal in jj. Conflicts are recorded, resolve when convenient.

**Lost commits** - Use `jj op log` to find when commits existed, then `jj op restore`.

**Divergent changes** - Same change ID, different commits. Usually from concurrent edits:
```bash
jj log                    # Shows divergent commits with xyz/0, xyz/1 suffixes
jj diff --from xyz/0 --to xyz/1  # Compare versions
jj abandon <unwanted>     # Remove one version
jj restore --from xyz/1 --to xyz  # Restore to previous version
```

**Immutable commit error** - Can't modify `trunk()`, tags, or **untracked remote bookmarks** (e.g. branches pushed via `git`/`gh`/git-chain, not `jj git push`) by default:
```bash
jj --ignore-immutable <command>   # Override globally (before the subcommand)
jj <command> --ignore-immutable   # Or after the subcommand — both work
# then push
```

## Non-Interactive Workflows

Many jj commands open an editor by default. Use these flags for automation and CLI workflows:

### Commit Messages Without Editor

| Command | Non-Interactive Flag | Example |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| `jj describe` | `-m` or `--stdin` | `jj describe -m "Fix bug"` |
| `jj commit` | `-m` | `jj commit -m "Add feature"` |
| `jj new` | `-m` | `jj new -m "Start new work"` |
| `jj squash` | `-m` or `-u` | `jj squash -u` (use destination message) |
| `jj split` | `-m` (first commit only) | `jj split -m "First part" <files>` |

### Squash Without Editor

`jj squash -u` (`--use-destination-message`) keeps the destination's message; `jj squash -m "..."` sets one explicitly. If either commit has an empty description, jj silently uses the non-empty one.

### Conflict Resolution Without Merge Tool

```bash
# Use built-in tools instead of external merge tool
jj resolve --tool :ours <file>      # Take "our" version (side #1)
jj resolve --tool :theirs <file>    # Take "their" version (side #2)

# Or use restore for complete replacement
jj restore --from <rev> <file>      # Take file from specific revision
```

### Inherently Interactive Commands

Cannot be made non-interactive: `jj diffedit`, `jj arrange` (TUI), `jj resolve` without `--tool`, and `jj split` without file arguments (workaround: pass paths, e.g. `jj split -m "First part" src/file1.rs`).

Path arguments cannot go finer than a whole file. For hunk-level selection with no editor, the optional `jj-hunk` tool covers `split`, `commit`, `squash`, `diffedit`, `restore` and `absorb` - see [references/jj-hunk.md](references/jj-hunk.md).

## Common Pitfalls

### Push Flag Combinations

| Flag | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `--all` | All bookmarks **and tags**, including new ones (0.44+) |
| `--tracked` | Tracked bookmarks and tags that changed |
| `-b`/`--bookmark <pattern>` | Specific bookmark; auto-tracks if new |
| `-t`/`--tag <pattern>` | Specific tag (0.44+) |
| `-c`/`--change <id>` | Creates/pushes auto-named bookmark (auto-tracked) |
| `--named name=<rev>` | Push a revision under a brand-new bookmark name |
| `--allow-conflicts` | Allow pushing commits containing conflicts (0.44+) |
| `--allow-private`, `--allow-empty-description` | Lift the corresponding eligibility check |
| `-o`/`--option key=value` | Pass push options to server |

**Removed in 0.42:** `--allow-new` no longer exists (`error: unexpected argument`). It is unnecessary — `--bookmark`/`--tag`/`--change`/`--named` now track new remote refs automatically, and `--all` includes new ones.

**Note (0.41+):** `--all`, `--tracked`, and `-r REVSETS` don't fail when revisions are private or conflicted - ineligible refs are silently skipped.

### Working Copy Changes on Merge Commits

When you `jj edit` a merge commit, changes appear as "working copy changes" - this is expected. Run `jj new` to start a fresh commit on top. An empty, description-less, bookmark-less `@` is **auto-abandoned** when you move off it (e.g. via `jj new`), so a manual `jj abandon` is usually unnecessary.

### Bookmark Movement Refused

If `jj bookmark set` fails because it would move "backwards":

```bash
jj bookmark set name -r <rev> --allow-backwards
```

This flag is required when moving a bookmark to an ancestor of its current position.

## Minimum Version Requirements

| Feature | Min Version |
|---------|-------------|
| `xyz/n` change offset syntax | 0.37+ |
| `jj file search`; name patterns (bookmark/tag) default to glob | 0.37+ |
| `jj file search -p` required (kind defaults to **regex**), prints matched lines, `-n` | 0.44+ |
| `divergent()`, `remote_tags()`, `diff_lines()` revsets | 0.38+ |
| `git_web_url()`, `hyperlink()` templates | 0.38+ |
| `jj arrange`, `jj bookmark advance` | 0.39+ |
| List methods (`first`, `last`, `get`, `reverse`, `skip`, `take`) | 0.39+ |
| Pattern aliases, fileset aliases | 0.39+ |
| `diff_lines_added()`, `diff_lines_removed()` | 0.40+ |
| `replace()` template, `--no-integrate-operation` | 0.41+ |
| `jj show` accepts multiple revisions | 0.42+ |
| `jj run`, `forks()` revset, `jj show --reversed`, `jj config gc` | 0.43+ |
| `jj tag track/untrack`, `jj absorb -i`, `--allow-conflicts`, `merge_point()`, `builtin_log()` | 0.44+ |

**Removed:** `jj git push --allow-new` (0.42); `git_head()`/`git_refs()` revsets & templates (0.43); `jj git import`/`export` in colocated workspaces (0.44).
