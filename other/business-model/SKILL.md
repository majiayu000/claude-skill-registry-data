## Preflight


Run canonical pre-flight per `contracts/preflight.md`.

Include the `X-Agentii-Trace` header on every tool call per `contracts/x-agentii-trace-header.md` — carry the `_run_id` from your first tool result and name yourself (and your parent, if you were spawned).
## Triggers

- analyze the business model of {ticker}
- run business model analysis on {ticker}
- decompose the business model of {ticker}
- what does {ticker} sell and how does it make money
- classify the business model type of {ticker}
- analyze {ticker} product offerings and distribution channels
- assess {ticker} revenue composition and concentration risk
- evaluate {ticker} TAM SAM SOM and market positioning
- analyze {ticker} management team and leadership changes
- review {ticker} go-to-market strategy
- breakdown {ticker} customer segments and distribution model
- structural analysis of {ticker}
- business unit performance analysis for {ticker}
- competitive positioning of {ticker}

## Defaults

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| lookback_quarters | 4 | Trailing 4 fiscal quarters (latest 10-K + trailing 10-Qs); a single-quarter snapshot is INSUFFICIENT for business-model classification |
| include_management_changes | true | Whether to surface leadership-change analysis (mode 1_5) |
| include_market_sizing | true | Whether to surface TAM/SAM/SOM (mode 1_4) |
| peer_set | none | Business-model analysis is single-issuer by default; peers are added by `/agentii:competitive` |

## Production Grounding

Production data-plane grounding (scale, locators) is in `references/methodology.md`.

## Data Source Priority (mandatory order)

1. **XBRL FIRST (grounding truth)** — `search_xbrl_facts` with the detailed/segment view for revenue & margins broken down by product line, segment, geography, and distribution channel (concepts `Revenues`, `GrossProfit`, `OperatingIncomeLoss`, `SegmentReportingInformation`). Retrieve XBRL BEFORE any document discovery.
2. **SEC filings** — `search_documents` / `search_sec_filings` for the 10-K (annual, richest business overview), trailing 10-Q, and 20-F for foreign issuers → `read_source_pages` enrichment.
3. **Web search = LAST RESORT** — only when SEC/XBRL coverage is genuinely insufficient (e.g., third-party TAM estimates, very recent unfiled events), and it MUST be flagged in Coverage Gaps. Web search is NOT an MCP tool and is never a substitute for filings.

## Methodology

### 1. Retrieval Scope

This skill performs **unstructured document search at scale** (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K filings and earnings call transcripts). The three-layer agent-use-ready retrieval protocol applies (Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3). For foreign issuers, use 20-F (annual) and 6-K (material events) instead of 10-K and 8-K respectively.

### 2. Retrieval Strategy

See `contracts/retrieval.md` for the canonical decision tree; skill-specific retrieval detail is in `references/methodology.md`.

**Read before you quote.** A page's `description` is **platform-generated** — it is never the issuer's
words and must never be quoted as the filing's. When a description identifies a relevant page,
`read_source_pages` that page and quote its `page_content`. **The description is a pointer, not a
source**: a citation written from one is the fabricated quote this skill's output standard exists to
prevent (`contracts/retrieval.md` § *Three-Layer Document Protocol*).

### 3. Temporal Scope

Default: 4 fiscal quarters (max 8). A single-quarter snapshot is INSUFFICIENT for business-model classification — use the latest 10-K (annual) plus trailing 10-Qs. Extend the window when explicitly tracking channel-mix evolution (mode 1_2 default 12 quarters) or management changes (mode 1_5 default 4 quarters).

### 4. Tool Allowlist

See frontmatter `allowed_tools`.

- `search_companies`, `get_company_profile` — issuer resolution and sector classification.
- `search_xbrl_facts`, `list_xbrl_concepts`, `get_company_financials` — segment-level P&L and revenue concentration metrics.
- `search_documents`, `search_sec_filings` — Layer 1 document discovery (with `secondary_labels` filter).
- `read_source_outline`, `read_source_pages`, `search_keyword_in_source` — Layer 2/3 deep read for business-overview pages.
- `get_company_fiscal_calendar`, `get_ticker_coverage` — pre-flight (mandatory first step).

### 5. Protocol

Step-by-step execution detail is in `references/methodology.md`.

**Moat Assessment**: When evaluating competitive advantage durability, apply the Sustainable Value Creation framework in `references/moat-methodology.md`. Quantify the ROIC−WACC spread magnitude, calibrate sustainability using sector-level ROIC autocorrelation data (Consumer Staples r=0.46 → Energy r=0.15), classify industry structure (Fragmented/Oligopoly/Dominant/Network/Commodity), and apply the 67-item Moat Checklist. High current ROIC in a rapid-mean-reversion industry is not a moat.

## Modes (5 — structural equity analysis)

This skill delivers analyst-grade output via 5 addressable mode(s); invoke with `--mode=<slug>` / `--modes=<slug1>,<slug2>` / `--mode=all` (see [Mode syntax](../../../../docs/commands/MODE_SYNTAX.md). The default invocation (no flag) runs the `essentials_modes` subset declared in this skill's frontmatter.

### Analyst Modes

This skill exposes addressable analysis modes (`--mode=<slug>` / `--modes=<s1>,<s2>` / `--mode=all`; see [Mode syntax](../../../../docs/commands/MODE_SYNTAX.md)). The full mode definitions and their output templates live in `references/modes.md`. The default invocation runs the essentials subset.

## Tool Fallbacks

Per-tool failure modes and fallback actions are tabulated in `references/tool-fallbacks.md`.

## Output File

Write the final deliverable to `{ticker}/{YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM}_business-model_{affix}.md`.

**Output Directory Rule**: write to `{ticker}/` (e.g. `NVDA/`) — NEVER `{ticker}-recent-quarter/` or any dimension-suffixed variant. The directory is the bare uppercase ticker; the skill name appears only in the filename, never the directory.

## Output Structure

The deliverable is a structured markdown report written to the path in `## Output File`. Full section-by-section template (headings, tables, and field definitions) lives in `references/output-structure.md`. Required elements:

1. **Executive Summary** — headline conclusions (≤200 words).
2. **Core analysis sections** — per this skill's methodology and analyst modes.
3. **Data classification** — tag findings `[FACT]` / `[DEDUCTED]` / `[VIEW]` per `contracts/snapshot-synthesis.md`.
4. **Coverage Gaps & Citations** — coverage gaps are required; inline `/v/` citations are the citation surface (immediately after each fact). A bottom roll-up index is optional, and where kept it must not repeat a link the prose already carries.
5. **Output frontmatter** — emit the FR-090 structured block per `contracts/output-frontmatter-schema.md`.

**Citations & memory**: follow `contracts/citation-and-memory.md` — ≥1 citation per 200 words; every material fact, table row, and metric is immediately followed by its inline clickable `https://agentii.ai/v/{ticker}/{citation_id}/{N}` link; citations belong inline, a bottom roll-up index is optional and never a repeat of a link already given; the closing TUI reply includes a compact **Key Citations** list (headline 5–10 facts) of clickable `/v/` URLs; and append the run to `agentii.md` per `contracts/agentii-md-schema.md`.

## Memory & Snapshot

- **Memory load** (pre-flight): load prior workspace context for the ticker before retrieval — see `contracts/memory-load.md`.
- **Structured output frontmatter**: emit the FR-090 block (`key_metrics`, `conclusions`, `facts_count`, `deducted_count`, `views_count`, `citation_count`) per `contracts/output-frontmatter-schema.md`.
- **Snapshot synthesis**: after writing the deliverable, update the two-tier snapshot and classify findings as `[FACT]`/`[DEDUCTED]`/`[VIEW]` — see `contracts/snapshot-synthesis.md`.
- **Session archival**: record the run under `sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}/` and update `sessions/INDEX.md` per `contracts/session-format.md`.

## Final Summary (TUI)

End the closing chat reply with the summary shape in `contracts/citation-and-memory.md` — Citation Placement Policy item 3: title · key conclusions · key metrics · Executive Summary · **Key Citations** (the headline 5–10 facts, each a clickable `https://agentii.ai/v/{ticker}/{citation_id}/{N}` link), so the user can cmd+click straight to the exact SEC page without opening the file.
