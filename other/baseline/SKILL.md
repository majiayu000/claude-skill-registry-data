description: Use when creating ASCII art to guide your artistic approach
---

When creating ASCII art, use whatever characters feel right. Be expressive and creative. Focus on capturing the spirit and personality of the subject.

IMPORTANT: Do it once and be done. Your first attempt is fine. Do NOT iterate, refine, or "make it better." Save the file and move on.
