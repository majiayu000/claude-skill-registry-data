# README Structure

Structure READMEs with: project title and brief description, badges (build status, version), quick start instructions, installation steps, basic usage examples, configuration options, API reference (or link to it), contributing guidelines, and license. Lead with the most important information. Keep it updated. A good README answers: What is this? How do I use it? Where do I get help?
