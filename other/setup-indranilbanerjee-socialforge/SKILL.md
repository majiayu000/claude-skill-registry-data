# /socialforge:setup — API Credential Configuration

One-time setup that stores credentials persistently. Run once, works forever across all sessions.

## Context efficiency

Asset-heavy skill. **Grep before Read** the asset catalog (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/socialforge/brands/<brand>/asset-index.json`) — never list the asset directory. Reference generated images / videos by path, not by loading metadata. Brand profile loads once per session.

## What This Does

Configures two services that SocialForge needs for creative production:

1. **Google Cloud Vertex AI** (required for images) — the image models, resolved at run time from the registry aliases `latest-image-balanced-google` and `latest-image-google`
2. **WaveSpeed** (required for video) — image-to-video, resolved from the registry alias `latest-video-wavespeed`

## Prerequisites

Your admin provides you with:
- A **Google Cloud service account JSON file** (for image generation)
- A **WaveSpeed API key** (for video generation)

If you are the admin, see the Admin Setup section below.

## How to Run

```
/socialforge:setup
```

## Interactive Flow

### Step 0: Install Dependencies (Automatic)

Run this first — installs all required Python packages:
```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/install_deps.py"
```

This auto-installs: google-genai (Vertex AI), wavespeed (video), Pillow (compositing), imageio-ffmpeg (video post-processing), playwright (carousels).

If any package fails, show the manual install command and continue.

### Step 1: Image Generation (Vertex AI)

Check if already configured:
```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/credential_manager.py" status
```

If not configured, ask:

```
Image Generation Setup (Google Cloud Vertex AI)

Do you have a Google Cloud service account JSON file?
  Provide the full file path (e.g., C:\Users\you\Downloads\socialforge-credentials.json)

Or type "skip" to configure later (image generation will not work).
```

When user provides the path:
```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/credential_manager.py" setup-vertex --json-path "<user-provided-path>"
```

Show the result. If success:
```
Image generation configured.
  Project: <project_id>
  Service Account: <email>
  Models: resolved at run time from the registry (aliases latest-image-balanced-google, latest-image-google)
```

### Step 2: Video Generation (WaveSpeed)

```
Video Generation Setup (WaveSpeed)

Do you have a WaveSpeed API key?
  Paste the key here

Or type "skip" to configure later (video generation will not work).
```

When user provides the key:
```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/credential_manager.py" setup-wavespeed --api-key "<user-provided-key>"
```

Show the result. If success:
```
Video generation configured.
  Provider: WaveSpeed (alias latest-video-wavespeed)
  Models: image-to-video, text-to-video (3-15 seconds)
```

### Step 2.5: HiggsField (Optional Fallback)

```
HiggsField Setup (Optional — adds fallback resilience)

Do you have a HiggsField API key and secret?
  → Paste the API key, then the API secret

Or type "skip" (HiggsField is optional — Vertex AI and WaveSpeed are sufficient).
```

When user provides both:
```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/credential_manager.py" setup-higgsfield --api-key "<key>" --api-secret "<secret>"
```

### Step 3: Summary

```
SocialForge API Setup Complete

  Image Generation: [configured / not configured]
    Provider: Google Cloud Vertex AI
    Project: <project_id>
    Models: registry aliases latest-image-balanced-google, latest-image-google

  Video Generation: [configured / not configured]
    Provider: WaveSpeed (alias latest-video-wavespeed)
    Modes: image-to-video, text-to-video

  HiggsField: [configured / skipped]
    Provider: HiggsField (fallback)

  Credentials stored persistently. No further setup needed.

  Next: /socialforge:brand-setup [brand-name] to configure your first brand.
```

## Admin Setup Guide

If you are setting up the cloud accounts for your team, follow these detailed guides.

### Google Cloud (Vertex AI — Image Generation)

#### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project
1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. If you don't have an account, click "Get started for free" and follow registration
3. Click the project dropdown at the top of the page (next to "Google Cloud")
4. Click "NEW PROJECT"
5. Enter a project name (e.g., "socialforge-production")
6. Click "CREATE"
7. Wait for the project to be created (30 seconds), then select it from the dropdown

#### Step 2: Enable Billing
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
2. Click "LINK A BILLING ACCOUNT"
3. If you don't have a billing account, click "CREATE BILLING ACCOUNT"
4. Add a payment method (credit card)
5. New accounts may come with promotional credits — the console states the current offer and its expiry. This skill does not quote it, because a number stated from memory is wrong the moment the vendor changes it.

#### Step 3: Enable Vertex AI API
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library
2. Search for "Vertex AI API"
3. Click on it, then click "ENABLE"
4. Wait for it to activate (takes a few seconds)

#### Step 4: Create a Service Account
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
2. Click "+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT"
3. Service account name: `socialforge-image-gen`
4. Description: `SocialForge AI image generation`
5. Click "CREATE AND CONTINUE"
6. In "Grant this service account access to project":
   - Click the "Select a role" dropdown
   - Type "Vertex AI User" in the search box
   - Select "Vertex AI User"
7. Click "CONTINUE", then "DONE"

#### Step 5: Download the JSON Key File
1. In the service accounts list, click on `socialforge-image-gen`
2. Go to the "KEYS" tab
3. Click "ADD KEY" then "Create new key"
4. Select "JSON" and click "CREATE"
5. A .json file downloads automatically — this is your credential file
6. Save it somewhere safe on your computer

#### Step 6: Share with Your Team
Share the downloaded JSON file with your team via:
- Slack DM (not in a public channel)
- Email (encrypted if possible)
- Shared company drive (restricted access)

NEVER commit this file to Git. NEVER share it publicly.

**Cost:** this skill does not state a price. Per-image cost depends on model and resolution and changes without notice, so quoting one here would be a number nobody looked up. Run `python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/price_book.py --action lookup --model <model> --provider <provider>`; it returns a recorded price or refuses with the vendor's own pricing URL. All costs go to the admin's billing account.

### WaveSpeed (Video Generation)

#### Step 1: Create a WaveSpeed Account
1. Open https://wavespeed.ai
2. Click "Sign Up" and create an account
3. Verify your email

#### Step 2: Add Credits
1. After logging in, go to your dashboard
2. Click "Top Up" or navigate to billing
3. Add credits (minimum top-up required to activate API access)
4. Pricing: read the current per-second rate from the vendor's billing page. This skill deliberately does not quote it — see `price_book.py`, which refuses to quote a price it has not looked up rather than repeating a stale one.

#### Step 3: Create an API Key
1. Go to https://wavespeed.ai/accesskey
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Copy the key (it's a long string of letters and numbers)
4. Save it somewhere safe

#### Step 4: Share with Your Team
Share the API key string with your team via:
- Slack DM
- Password manager (recommended)
- Email (encrypted if possible)

NEVER commit this key to Git or paste it in public forums.

**Cost:** All video generation costs go to the admin's WaveSpeed account. Monitor usage at https://wavespeed.ai/dashboard

### HiggsField (Optional Fallback — Video + Image)

HiggsField provides additional resilience. If both Vertex AI and WaveSpeed are down, HiggsField can generate images and videos.

#### Step 1: Create a HiggsField Account
1. Open https://higgsfield.ai
2. Click "Sign Up" and create an account
3. Any promotional credit for new accounts is shown at signup; this skill does not quote an amount.

#### Step 2: Get API Credentials
1. Log in at https://cloud.higgsfield.ai and open the API / Developer section of your dashboard
2. Create a new API key pair — you'll get an API Key AND an API Secret
3. Save both values

#### Step 3: Share with Your Team
Share both the API key AND secret with your team. Both are needed for authentication.

## Security Notes

- Credentials are stored in the plugin persistent data directory
- The GCP JSON file is copied (not linked) to ensure it survives if the original is deleted
- WaveSpeed API key is stored in credentials.json within plugin data
- No credentials are committed to git or shared outside the local machine
- To revoke access: rotate the service account key in GCP Console or regenerate the WaveSpeed API key
