description: The Socratic questioning technique that converges a vague goal — question selection, one-to-three-per-turn pacing, the reflect-every-two-answers cadence, the nine-question hard cap, and the eight-point convergence checklist that defines "converged". This is the user-facing of the brainstorm protocol's two modes — use it when the decision is the owner's to make; when it is the session's own, the mode is skill.brainstorm-internal and there is nobody to question. The protocol owns entry/exit conditions, mode selection and where output lands; this skill owns how to converge with a person.

# brainstorm-socratic

This is the mode with a person in it. It applies when the answer is the
owner's to give: what to build, for whom, what counts as done, which
tradeoff they have to live with. When the decision is the session's own,
use `docs/graph/skills/brainstorm-internal.md`;
`brainstorm.mode-selection` in `docs/graph/protocols/brainstorm.md` owns
the test.

A goal that arrives as "build me a thing" is not yet ready to specify or
plan. This skill ONLY converges the goal from vague to precise: the UI
emerges later from the user flow, and framework and architecture wait
for `architect`, after research. It is applied inside
`docs/graph/protocols/brainstorm.md`, which owns entry conditions, the
grill.md output map, and the explicit-confirmation exit; this file owns
the method.

## How to brainstorm

### Ask the smallest set of questions that change the design the most

Bad: "What colour?", "What should the homepage look like?", "What
framework?"

Good: "Who is this for and what do they do today instead?", "What counts
as success one month in?", "What is explicitly out of scope?"

Limit: one to three questions per turn, and the main flow before its
edge cases, because each set of answers reshapes the next question and
twenty questions at once get answered with platitudes.

### Reflect every two answers

After every two answers, write a one-paragraph reflection: "I now
believe X. Tell me where I'm wrong."

This forces the brainstorm to converge and lets the user disagree
precisely.

### Hard cap at nine questions total

If you haven't converged in nine questions, accept the gaps. Mark each
one as an assumption in grill.md §12, write what you have, and proceed
to `specify`.

A brainstorm that drags past nine questions is usually trying to specify
and plan at the same time. Stop; move to `specify`. Brainstorm is a
step: it converges enough to start specifying, and the spec refines
further.

## The convergence checklist

By the end of brainstorm, you can write the following without
hand-waving:

1. **Problem statement.** One sentence. "X user does Y today; we want
   them to be able to Z instead."
2. **Primary user.** A specific role and context, not "developers" or
   "users".
3. **First useful slice.** The smallest end-to-end thing that delivers
   the outcome for one well-defined case.
4. **Success criteria.** Measurable, with a time horizon. Quantitative
   where possible; qualitative with explicit rubrics where not.
5. **Non-goals.** Three to five things this is explicitly not; they are
   what holds scope.
6. **Operating constraints.** Runtime, security, privacy, data, cost,
   latency, compliance, maintenance: at least the ones that bind.
7. **Shaped options.** Two to four named technical approaches with
   one-line summaries, not full designs. Each option names the tradeoff
   it makes.
8. **Risks and assumptions.** The top three risks; every assumption
   that, if false, changes the plan.

## What the owner actually reads

Converging is half the job. The other half is that the person can tell
what they are agreeing to.

Everything this mode puts in front of the owner (the reflections, the
options, the problem statement they are asked to confirm) goes through
`docs/graph/skills/humanizer.md` as it is drafted, carrying every fact
intact.

An options table is a working artifact. A person confirming "yes, that
one" off a table has agreed to a row, not to a decision, and the
difference surfaces later as "that isn't what I thought I picked". State
what is being decided, why it is on the table now, what each option
commits them to, and what it would cost to change later. The
confirmation this mode waits for is only worth waiting for if it was
informed.
