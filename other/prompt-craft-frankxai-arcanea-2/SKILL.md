# The Arcanean Prompt Language

> *"Words shape reality. In Arcanea, we learned that the quality of your question determines the quality of your creation."*

## The Foundation: Constraint Architecture

The Arcanean Prompt Language (APL) is built on a fundamental insight: **constraints liberate creativity**. Just as a sonnet's fourteen lines produce more profound poetry than infinite freedom, structured prompts produce more powerful results.

### The Five Pillars of APL

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 ARCANEAN PROMPT                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. IDENTITY    │ Who is speaking/responding?       │
│  2. CONTEXT     │ What world does this exist in?    │
│  3. CONSTRAINT  │ What boundaries shape the work?   │
│  4. EXEMPLAR    │ What does excellence look like?   │
│  5. ITERATION   │ How will we refine together?      │

## Pillar 1: Identity Architecture

### The Voice Template
```markdown
## Voice Identity

**Name**: [Character/Role name]
**Domain**: [Area of expertise]
**Personality**: [2-3 defining traits]
**Speech Pattern**: [How they communicate]
**Core Belief**: [What drives their perspective]

**Sample Phrases**:
- "[Characteristic phrase 1]"
- "[Characteristic phrase 2]"
- "[Characteristic phrase 3]"

**Never Says**: [What would break character]
```

### Luminor Voice Patterns
Each Luminor embodies a distinct voice:

| Luminor | Voice Pattern | Sample |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Valora** | Direct imperatives | "Begin. The only failure is not starting." |
| **Sophron** | Socratic questions | "What would this look like if it were easy?" |
| **Kardia** | Emotional resonance | "What does your heart know that your mind denies?" |
| **Poiesis** | Playful experiments | "What if we tried the opposite?" |
| **Enduran** | Steady wisdom | "This too is part of the path." |
| **Orakis** | Prophetic vision | "I see where this leads..." |
| **Eudaira** | Joyful lightness | "Remember why you began this dance." |

---

## Pillar 2: Context Engineering

### The World Frame
```markdown
## Context Frame

**Setting**: [Physical/conceptual environment]
**Stakes**: [What matters and why]
**Constraints**: [Real limitations to work within]
**Resources**: [What's available to work with]
**History**: [Relevant background]
**Audience**: [Who receives this work]
```

### Context Density Levels

| Level | Token Budget | Use Case |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Minimal** | <500 | Quick queries, known domain |
| **Standard** | 500-2000 | Most creative work |
| **Rich** | 2000-5000 | Complex projects, new domains |
| **Comprehensive** | 5000+ | Novel architectures, critical work |

## Pillar 3: Constraint Design

### The Constraint Hierarchy

```
HARD CONSTRAINTS (Must follow)
├── Format requirements
├── Length limits
├── Technical specifications
└── Non-negotiables

SOFT CONSTRAINTS (Should follow)
├── Style preferences
├── Tone guidelines
└── Quality targets

CREATIVE CONSTRAINTS (Generative limits)
├── "Only using X"
├── "Never including Y"
└── "In the style of Z"
```

### The Paradox of Freedom
> *"Give me six words and I can write a novel. Give me unlimited words and I freeze."*

**Research Finding**: Optimal constraint ratio is 60-70% defined, 30-40% open.

### Constraint Templates

**The Elimination Frame**
```
Create [output] WITHOUT using:
- [Common element 1]
- [Common element 2]
- [Cliché approach]
This forces: [Novel solution]
```

**The Substitution Frame**
```
Instead of [typical approach], use [unexpected approach].
This creates: [Fresh perspective]
```

**The Combination Frame**
```
Combine [element A] with [element B] to create [new thing].
The tension produces: [Creative friction]
```

## Pillar 4: Exemplar Engineering

### The Power of Examples
Research shows: **One excellent example > Ten paragraphs of instruction**

### Exemplar Template
```markdown
## Exemplar

**Input**: [What was given]
**Process**: [What happened]
**Output**: [What was produced]
**Why It Works**: [Analysis]

---

**Anti-Exemplar** (What to avoid):
**Input**: [Same or similar input]
**Output**: [Poor result]
**Why It Fails**: [Analysis]
```

### Few-Shot Patterns

| Pattern | Structure | Best For |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Single-Shot** | 1 example | Clear, simple tasks |
| **Few-Shot** | 3-5 examples | Pattern learning |
| **Chain-of-Thought** | Examples with reasoning | Complex reasoning |
| **Contrastive** | Good + bad examples | Style refinement |

## Pillar 5: Iteration Protocols

### The Refinement Loop
```
Round 1: Generate → Evaluate → Identify gaps
Round 2: Constrain further → Regenerate → Compare
Round 3: Synthesize best elements → Polish → Finalize
```

### Iteration Commands

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| "More [quality]" | Increase specific attribute |
| "Less [quality]" | Decrease specific attribute |
| "Keep [element], change [element]" | Selective refinement |
| "5 variations on [element]" | Divergent exploration |
| "Combine best of A and B" | Convergent synthesis |
| "Push this 20% further" | Intensity dial |

### The Centaur Feedback Loop
```
Human: Provides taste, judgment, vision
   ↓
AI: Generates options, explores space
   ↓
Human: Selects, directs, refines
   ↓
AI: Iterates on selection
   ↓
Human: Final curation and polish
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Meta-Prompting
Ask the AI to help design the prompt:
```
"I want to achieve [outcome]. Help me design a prompt that would
produce excellent results. Consider what context, constraints,
and examples would be most effective."
```

### 2. Persona Stacking
Combine multiple perspectives:
```
"Respond as if you were a collaboration between:
- A master storyteller (narrative)
- A cognitive scientist (psychology)
- A poet (language)
Each perspective should inform the others."
```

### 3. Temporal Framing
Shift time perspective:
```
"Write this as if it's already been successful and you're
explaining how it was done."

"Write this from the perspective of someone who solved
this problem years ago."
```

### 4. The Negative Space Technique
Define by what's absent:
```
"Create [thing] that is notably NOT:
- [Common approach 1]
- [Common approach 2]
The absence of these creates space for [innovation]."
```

### 5. Escalating Constraints
Progressive narrowing:
```
Round 1: "Write a story about loss" (open)
Round 2: "In exactly 100 words" (length)
Round 3: "Using only dialogue" (format)
Round 4: "Between a parent and child" (characters)
Round 5: "About an object, not a person" (twist)
```

## Quality Indicators

### Signs of a Strong Prompt
- [ ] Clear identity/role definition
- [ ] Specific context with stakes
- [ ] Balanced constraints (not too many, not too few)
- [ ] At least one concrete example
- [ ] Explicit success criteria
- [ ] Room for iteration

### Signs of a Weak Prompt
- [ ] Vague or missing role
- [ ] Generic or absent context
- [ ] No constraints (infinite freedom)
- [ ] No examples
- [ ] Unclear what "good" looks like
- [ ] One-shot expectation

## The Prompt Sage's Final Wisdom

> *"The master prompter knows that every prompt is a collaboration. You bring the vision, the constraints, the taste. The AI brings the exploration, the patterns, the generation. Neither alone creates what both together can achieve."*

### The Three Laws of Arcanean Prompting

1. **Constraint Liberates**: More structure → More creativity
2. **Examples Teach**: Show, don't just tell
3. **Iteration Refines**: First draft is never final
