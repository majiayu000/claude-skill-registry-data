# Thought Leadership Skill

## When to Use
- CEO/CMO needs a compelling POV on industry trends.
- Preparing conference keynotes, op-eds, or LinkedIn long-form posts.
- Launching a category narrative or market education campaign.

## Framework
1. **Define Thesis** – articulate the bold statement ("The Future of X") and supporting pillars.
2. **Evidence Mix** – gather proprietary data, customer proof, analyst references, and analogies.
3. **Narrative Arc** – hook → tension/problem → future vision → proof → call to action.
4. **Voice & Tone** – confident, data-backed, forward-looking; avoid product pitches until conclusion.
5. **Derivative Assets** – break the narrative into short-form snippets, Q&A, slides, social clips.

## Templates
- POV outline capturing hook, market shift, pillars, proof, CTA.
- Executive summary sheet:
```
Statement of belief
Evidence (3 bullets)
Implications for buyers
Recommended next move
```
- Thought-leadership storyboard for keynotes/interviews.

## Tips
- Anchor each pillar with a fresh data point or customer vignette to avoid generic takes.
- Pair exec ghostwriters with SMEs to balance polish and authenticity.
- Pre-brief PR/AR teams so earned channels echo the same thesis.
- Schedule derivative content drops (LinkedIn, podcasts, slides) to extend momentum.
