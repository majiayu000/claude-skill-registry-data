# Deal Review Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing for forecast calls or executive deal reviews.
- Coaching reps on qualification, mutual action plans, or competitive positioning.
- Validating whether key deals deserve exec/CS/partner resources.

## Framework
1. **Qualification Pulse** – confirm MEDDIC/BANT elements, economic buyer access, and champion strength.
2. **Stakeholder Map** – document buying committee roles, influencers, and gaps.
3. **Mutual Action Plan** – outline critical path milestones, owners, and risk mitigations.
4. **Competitive/Value Story** – identify differentiators, landmines, and proof required.
5. **Next Actions** – lock committed next steps, deadlines, and owners directly in CRM.

## Templates
- Deal review worksheet (qualification, risks, next steps).
- Mutual action plan table with milestones and RACI.
- Competitive battlecard snippet for in-call reference.

## Tips
- Capture notes directly in CRM to keep pipeline data aligned with conversations.
- Invite cross-functional partners (SE, CS, exec sponsor) when blockers require their involvement.
- Pair with `forecast-discipline` to ensure inspection outcomes feed into commit grading.
