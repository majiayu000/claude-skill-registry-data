# Competitor Audit

Analyze competitor advertising strategy for competitive intelligence using systematic research across platforms.

## Core Philosophy

"Do not reinvent the wheel. You need to always build off inspiration." The goal is not to copy, but to understand what's working and why, then apply those principles to your own offer.

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Competitors

Using brand info and keywords, categorize competitors:

**Direct Competitors**
- Same product category
- Competing for identical customers
- Similar price points

**Indirect Competitors**
- Same avatar, different product
- Solving adjacent problems
- Alternative solutions to same desire

**Market Leaders to Study**
- Big brands in e-com regardless of industry
- Innovation leaders setting trends
- Keep finger on pulse of what's working at scale

**Search Methods**
1. Google search with relevant keywords - see who's running ads
2. TikTok search - powerful search engine with user data
3. Facebook Ad Library search by keyword and brand
4. VidTao for YouTube ads

### Step 2: Facebook Ad Library Deep Dive

**Initial Research**
1. Navigate to facebook.com/ads/library
2. Search brand name or relevant keywords
3. Set filters:
   - Status: Active ads only
   - Country: Target market
   - Platform: All (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Audience Network)
   - Media type: All or video specifically

**Finding Winners**
- Sort by "Oldest first" - longest-running ads are proven performers
- Multiple variations of same concept = actively testing/scaling
- Consistent themes over time = core messaging that works
- High number of active ads = significant spend level

**What to Document**
For each promising ad:
- Screenshot/download the creative
- Note the start date (runtime indicator)
- Count variations (indicates investment level)
- Identify platform placements

**Reading Between the Lines**
- 3+ months running = likely profitable
- 10+ variations = scaling aggressively
- Same hook across variations = winning hook identified
- Same offer structure = proven conversion mechanism

### Step 3: TikTok Top Ads Research

TikTok Top Ads is a powerful ideation tool even for Facebook/YouTube advertising. The psychological triggers that work on TikTok work everywhere.

**Accessing TikTok Top Ads**
1. Go to TikTok Creative Center / Top Ads
2. Filter by:
   - Region: Target market
   - Industry: Your industry (and adjacent industries for cross-industry research)
   - Objective: Conversions
   - Time period: Last 7 days, 30 days

**What to Analyze**
- Trending formats and styles
- Hook patterns that stop scroll
- Native content styles (not polished/produced)
- Engagement patterns in comments

**Key Insight**
"Just because the style or the medium of communication is changing doesn't mean that the core psychological desires of why people buy are changing on the platform. They are not. At all."

If you understand WHY an ad works on TikTok, you can translate that to any channel by fitting it into that channel's medium.

### Step 4: Categorize Ads by Components

**Angle Analysis**
- Problem-agitation: Highlighting pain points
- Solution-focused: Leading with the answer
- Testimonial/story: Customer transformation
- Demo/proof: Showing it in action
- Authority/expert: Credibility building
- Offer/deal: Value proposition lead

**Framework Identification**
Common winning structures:
- Hook + testimonial + CTA
- Problem + mechanism + proof
- Story arc (before/during/after)
- Listicle/reasons ("3 ways...")
- We've Been Lying to You format
- Cliffhanger format

**Direct Response Principles Present**
- **Intensification**: Putting a claim into action in a clear, concise way
- **Authority**: Expert approval or authority figure ownership
- **Mass Desire**: Tapping into instinct, problem, education, or trend reversal
- **LFA Core Desires**: Life Force 8 desires (survival, food, freedom from fear, sexual companionship, comfortable living, superiority, protection of loved ones, social approval)
- **Fear Factor**: Consequence of inaction
- **Belief Ranking**: Challenging existing beliefs
- **Social Proof**: Bandwagon effect
- **Ego Morphing**: Identity transformation
- **Anchoring**: Price/value comparison

### Step 5: Extract Components

**Hooks (First 3 Seconds)**
Document the five hook types:
1. **Greed**: Money, checks, bank receipts, savings
2. **Relevancy**: Seasonal, trending events, current news
3. **Emotions**: Reactions, surprises, emotional moments
4. **Demographics**: Calling out specific groups (renters, seniors, moms)
5. **Cliffhangers**: Unresolved tension, outcome held until end

**Body Elements**
- Proof types used (testimonials, demos, before/after)
- B-roll style (native iPhone vs produced)
- Explainer methods
- Social proof presentation

**CTAs**
- Call to action language
- Urgency/scarcity tactics
- Risk reversal offers
- Story-based CTAs (mini testimonial)

**Offers**
- Pricing structure
- Bonuses/gifts
- Guarantees
- Deadline/scarcity mechanics

## Research Tips

**Finding Winners**
- Longest-running ads = proven performers with spend behind them
- Multiple variations of same concept = actively testing/scaling
- Consistent themes across time = core messaging that converts
- Same creator across multiple ads = working relationship worth noting

**What to Look For**
- Hooks that stop scroll (first 3 seconds)
- Proof types that build belief (not just show features)
- Offer structures that remove friction
- Creative formats (static/video/carousel) and which perform
- Native vs produced style (native usually wins)

**Cross-Platform Intelligence**
- Check TikTok Creative Center for any brand
- YouTube ad transparency / VidTao
- Native ad spy tools
- Instagram Reels for organic content that inspires ads

**Reading the Data**
- Competitor research is less about finding inspiration
- More about creating a baseline for angles, styles, and messaging in the marketplace
- Understand what's already being said to your audience
- Find the gaps and opportunities

## The 80/20 Rule

Focus your analysis on:
- Top 20% longest-running ads (proven)
- Ads with most variations (actively scaling)
- Hooks that appear across multiple competitors (industry-proven)
- Offers that persist over time (converting)
