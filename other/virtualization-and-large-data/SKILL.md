# Virtualization and Large Data (React 18)

## Summary

Implement high-performance virtualization strategies for massive datasets without sacrificing UX.

## Key Capabilities

- Build windowing systems with smooth scrolling and overscan.
- Coordinate virtualization with concurrent rendering and transitions.
- Optimize layout recalculations with memoized measurements.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Model virtualization accuracy vs performance trade-offs.
- Evaluate scroll-jank using real-user traces.
- Integrate virtualization with accessibility requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Demonstrate stable scrolling at 60 FPS for large lists.
- Provide performance metrics and jank analysis.
- Document accessibility strategy for virtualized content.
