# mcp-protocol Stinger

Procedural arsenal for `mcp-protocol-wasp-drone`, the MCP protocol authority for The Wasp Nest.

This stinger encodes the reference material needed to build and audit **any** MCP server's protocol correctness and tool contract against the MCP specification, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (or an equivalent), and JSON-RPC 2.0 - plus how to register a server in each of the four harnesses The Wasp Nest supports. It is organized around general, server-agnostic guides (00-08), a fully worked example applied to one real server (09, the Wasp Nestmind agent-memory server this pair originally shipped for), templates for common deliverables, and worked examples for frequent tasks.

**Paired Drone:** `../../agents/mcp-protocol-wasp-drone.md`

## First action when this stinger is loaded

Read these in order before doing anything:

1. **`guides/00-principles.md`** - spec-first reasoning; tool idempotency + side-effect declaration; tools vs resources vs prompts; JSON-RPC error-code honesty. This is the foundation every other guide builds on.
2. The guide most relevant to the current task (see index below).

Then pick the appropriate template from `templates/` for the deliverable the Drone is producing. If the server under review is Hivemind specifically, also read `guides/09-hivemind-worked-example.md` for the concrete, ground-truthed version of every rule.

## Guide index

| Guide | Topic | When to open |
|---|---|---|
| `guides/00-principles.md` | Spec-first reasoning; idempotency; tools vs resources vs prompts; error-code honesty | Every invocation |
| `guides/01-transport.md` | stdio vs Streamable HTTP; stdio hygiene; when a transport change is really an auth-model change | Transport-choice questions; "stdio or HTTP?" |
| `guides/02-tool-resource-prompt-design.md` | Tool vs resource vs prompt; anatomy of a well-formed tool; content types and output schemas | Designing or auditing a tool; "tool or resource?" |
| `guides/03-zod-schemas.md` | zod input schemas; the versioned zod v3/v4 SDK-compatibility trap | Schema authoring; "why is the schema empty?"; "why does zod v4 break the schema?" |
| `guides/04-error-model.md` | Two failure channels; JSON-RPC codes; classifying raw backend errors | Error reviews; "what code do I return?" |
| `guides/05-capability-negotiation.md` | initialize/discovery lifecycle; capabilities as a contract; deprecated primitives | Handshake questions; capability mismatches |
| `guides/06-authentication.md` | Auth patterns for remote/HTTP servers: API keys, bearer tokens, OAuth 2.1 | "How do I add auth to my MCP server?"; auditing a remote server's auth boundary |
| `guides/07-testing-mcp.md` | Layered testing model (protocol, unit, integration, tool-selection, transport); the boundary-mock pattern | Writing or auditing MCP tests |
| `guides/08-harness-registration.md` | Registering a server in Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Cowork; the Codex TOML trap; Cowork's public-reachability constraint | "Register this MCP server in \<harness\>" |
| `guides/09-hivemind-worked-example.md` | Every principle above, applied concretely to the Wasp Nestmind server | Auditing Hivemind specifically; wanting a full worked example |

---

## Template index

| Template | Use when |
|---|---|
| `templates/findings-report.md` | Producing the MCP server / tool audit findings report |
| `templates/tool-contract-checklist.md` | Evaluating whether a tool is well-formed and contract-stable |
| `templates/error-channel-matrix.md` | Routing a failure to the correct channel (JSON-RPC error vs tool result) |
| `templates/transport-decision.md` | Choosing stdio vs HTTP, or diagnosing stdio hygiene |

---

## Example index

| Example | Shows |
|---|---|
| `examples/add-hivemind-tool.md` | Add a new `hivemind_*` tool with a zod/v3 schema, matching the Wasp Nestmind worked example's contract |
| `examples/expose-a-resource.md` | Expose a stable document as an MCP resource (the tool-vs-resource decision) |
| `examples/test-mcp-tool.md` | Test an MCP tool with the Vitest boundary-mock pattern |

These worked examples are grounded in the Wasp Nestmind codebase (see `guides/09-hivemind-worked-example.md`); the design decisions they walk through generalize per `guides/00-08`.

---

## Critical directives (lifted from Command Brief)

- **Cite the spec section or SDK symbol for every ruling.** Why: it is the only way the developer can verify the ruling and learn the principle, not just take the Drone's word.
- **Never conflate the JSON-RPC error channel with the tool-result channel.** Why: dressing a protocol fault as a success (or vice versa) is the MCP analog of HTTP "200 with error body" and poisons the agent's context.
- **The zod import at the SDK boundary MUST be `zod/v3`.** Why: the SDK generates tool JSON Schemas against v3 internals; v4 produces a wrong/empty schema and breaks param validation.
- **Treat tool names + arg shapes + parseable output as a cross-harness contract.** Why: Hermes, OpenClaw, pi, Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor all depend on them; a rename is breaking, not a refactor.
- **Do not audit Deeplake credential/OAuth lifecycle** - hand off to `security-wasp-drone`. **Do not audit Deeplake query/schema internals** - hand off to `vector-store-wasp-drone`.

## Scope note: general MCP work vs the Wasp Nestmind worked example

This pair originally shipped scoped to one product (Hivemind, an npm-distributed agent-memory MCP server: tools `hivemind_search`/`hivemind_read`/`hivemind_index`, Deep Lake credentials, a `mcp/bundle` build output). It has been broadened to cover building and auditing MCP servers **generally** - any tool/resource/prompt design question, any zod schema question, any transport or auth or testing or harness-registration question applies to any MCP server, not just Hivemind's. The Wasp Nestmind material was not deleted: it is preserved in full as `guides/09-hivemind-worked-example.md`, a clearly labeled worked example showing every general principle applied to one real, shipped server. Use guides 00-08 for anything general; use guide 09 when the server actually under review is Hivemind, or when you want to see the general rules exercised end to end.
