name: kleros-curate
description: "Interact with Kleros Curate registries across Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, and Sepolia. Use when the user mentions Curate, Light Curate/LightGeneralizedTCR/LGTCR, Stake Curate/PermanentGTCR/PGTCR, Scout, token-curated registry/TCR, token lists, address/CDN tags, Goldsky, MetaEvidence, Verify Your List, or Curate calls such as addItem, removeItem, challengeItem, challengeRequest, and fundAppeal. Covers registry discovery and queries; policy/schema inspection; submissions, removals, challenges, evidence, appeals, rewards, execution; factory deployment; and frontend verification on all three networks. Also trigger for registry/list operations paired with Kleros, arbitrator, dispute, juror, or PNK context, and whenever the user names or tests kleros-curate. Do NOT use for non-Kleros registries or generic IPFS uploads without Curate context; route standalone uploads to kleros-ipfs-upload."

# Kleros Curate

Kleros Curate is a decentralized verification system for exclusive, policy-driven registries. Registries are
governed by a policy document stored on IPFS — every submission is judged against that policy, and jurors
consult it if a dispute arises.

**The deposit/challenge/arbitration cycle:**

1. A submitter proposes an item and locks a submission deposit as a pledge that the item complies with the
   registry policy.
2. The item enters a challenge window (configurable per registry, typically days to weeks). Anyone can review
   submissions during this window.
3. If nobody challenges within the window, the item is accepted and the submitter's deposit is returned in
   full — compliant submissions carry no permanent inclusion cost.
4. If a challenger believes the submission violates the policy, they lock a challenge deposit and open a
   Kleros dispute. Impartial Kleros jurors read the policy and render a verdict.
5. The winner captures the loser's deposit as a bounty. The two-sided stake mechanism rewards accuracy and
   discourages frivolous challenges in both directions.

**Why use Curate:**

- **Earn by curating**: users can profit by finding non-compliant entries in challengeable registries. In
  Stake Curate especially, successful challengers can recover their challenge deposit and win the item's stake.
- **Launch your own verification market**: projects can create a Curate list for almost any verifiable
  standard, define their own policy, deposits, challenge windows, arbitrator/court, and governance. The result
  is a fast, low-overhead registry that can power a public Curate view or a custom frontend.

**Why onchain-first matters:**

Deposit amounts, arbitration costs, MetaEvidence URIs, and challenge windows are all live onchain state —
they change when registry governors update parameters. Any cached or estimated value is a liability: an agent
that submits the wrong deposit amount will have its transaction revert. Always read live values before acting.

**Three contract flavors:**

- **Light Curate (LGTCR)** — `LightGeneralizedTCR`: optimistic challenge window, native-token deposits, the most
  widely deployed flavor. Used by the majority of Curate registries across Ethereum, Gnosis, and Sepolia.
- **Stake Curate (PGTCR)** — `PermanentGTCR`: permanent ERC20 stake (not returned on item removal),
  Goldsky subgraph as primary data source, different status model (Submitted / Reincluded / Disputed / Absent
  + withdrawal flow). Identified by PGTCR-specific hallmark read calls (see `references/stake-curate.md`).
- **Scout** — LGTCR contracts on Gnosis, specialized for 4 well-known registries (contract address tags,
  token lists, address tags, CDN mappings). Scout IS an overlay on LGTCR — it is not a separate contract
  type. Working with Scout always requires both `references/scout-registries.md` (Scout-specific context)
  and `references/light-curate.md` (LGTCR contract operations).

## Non-negotiables

These rules apply across all Curate flavors. They are always in context; reference files may not repeat them.

- **Never guess / invent / approximate** amounts, addresses, schemas, or parameters.
- **Onchain state + onchain logs are the source of truth** for deposits, arbitration cost, challenge deposits, appeal status, and MetaEvidence URI.
- **Never assume a "standard token schema"** — only the current MetaEvidence for that registry is authoritative.
- **Never rewrite the schema**: `item.json.columns` must be copied verbatim from MetaEvidence; only `values` is dynamic.
- **Never upload or submit half-baked artifacts**: no malformed JSON, broken MetaEvidence, placeholder values, unsupported field types, or unreachable policy files.
- **Never author unsupported MetaEvidence field types**: for URL fields use `type: "link"`, not `url`; validate every `metadata.columns[].type` before upload.
- **Production registries need a logo**: do not deploy a production list with missing `metadata.logoURI`.
- **Strongly prefer PDF policy documents** for registry policies. Use a non-PDF policy only after the user
  explicitly accepts the review and compatibility risk.
- **Never include "typical ranges" or estimates** for deposits or fees — only report live-read values.
- **`eth_getCode` before declaring any address is or isn't a contract.**

## Which Curate flavor are you using?

**Step 1 — Keyword scan (zero cost)**

- Mentions "Verify Your List", list verification, list-of-lists, frontend visibility, or making a deployed
  registry discoverable
  → **Verification target is Light Curate (LGTCR)** on all three supported networks
  → Read `references/verify-your-list.md` AND `references/light-curate.md`; do not ask the generic flavor
  question for the verification target. Detect the flavor of the registry being listed separately only when
  the live verification policy makes it relevant.

- Mentions "Scout", "token list", "address tags", "CDN"
  → **Scout** (overlay on Light Curate — LGTCR contracts on Gnosis)
  → Read `references/scout-registries.md` AND `references/light-curate.md` (both required; Scout adds context on top of LGTCR operations)

- Mentions "PGTCR", "Stake Curate", "PermanentGTCR", "Goldsky"
  → **Stake Curate (PGTCR)**
  → Read `references/stake-curate.md`

- Mentions "Curate", "LGTCR", "LightGeneralizedTCR", "Light Curate", "addItem", "registry", or no flavor hint
  → **Light Curate (LGTCR)** (also the default)
  → Read `references/light-curate.md`

**Step 2 — Ambiguous ("Curate" with no flavor hint)**

- **Interactive session**: ask one question — "Which Curate flavor? Light Curate (optimistic challenge window, native-token deposits), Stake Curate (permanent ERC20 stake, Goldsky subgraph), or Scout (4 Gnosis registries for contract/token tagging)?"

- **One-shot / non-interactive**: default to Light Curate, then progressively correct:
  - If user provides a contract address: check if it matches one of the 4 known Scout registry addresses → load Scout overlay (read `references/scout-registries.md` AND `references/light-curate.md`)
  - If contract introspection reveals PGTCR hallmarks → pivot to Stake Curate (read `references/stake-curate.md` for hallmark calls)
  - Otherwise: proceed as Light Curate

**Step 3 — Contract-type verification (if address provided)**

See the flavor reference file for hallmark calls — SKILL.md does not embed function signatures here (contract-type detection belongs in each flavor's reference file).

## Action index

**Submit item to a registry** → `references/light-curate.md` (LGTCR) or `references/stake-curate.md` (PGTCR)

**Challenge / remove an item** → flavor reference file

**Submit evidence** → flavor reference file

**Fund an appeal** → flavor reference file

**Deploy a new registry (factory)** → flavor reference file (factory section)

**Fetch MetaEvidence (policy + schema)** → `references/shared-metaevidence.md`

**Compute deposits** → `references/shared-deposits.md`

**Build item.json** → `references/shared-item-json.md`

**Verify / make a deployed list visible on the Curate frontend** -> `references/verify-your-list.md`

**Upload to IPFS** → `references/shared-ipfs-upload.md`

**ABI / function signatures** → `references/shared-abi-fragments.md`
  grep: `grep -n "function\|event" references/shared-abi-fragments.md`

**Scout registry addresses + seed templates** → `references/scout-registries.md`
  grep: `grep -n "0x\|ATQ\|Address Tags\|Tokens\|CDN" references/scout-registries.md`

## Common workflows

**Submit an item (any flavor):**
1. `references/shared-metaevidence.md` — fetch schema (columns) and policy URI
2. `references/shared-item-json.md` — build the item.json payload
3. `references/shared-ipfs-upload.md` — upload item.json to IPFS, get CID
4. `references/shared-deposits.md` — compute exact msg.value
5. Flavor reference (`light-curate.md` or `stake-curate.md`) — send the addItem transaction

**Challenge or remove an item:**
1. `references/shared-metaevidence.md` — fetch the applicable policy (clearing policy for removal; registration policy for challenge)
2. `references/shared-ipfs-upload.md` — upload evidence JSON to IPFS
3. `references/shared-deposits.md` — compute the challenge deposit
4. Flavor reference — send the challenge or removeItem transaction

**Deploy a new registry:**
1. `references/shared-metaevidence.md` - prepare valid MetaEvidence JSON (policy URI + column schema + logoURI)
2. `references/shared-ipfs-upload.md` — upload MetaEvidence JSON to IPFS
3. `references/shared-abi-fragments.md` - get known factory/arbitrator addresses and deploy ABI
4. Flavor reference — call the factory deploy function
5. `references/verify-your-list.md` - submit the new registry to the network's list-of-lists if frontend visibility is required

**Frontend visibility after deployment:**
- Deploying a registry does not automatically make it visible on the Curate frontend.
- Verifying a list gives it more visibility, makes it findable in the frontend, and marks it as a listed
  registry for users.
- List-of-lists submission is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended for public registries. Skip it only
  when the list is intentionally stealth/private.
- On Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, and Sepolia, the canonical verification registries are Light Curate.
  Use `references/verify-your-list.md` for the chain-specific addresses and verification safeguards, then
  follow the standard LGTCR submission workflow. The registry being listed may be another Curate flavor if
  the live verification policy permits it.

## Reference files

These 9 files are loaded on demand — only when needed for the current task. The action index above points
to the right file for each operation. Loading an unnecessary reference file wastes context.

**`references/light-curate.md`**
Light Curate (LightGeneralizedTCR) operations end-to-end: minimum inputs to ask the user, registry
discovery via `eth_getCode` and hallmark reads, MetaEvidence retrieval, item.json construction, submit
item, challenge / remove item, submit evidence, fund an appeal, deploy a new registry via factory.
Read this file for any LGTCR contract interaction — and always alongside `references/scout-registries.md`
when working on Scout.

**`references/stake-curate.md`**
Stake Curate (PermanentGTCR) operations end-to-end: PGTCR hallmark detection (distinguishes PGTCR from
LGTCR), ERC20 approval + stake deposit flow, Goldsky subgraph as primary MetaEvidence source with onchain
fallback, PGTCR status model (Submitted / Reincluded / Disputed / Absent), item withdrawal flow, deploy
factory. Read this file for any PGTCR contract interaction.

**`references/scout-registries.md`**
Scout-specific overlay for the 4 known Gnosis registries (Tokens / Address Tags / Contract Domain Names /
CDN). Contains: the 4 registry contract addresses used for address-based routing, seed-first submission
pattern (fill from existing seed template, then submit), item.json templates per registry, image guidance,
incentives information. Always read alongside `references/light-curate.md` — Scout IS LGTCR at the
contract layer; this file adds Scout-only context on top.

**`references/verify-your-list.md`**
Three-network workflow for making a deployed registry visible and verified in the Curate frontend. Contains
the canonical Ethereum Mainnet, Gnosis Chain, and Sepolia `LightGeneralizedTCR` verification addresses,
keeps the transaction target distinct from the registry being listed, and delegates to the standard LGTCR
MetaEvidence, item.json, IPFS, deposit, simulation, and request-finalization procedures.

**`references/shared-metaevidence.md`**
Shared MetaEvidence retrieval applicable to all Curate flavors: `eth_getLogs` method with the correct
topic0, latest applicable MetaEvidence selection, LGTCR registration-vs-clearing classification, Goldsky
subgraph path for PGTCR, MetaEvidence JSON structure, policy URI extraction, and MetaEvidence authoring
guardrails.
Read this file before fetching MetaEvidence for any registry, regardless of flavor.

**`references/shared-deposits.md`**
Shared deposit computation covering all Curate flavors: submission deposit formula for LGTCR, challenge
deposit formula for LGTCR, PGTCR stake vs arbitration deposit distinction (ERC20 stake is separate from
the native-token arbitration cost), `arbitrationCost()` read pattern, `msg.value` assembly rule.
Read this file before computing any deposit or constructing any transaction value.

**`references/shared-item-json.md`**
Strict item.json construction rules: the `columns + values` schema format, verbatim-copy rule for columns
(copy from MetaEvidence without modification - values is the only dynamic part), GTCR field type allowlist,
forbidden aliases, placeholder rejection, pre-upload validation, and `NewItem` event sampling to verify
field order before submitting. Read this file before building any item payload for any Curate registry.

**`references/shared-abi-fragments.md`**
Shared ABI fragments for all Curate contracts: `LightGeneralizedTCR` read and write function signatures,
`PermanentGTCR` read and write function signatures, `IArbitrator` interface ABI, key event signatures
(`MetaEvidence`, `ItemStatusChange`, `RequestSubmitted`, etc.), known LightGTCRFactory addresses, and known
Kleros V1 arbitrator addresses. Use `grep -n "function\|event\|address"` to
navigate this file. Read when you need function selectors, calldata encoding, or event topic hashes.

**`references/shared-ipfs-upload.md`**
Shared IPFS upload guidance for Curate workflows: durability rationale (external pins can disappear after
onchain anchoring), required recommended path via the `kleros-ipfs-upload` skill and Kleros x402 endpoint,
`/ipfs/<CID>` format rule (avoid double-slash when building URLs), and explicit risk warning for any
user-approved external pinning source.
Read before any IPFS upload step inside a Curate workflow.
