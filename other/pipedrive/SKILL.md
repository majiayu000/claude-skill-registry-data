# Pipedrive  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `pipedrive-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/pipedrive/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/pipedrive/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `pipedrive-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `pipedrive-cli` and `pipedrive-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Existing Pipedrive CLIs and MCP servers are thin mirrors of the REST API  -  none keep a local copy of your pipeline, so none can tell you which deals are going stale, what your weighted forecast is, who's aging in a stage, or where your duplicate contacts are. This CLI syncs the whole deal-person-org-activity graph into local SQLite with full-text search, then adds the cross-entity intelligence layer on top: stale, forecast, aging, digest, changes, dupes, and leaderboard. Plus an offline `search`, offline `analytics` (count and group-by over synced data), and agent-native `--json`/`--select`/`--csv` on every command.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this CLI when an agent or operator needs to reason about a Pipedrive pipeline as a dataset rather than poke individual records: morning triage of stale deals, weekly weighted forecasting and per-rep leaderboards, deduping contacts, scripting incremental change feeds, or running offline analytics over the synced CRM. It is the right tool whenever the question spans many deals, a time window, or several entities at once  -  the cases a single REST call can't answer.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Fuzzy text lookup across many records to find an entity  -  use the 'search' command (or the API search endpoints), not 'who'.
- Live per-record reads that must reflect this second's CRM state  -  the novel commands read the local synced store; run 'sync' first or use the generated endpoint commands.
- Pipeline analytics before a first 'sync --full'  -  every local-join command (stale, forecast, aging, digest, changes, dupes, leaderboard, next-activity, lost, who) returns empty counts on an unsynced store.
- Sending email or managing Pipedrive automations/workflows  -  not part of this CLI's surface.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Pipeline intelligence (local-join)
- **`stale`**  -  List open deals nobody has touched in N days, ranked by the dollar value at risk.

  _Reach for this every morning to catch the deals silently dying before they're lost  -  the highest-leverage read in the whole CLI._

  ```bash
  pipedrive-cli stale --quiet-days 14 --agent
  ```
- **`forecast`**  -  Weighted pipeline value (deal value times stage probability) by pipeline, plus what is expected to close this period.

  _Use this for weekly pipeline review instead of exporting CSVs and rebuilding the weighted-value math by hand._

  ```bash
  pipedrive-cli forecast --period this-quarter --agent
  ```
- **`aging`**  -  Show which deals are stuck in a stage longer than that stage's typical dwell time.

  _Reach for this to find the bottleneck stage and the specific deals rotting in it before a pipeline review._

  ```bash
  pipedrive-cli aging --agent
  ```
- **`leaderboard`**  -  Per-rep open/won/lost counts, weighted pipeline, won value, and activity count over a window.

  _Use this for team reviews to rank reps by real contribution without touching a spreadsheet._

  ```bash
  pipedrive-cli leaderboard --by won-value --window 90d --agent
  ```
- **`next-activity`**  -  List open deals with no future activity scheduled, ranked by the value at risk of falling through the cracks.

  _Run this daily to catch the deals you forgot to plan a next step for  -  distinct from stale, which catches deals you have not touched._

  ```bash
  pipedrive-cli next-activity --missing --agent
  ```
- **`lost`**  -  All deals marked Lost in a recent window with their person, org, owner, and lost reason  -  ready for re-enrollment.

  _Use this to build a re-engagement campaign from deals lost in a window, with contact info and lost reasons already joined in._

  ```bash
  pipedrive-cli lost --since 180d --agent
  ```
- **`who`**  -  One-shot card for a person: their org, open deals and value, last and next activity, and recent notes  -  joined from the local store.

  _Reach for this before a call to get the full relationship picture of one contact in a single command instead of five lookups._

  ```bash
  pipedrive-cli who "Jane Smith" --agent
  ```

### Standup & change tracking
- **`digest`**  -  One-shot standup rollup: new deals since yesterday, deals gone stale today, overdue and due-today activities, and deals won or lost since.

  _Run this first thing  -  it answers 'what changed and who do I need to call today' in one command._

  ```bash
  pipedrive-cli digest --for-me --agent
  ```
- **`changes`**  -  Everything whose update time moved since a timestamp, grouped by entity.

  _Use this in scripts to process only what changed since the last run instead of re-paging the whole API._

  ```bash
  pipedrive-cli changes --since 24h --agent
  ```

### Data hygiene
- **`dupes`**  -  Find likely-duplicate persons or organizations by normalized name, email, and phone.

  _Reach for this to clean up the duplicate contacts that integrations quietly create._

  ```bash
  pipedrive-cli dupes --entity persons --agent
  ```

## Command Reference

**activities**  -  Activities are appointments/tasks/events on a calendar that can be associated with a deal, a lead, a person and an organization. Activities can be of different type (such as call, meeting, lunch or a custom type - see ActivityTypes object) and can be assigned to a particular user. Note that activities can also be created without a specific date/time.

- `pipedrive-cli activities add`  -  Adds a new activitie. (Restored core v1 create endpoint.)
- `pipedrive-cli activities delete`  -  Marks a activitie as deleted. (Restored core v1 delete endpoint.)
- `pipedrive-cli activities get`  -  Returns the details of a specific activitie. (Restored core v1 detail endpoint.)
- `pipedrive-cli activities get-all`  -  Returns all activities. (Restored core v1 list endpoint.)
- `pipedrive-cli activities update`  -  Updates the properties of a activitie. (Restored core v1 update endpoint.)

**activity-fields**  -  Activity fields represent different fields that an activity has.

- `pipedrive-cli activity-fields`  -  Returns all activity fields.

**activity-types**  -  Activity types represent different kinds of activities that can be stored. Each activity type is presented to the user with an icon and a name. Additionally, a color can be defined (not implemented in the Pipedrive app as of today). Activity types are linked to activities via `ActivityType.key_string = Activity.type`. The `key_string` will be generated by the API based on the given name of the activity type upon creation, and cannot be changed. Activity types should be presented to the user in an ordered manner, using the `ActivityType.order_nr` value.

- `pipedrive-cli activity-types add`  -  Adds a new activity type.
- `pipedrive-cli activity-types delete`  -  Marks an activity type as deleted.
- `pipedrive-cli activity-types get`  -  Returns all activity types.
- `pipedrive-cli activity-types update`  -  Updates an activity type.

**billing**  -  Billing is responsible for handling your subscriptions, payments, plans and add-ons.

- `pipedrive-cli billing`  -  Returns the add-ons for a single company.

**call-logs**  -  Call logs describe the outcome of a phone call managed by an integrated provider. Since these logs are also considered activities, they can be associated with a deal or a lead, a person and/or an organization. Call logs do differ from other activities, as they only receive the information needed to describe the phone call.

- `pipedrive-cli call-logs add`  -  Adds a new call log.
- `pipedrive-cli call-logs delete`  -  Deletes a call log. If there is an audio recording attached to it, it will also be deleted.
- `pipedrive-cli call-logs get`  -  Returns details of a specific call log.
- `pipedrive-cli call-logs get-user`  -  Returns all call logs assigned to a particular user.

**channels**  -  Channels API allows you to integrate your existing messaging channels into Pipedrive through [Messaging app extension](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/messaging-app-extension). It enables you to manage and interact with the channel’s conversations, participants and messages inside Pipedrive Messaging inbox: get the historical conversation, receive and send new messages. These endpoints are accessible only through **Messengers integration** OAuth scope together with Messaging manifest in building the [Messaging app extension](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/messaging-app-extension).

- `pipedrive-cli channels add`  -  Adds a new messaging channel, only admins are able to register new channels.
- `pipedrive-cli channels delete`  -  Deletes an existing messenger’s channel and all related entities (conversations and messages).
- `pipedrive-cli channels receive-message`  -  Adds a message to a conversation.

**currencies**  -  Supported currencies which can be used to represent the monetary value of a deal, or a value of any monetary type custom field. The `Currency.code` field must be used to point to a currency. `Currency.code` is the ISO-4217 format currency code for non-custom currencies. You can differentiate custom and non-custom currencies using the `is_custom_flag` property. For custom currencies, it is intended that the formatted sums are displayed in the UI using the following format: [sum][non-breaking space character][currency.symbol], for example: 500 users. Custom currencies cannot be added or removed via the API yet  -  rather the admin users of the account must configure them from the Pipedrive app.

- `pipedrive-cli currencies`  -  Returns all supported currencies in given account which should be used when saving monetary values with other objects.

**deal-fields**  -  Deal fields represent the near-complete schema for a deal in the context of the company of the authorized user. Each company can have a different schema for their deals, with various custom fields. In the context of using deal fields as a schema for defining the data fields of a deal, it must be kept in mind that some types of custom fields can have additional data fields which are not separate deal fields per se. Such is the case with monetary, daterange and timerange fields – each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition to the one presented in the context of deal fields. For example, if there is a monetary field with the key `ffk9s9` stored on the account, `ffk9s9` would hold the numeric value of the field, and `ffk9s9_currency` would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value. To find out which data fields are available, fetch one deal and list its keys.

- `pipedrive-cli deal-fields add`  -  Adds a new deal field. For more information, see the tutorial for adding a new custom field .
- `pipedrive-cli deal-fields delete`  -  Marks multiple deal fields as deleted.
- `pipedrive-cli deal-fields delete-dealfields`  -  Marks a field as deleted. For more information, see the tutorial for deleting a custom field .
- `pipedrive-cli deal-fields get`  -  Returns data about all deal fields.
- `pipedrive-cli deal-fields get-dealfields`  -  Returns data about a specific deal field.
- `pipedrive-cli deal-fields update`  -  Updates a deal field. For more information, see the tutorial for updating custom fields' values .

**deals**  -  Deals represent ongoing, lost or won sales to an organization or to a person. Each deal has a monetary value and must be placed in a stage. Deals can be owned by a user, and followed by one or many users. Each deal consists of standard data fields but can also contain a number of custom fields. The custom fields can be recognized by long hashes as keys. These hashes can be mapped against `DealField.key`. The corresponding label for each such custom field can be obtained from `DealField.name`.

- `pipedrive-cli deals get-timeline`  -  Returns not archived open and won deals
- `pipedrive-cli deals update`  -  Updates the properties of a deal. (Restored core v1 update endpoint.)

**files**  -  Files are documents of any kind (images, spreadsheets, text files, etc.) that are uploaded to Pipedrive, and usually associated with a particular deal, person, organization, product, note or activity. Remote files can only be associated with a particular deal, person or organization. Note that the API currently does not support downloading files although it lets you retrieve a file’s meta-info along with a URL which can be used to download the file by using a standard HTTP GET request.

- `pipedrive-cli files add`  -  Lets you upload a file and associate it with a deal, person, organization, activity, product or lead.

**lead-fields**  -  Lead fields represent the near-complete schema for a lead in the context of the company of the authorized user. Each company can have a different schema for their leads, with various custom fields. In the context of using lead fields as a schema for defining the data fields of a lead, it must be kept in mind that some types of custom fields can have additional data fields which are not separate lead fields per se. Such is the case with monetary, daterange and timerange fields – each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition to the one presented in the context of lead fields. For example, if there is a monetary field with the key `ffk9s9` stored on the account, `ffk9s9` would hold the numeric value of the field, and `ffk9s9_currency` would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value. To find out which data fields are available, fetch one lead and list its keys.

- `pipedrive-cli lead-fields`  -  Returns data about all lead fields.

**lead-labels**  -  Lead labels allow you to visually categorize your leads. There are three default lead labels: hot, cold, and warm, but you can add as many new custom labels as you want.

Currently, these are the possible lead sources: `Manually created`, `Deal`, `Web forms`, `Prospector`, `Leadbooster`, `Live chat`, `Import`, `Website visitors`, `Workflow automation`, and `API`. Lead sources are pre-defined and cannot be edited. Please note that leads sourced from the Chatbot feature are assigned the value `Leadbooster`. Please also note that this list is not final and new sources may be added as needed.

- `pipedrive-cli lead-sources`  -  Returns all lead sources. Please note that the list of lead sources is fixed, it cannot be modified.

**leads**  -  Leads are potential deals stored in Leads Inbox before they are archived or converted to a deal. Each lead needs to be named (using the `title` field) and be linked to a person or an organization. In addition to that, a lead can contain most of the fields a deal can (such as `value` or `expected_close_date`).

- `pipedrive-cli leads add`  -  Creates a lead. A lead always has to be linked to a person or an organization or both.

**legacy-teams**  -  Legacy teams allow you to form groups of users withing the organization for more efficient management. Previously Legacy Teams were called Teams and occupied the `v1/teams*` path. They're being deprecated because we are preparing for an upgraded version of the Teams API, which requires migrating the current functionality to a new path URL `v1/legacyTeams*`. The functionality and [OAuth scopes](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations) of all the Teams API endpoints will remain the same.

- `pipedrive-cli legacy-teams add-team`  -  Adds a new team to the company and returns the created object.
- `pipedrive-cli legacy-teams get-team`  -  Returns data about a specific team.

- `pipedrive-cli mailbox update-mail-thread-details`  -  Updates the properties of a mail thread.

**meetings**  -  Meetings API allows integrating video calling apps into Pipedrive through [Video Calling App extension](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/video-calling-app-extension). It enables you to manage and interact with your video calls and meetings inside Pipedrive. These endpoints are accessible only through apps with video calls integration [OAuth scope](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations).

- `pipedrive-cli meetings delete-user-provider-link`  -  A video calling provider must call this endpoint to remove the link between a user and the installed video calling app.

**oauth**  -  Using OAuth 2.0 is necessary for developing apps that are available in the Pipedrive Marketplace. Authorization via OAuth 2.0 is a well-known and stable way to get fine-grained access to an API. To retrieve OAuth2 tokens you should send requests to the `https://oauth.pipedrive.com` domain. After registering the app, you must add the necessary server-side logic to your app to establish the OAuth flow. Please read more about authorization step on the [Pipedrive Developers page](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-oauth-authorization).

- `pipedrive-cli oauth authorize`  -  Authorize a user by redirecting them to the Pipedrive OAuth authorization page and request their permissions to act on
- `pipedrive-cli oauth get-tokens`  -  After the customer has confirmed the app installation
- `pipedrive-cli oauth refresh-tokens`  -  The `access_token` has a lifetime.

**organization-fields**  -  Organization fields represent the near-complete schema for an organization in the context of the company of the authorized user. Each company can have a different schema for their organizations, with various custom fields. In the context of using organization fields as a schema for defining the data fields of an organization, it must be kept in mind that some types of custom fields can have additional data fields which are not separate organization fields per se. Such is the case with monetary, daterange and timerange fields – each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition to the one presented in the context of organization fields. For example, if there is a monetary field with the key `ffk9s9` stored on the account, `ffk9s9` would hold the numeric value of the field, and `ffk9s9_currency` would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value. To find out which data fields are available, fetch one organization and list its keys.

**permission-sets**  -  Permission sets define what users in the account can do: which actions they are allowed to perform and which features they can access. Permission sets are app-specific, where apps are large parts of functionality, e.g., sales app, which allows accessing sales data, global permissions, which oversee cross-product features (for example contacts, insights, products) or account settings, which provides access to billing, user management, company settings and security center. Some permission sets with types such as admin and regular are pre-created for the account, while other custom ones can be created by users (depending on the tier the account is on).

- `pipedrive-cli permission-sets get`  -  Returns data about all permission sets.
- `pipedrive-cli permission-sets get-permissionsets`  -  Returns data about a specific permission set.

**person-fields**  -  Person fields represent the near-complete schema for a person in the context of the company of the authorized user. Each company can have a different schema for their persons, with various custom fields. In the context of using person fields as a schema for defining the data fields of a person, it must be kept in mind that some types of custom fields can have additional data fields which are not separate person fields per se. Such is the case with monetary, daterange and timerange fields – each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition to the one presented in the context of person fields. For example, if there is a monetary field with the key `ffk9s9` stored on the account, `ffk9s9` would hold the numeric value of the field, and `ffk9s9_currency` would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value.

**product-fields**  -  Product fields represent the near-complete schema for a product in the context of the company of the authorized user. Each company can have a different schema for their products, with various custom fields. In the context of using product fields as a schema for defining the data fields of a product, it must be kept in mind that some types of custom fields can have additional data fields which are not separate product fields per se. Such is the case with monetary, daterange and timerange fields – each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition to the one presented in the context of product fields. For example, if there is a monetary field with the key `ffk9s9` stored on the account, `ffk9s9` would hold the numeric value of the field, and `ffk9s9_currency` would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value. To find out which data fields are available, fetch one product and list its keys.

**products**  -  Products are the goods or services you are dealing with. Each product can have N different price points - firstly, each product can have a price in N different currencies, and secondly, each product can have N variations of itself, each having N prices in different currencies. Note that only one price per variation per currency is supported. Products can be instantiated to deals. In the context of instatiation, a custom price, quantity, duration and discount can be applied.

- `pipedrive-cli project-templates get-projecttemplates`  -  Returns the details of a specific project template.

**projects**  -  Projects represent ongoing, completed or canceled projects attached to an organization, person or to deals. Each project has an owner and must be placed in a phase. Each project consists of standard data fields but can also contain a number of custom fields. The custom fields can be recognized by long hashes as keys.

- `pipedrive-cli projects add`  -  Adds a new project.

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
pipedrive-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Morning triage

```bash
pipedrive-cli stale --quiet-days 14 --limit 10
```

The ten open deals most at risk because nobody has touched them recently.

### Agent-narrow a verbose forecast

```bash
pipedrive-cli forecast --period this-quarter --agent --select pipelines.pipeline_name,pipelines.weighted_value,expected_to_close
```

Pairs --agent with --select dotted paths so an agent gets only the weighted-value fields instead of the full nested forecast payload.

### Find the bottleneck stage

```bash
pipedrive-cli aging --agent
```

Surfaces deals dwelling past their stage's median time-in-stage, so you can see where the pipeline is clogging.

### Incremental change feed for a script

```bash
pipedrive-cli changes --since 24h --json | jq '.entities[] | select(.entity=="deals")'
```

Only the records that moved in the last day, ready to pipe into downstream automation.

### Dedupe contacts before an import

```bash
pipedrive-cli dupes --entity persons --json
```

Clusters of likely-duplicate people by normalized name/email/phone, machine-readable for a cleanup script.

## Auth Setup

Pipedrive uses a personal API token sent in the `x-api-token` header. Copy yours from Personal preferences -> API (https://app.pipedrive.com/settings/personal/api) and set it as `PIPEDRIVE_API_KEY`. Read commands and `sync` need a valid token; offline store queries (analytics, search, and the cached intelligence commands after a sync) work without re-hitting the API.

Run `pipedrive-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  pipedrive-cli activities get <id> --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
pipedrive-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
pipedrive-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
pipedrive-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/pipedrive-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `PIPEDRIVE_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `PIPEDRIVE_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
pipedrive-cli profile save briefing --json
pipedrive-cli --profile briefing activities get <id>
pipedrive-cli profile list --json
pipedrive-cli profile show briefing
pipedrive-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Async Jobs

For endpoints that submit long-running work, the generator detects the submit-then-poll pattern (a `job_id`/`task_id`/`operation_id` field in the response plus a sibling status endpoint) and wires up three extra flags on the submitting command:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--wait` | Block until the job reaches a terminal status instead of returning the job ID immediately |
| `--wait-timeout` | Maximum wait duration (default 10m, 0 means no timeout) |
| `--wait-interval` | Initial poll interval (default 2s; grows with exponential backoff up to 30s) |

Use async submission without `--wait` when you want to fire-and-forget; use `--wait` when you want one command to return the finished artifact.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `pipedrive-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add pipedrive-mcp -- pipedrive-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which pipedrive-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   pipedrive-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `pipedrive-cli <command> --help`.
