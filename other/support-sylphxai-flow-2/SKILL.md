# Support Guideline

## Tech Stack

* **Email**: Resend
* **Framework**: Next.js

## Non-Negotiables

* Unsubscribe must work reliably
* Support contact must be discoverable
* Newsletter/marketing must respect consent preferences

## Context

Support is where user trust is won or lost. When something goes wrong, how easy is it to get help? When help arrives, does it actually solve the problem? Great support turns frustrated users into loyal advocates.

Consider the entire help-seeking journey: finding help, explaining the problem, getting resolution. Where is there friction? Where do users give up? What would make users feel genuinely cared for?

## Driving Questions

* When users need help, can they find it easily?
* What problems do users have that they can't solve themselves?
* How long does it take to resolve a typical support request?
* What would reduce support volume without reducing user satisfaction?
* Where do users get stuck and give up on getting help?
* What would make the support experience genuinely delightful?
