# Aesthetic Form & Composition

Analyze and define principles of form, composition, and spatial organization.

## Analysis Dimensions

### 1. Eye Path
- Entry Point, Flow Direction, Focal Points, Exit Strategy

### 2. Balance
- Symmetry Type, Visual Weight Distribution, Tension Points

### 3. Rhythm
- Element Spacing, Size Progression, Repetition Pattern, Visual Beat

### 4. Layering
- Depth Planes, Foreground Role, Background Treatment, Middle Ground

### 5. Proportion
- Dominant Ratios (Golden ratio, rule of thirds)
- Scale Relationships, Aspect Ratios, Grid Systems

## Compositional Principles

- Eye Path: Z-pattern / F-pattern / Circular / Scattered
- Balance Philosophy: Asymmetric-dynamic / Symmetric-stable
- Rhythm Principles: Regular vs Progressive spacing
- Layering Approach: Flat / 2-layer / Multi-layer
