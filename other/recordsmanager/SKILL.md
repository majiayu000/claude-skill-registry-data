# Records Manager Skill

> Expert record keeping with paperless-ngx integration, country-specific taxonomies, and safe deletion practices

## Overview

The Records Manager Skill is a subject matter expert in record keeping and document management. It integrates with paperless-ngx to provide intelligent document organization, trust-specific expertise, automated workflow management, and safe deletion practices.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Intelligent document upload with automatic tagging
- **NEW: Trust document management** with ATO-compliant retention rules
- **NEW: Automated workflow creation** based on document patterns
- **NEW: Dynamic entity creation** for households, businesses, and trusts
- Country-specific record keeping taxonomies (AU, US, UK)
- Retention requirement checking
- Safe deletion with mandatory confirmation
- Search optimization for document discovery

**Key Safety Feature:**
Document deletion ALWAYS requires explicit approval through the DeleteConfirmation workflow. This prevents catastrophic data loss.

→ Returns: "Document uploaded as #1234 with tags: medical, receipt, tax-deductible"
```

**Example 2: Check retention before deletion**
```
User: "Can I delete my 2019 tax returns?"
→ Invokes Retention workflow

## Workflows

### Upload Workflow

**Triggers:**
- "Upload this document"
- "Store this file"
- "Add to records"
- "Save this [document type]"

**Process:**
1. Ask for file path or document
2. Determine domain (household/corporate/projects) from context or user
3. Use TaxonomyExpert to suggest tags and document type
4. Get or create tags in paperless-ngx
5. Upload document with metadata
6. Confirm upload and show document ID

**CLI Command:**
```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/RecordsManager/Tools/RecordManager.ts upload <file> --domain <domain>
```

---

### Search Workflow

**Triggers:**
- "Find [document type]"
- "Search for [query]"
- "Show me [tag] documents"
- "Where are my [type] records?"

**Process:**
1. Parse search criteria from user request
2. Build search query with tags, types, dates
3. Execute search via PaperlessClient
4. Present results with document details
5. Offer to show more details or refine search

**CLI Command:**
```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/RecordsManager/Tools/RecordManager.ts search --query <text> --tags <tags> --type <type>
```

---

### Organize Workflow

**Triggers:**
- "Organize my records"
- "Clean up documents"
- "Improve document structure"
- "Suggest better tags"

**Process:**
1. Get untagged or poorly tagged documents
2. Use TaxonomyExpert to analyze and suggest improvements
3. Show suggested tags and types
4. Ask user approval before applying
5. Update document metadata in paperless-ngx
6. Report changes made

**CLI Command:**
```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/RecordsManager/Tools/RecordManager.ts organize --domain <domain> --apply
```

---

### Tag Workflow

**Triggers:**
- "Tag these documents"
- "Add [tag] to documents"
- "Change tags on [document]"

**Process:**
1. Get document IDs and tag names from user
2. Verify documents exist
3. Get or create tags in paperless-ngx
4. Apply tags to documents
5. Confirm changes

**CLI Command:**
```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/RecordsManager/Tools/RecordManager.ts tag <docIds> <tagNames>
```

---

### Delete Confirmation Workflow (CRITICAL)

**Triggers:**
- "Delete these documents"
- "Remove old records"
- "Purge [tag] documents"
- **ANY deletion intent**

**Process:**
1. Show documents that will be deleted (ID, title, date, tags)
2. Check retention requirements for each document
3. Warn if documents within retention period
4. Explain consequences (permanent, no undo)
5. Require EXACT confirmation phrase
6. Only after approval: Execute deletion
7. Log decision to audit trail

**MANDATORY APPROVAL PHRASE:**
```
I understand this cannot be undone and I want to proceed with deleting N documents
```

**Do NOT accept:**
- "yes"
- "do it"
- "proceed"
- "delete them"
- Any casual confirmation

**CLI Command:**
```bash
# This command REFUSES to delete and points to the workflow
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/RecordsManager/Tools/RecordManager.ts delete <query>
```

**Why This Matters:**
Deleting records is catastrophic. Tax documents, legal papers, insurance policies - once deleted, they're gone forever. The confirmation workflow ensures:
- Principal sees exactly what will be deleted
- Retention warnings are surfaced
- Decision is intentional and understood
- Audit trail exists for compliance

---

### Retention Workflow

**Triggers:**
- "What can I shred?"
- "How long should I keep [type]?"
- "Retention requirements"
- "Can I delete old [documents]?"

**Process:**
1. Get document type or domain from user
2. Look up retention requirements for country and type
3. Show retention period and legal reason
4. Calculate keep-until date for documents
5. Advise what can be safely archived or deleted

**CLI Command:**
```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/RecordsManager/Tools/RecordManager.ts retention --domain <domain>
```

---

### Info Workflow

**Triggers:**
- "Show me document [ID]"
- "What do you know about [document]?"
- "Details for [document]"

**Process:**
1. Get document ID from user
2. Fetch document details from paperless-ngx
3. Show metadata: title, date, tags, type
4. Check retention requirements
5. Advise if document can be archived or deleted

**CLI Command:**
```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/skills/RecordsManager/Tools/RecordManager.ts info <docId>
```

---

### Add Entity Workflow

**Triggers:**
- "Add a new entity"
- "Create a trust"
- "Set up a new business"
- "Add entity: [type]"

**Process:**
1. Ask entity type (household/corporate/unit-trust/discretionary-trust/family-trust/project)
2. Gather type-specific information (ABN, TFN, trustee, FTE date, etc.)
3. Create entity structure in paperless-ngx:
   - Entity tag for document identification
   - Required tags for entity-specific classification
   - Storage path for hierarchical organization
   - Custom fields for trust metadata
4. Register entity in local registry
5. Confirm entity creation with details

**Example:**
```
User: "Add a family trust for Smith family"
AI: "Creating Smith Family Trust entity..."
    "I'll need some information:"
    "  - Trustee name?"
    "  - ABN?"
    "  - Family Trust Election date?"
    "  - TFN (optional)?"
    [Creates entity tag, storage path, custom fields]
    "✅ Entity created: smith-family-trust-2024"
    "   Documents can now be tagged with 'entity:smith-family-trust'"
```

---

### Workflow Creator Workflow

**Triggers:**
- "Create a workflow for [documents]"
- "Automate tagging of [pattern]"
- "Recommend workflow for [entity]"

**Process:**

2. Analyze document patterns (filename, content, tags)
3. Recommend workflow configuration:
   - Matching pattern
   - Tags to apply
   - Document type to assign
   - Storage path to use
   - Correspondent to assign
4. Show confidence and reasoning
5. Ask for approval
6. Create workflow in paperless-ngx
7. Test workflow on sample documents
8. Report effectiveness

**Example:**
```
User: "Recommend a workflow for Smith Family Trust documents"
AI: "Analyzing 47 documents tagged 'smith-family-trust'..."
    "Recommendation (high confidence):"
    "  Match: 'Smith.*Trust|Family.*Trust.*Smith'"
    "  Assign tag: entity:smith-family-trust"
    "  Assign storage path: /Trusts/Family/Smith Family Trust"
    "  Assign document type: Auto-detect from content"
    "  Reasoning: 45/47 documents match this pattern"
    "Approve? (yes/no)"
```

---

### Workflow Review Workflow

**Triggers:**
- "Review workflow performance"
- "Check workflow effectiveness"
- "Analyze workflow [name]"

### Trust Validation Workflow

**Triggers:**
- "Validate trust documents"
- "Check trust completeness"
- "What documents am I missing for [trust]?"

**Process:**
1. Get trust type and trust name
2. Retrieve required document checklist for trust type
3. Search paperless-ngx for existing documents
4. Compare against checklist
5. Report:
   - Complete documents
   - Missing documents
   - Warnings (FTE retention, expired documents)
   - Retention compliance issues

**Example:**
```
User: "Validate Smith Family Trust documents"
AI: "Checking Smith Family Trust completeness..."
    "Required documents (10):"
    "  ✅ Trust Deed"
    "  ✅ Family Trust Election (FTE) - Retain until 2025-02-01"
    "  ✅ Trustee Appointment"
    "  ⚠️  Beneficiary Declaration - MISSING"
    "  ✅ ABN Registration"
    "  ❌ TFN Registration - NOT FOUND"
    "  ✅ Annual Financial Statements (2023)"
    "  ⚠️  Trustee Resolution (2024) - NOT YET CREATED"
    "  ⚠️  Distribution Minutes (2024) - NOT YET CREATED"
    "  ✅ Tax Return (2023)"
    ""
    "Action items:"
    "  1. Upload Beneficiary Declaration"
    "  2. Upload TFN Registration"
    "  3. Create pre-EOFY trustee resolution (before June 30)"
    "  4. Document beneficiary distributions for 2024"
```

### FTE Check Workflow

**Triggers:**
- "Check FTE retention"
- "When can I delete FTE document?"
- "Family Trust Election compliance"

**Process:**

2. Calculate retention period (5 years from FTE date, not EOFY)
3. Check if retention period has passed
4. Warn if document is still within retention period
5. Advise on retention requirements

**Example:**
```
User: "When can I delete my Family Trust Election document?"
AI: "Family Trust Election Date: 2020-02-01"
    "Retention Period: 5 years from FTE date"
    "Retain Until: 2025-02-01"
    ""
    "⚠️  DO NOT DELETE before 2025-02-01"
    "ATO Requirement: Section 272-80 ITAA 1936"
    "Reason: FTE must be retained for 5 years from lodgment date"
    ""
    "Current Date: 2025-01-17"
    "Days Remaining: 15 days"
    ""
    "After 2025-02-01, you may safely delete this document"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem:** "Country not supported, falling back to Australia"

**Solution:** Taxonomies available for Australia, United States, United Kingdom. For other countries, contribute your country's guidelines!

**Problem:** "Cannot reach paperless-ngx API"

**Solution:** Verify MADEINOZ_RECORDMANAGER_PAPERLESS_URL includes protocol (https://) and instance is running

**Problem:** "API authentication failed"

**Solution:** Regenerate API token in paperless-ngx with correct permissions

**Problem:** "No tags suggested"

**Solution:** Document type or filename may not match known patterns. Manually tag first few to build patterns.
