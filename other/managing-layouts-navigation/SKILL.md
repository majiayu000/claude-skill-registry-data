# Global Layout and Navigation

## When to use this skill
- Editing `layout.tsx`.
- Building responsive navigation.

## Components
- **Navbar**: Sticky top, glassmorphism, dynamic links (Auth state dependent).
- **Mobile Menu**: Hamburger icon, full-screen overlay or slide-out tray.
- **Footer**: Multi-column (destinations, support, social links).

## Instructions
- **Active State**: Highlight current route in the navbar.
- **Responsive**: Ensure the navbar transitions smoothly from desktop links to mobile burger menu.
