## Design Principles for Infographics

**Hierarchy**
- Most important info = largest/highest contrast
- Guide eye with size, color, position
- Use the F-pattern or Z-pattern

**Simplicity**
- One idea per section
- Remove all non-essential elements
- Use white space generously
- Limit to 3-4 colors

**Accuracy**
- Don't distort data for visual effect
- Proportions must be accurate
- Include sources and date
- Define terms if needed

**Clarity**
- Label everything
- Use familiar chart types
- Avoid 3D effects on charts
- High contrast text

**Flow**
- Clear reading path (numbers, arrows)
- Logical progression
- Connected narrative
- Satisfying conclusion

**Brand Consistency**
- Use brand colors and fonts
- Include logo (subtle)
- Match brand personality
- Maintain style across series

## Color Usage in Infographics

**Data Visualization Colors**
- Use distinct hues for categories
- Use gradient for scale/intensity
- Avoid red/green only (colorblind accessible)
- Limit to 5-7 colors max

**Semantic Colors**
- Green: Positive, growth, success
- Red: Negative, decline, warning
- Blue: Neutral, trust, information
- Orange: Attention, caution
- Gray: Context, background

**Contrast**
- Dark text on light background (or vice versa)
- Minimum 4.5:1 for body text
- 3:1 for large text and graphics

## Typography in Infographics

**Hierarchy**
- Headline: Bold, large (48-72pt)
- Section headers: Bold, medium (24-36pt)
- Body text: Regular, readable (14-18pt)
- Captions: Small (10-12pt)

**Fonts**
- Maximum 2 font families
- Sans-serif for data and labels
- Serif optional for headlines
- Avoid script/decorative fonts

**Readability**
- Short lines (40-60 characters)
- Generous line spacing (1.5)
- Left-aligned (not centered)
- No all-caps for paragraphs

## Best Practices

- **Start with data**: Good design can't fix bad data
- **Tell a story**: Have a beginning, middle, end
- **Know your audience**: Complexity level should match
- **One key message**: What's the main takeaway?
- **Use real numbers**: Avoid vague "many" or "most"
- **Cite sources**: Build credibility
- **Test with users**: Does it make sense at a glance?
- **Mobile-friendly**: Most will view on phones
- **High contrast**: Works in bad lighting/small screens
- **Accessible**: Color isn't only indicator
- **Shareable size**: Optimize for social platforms
- **Include attribution**: Logo, website, date
