# Ghostwriter Skill

## Purpose

This skill transforms source material - transcripts, notes, research, interviews - into authentic, human-written content that reads naturally without obvious AI tells. It extends the anti-ai-writing skill by adding voice adaptation and source material conversion techniques.

**Core Philosophy:** The best ghostwriting is invisible. Readers should feel like they're reading a real person's thoughts, not a filtered or processed version of source material.

**This skill assumes you've read the anti-ai-writing skill.** It builds on those fundamentals with additional techniques for voice adaptation and source material conversion.

## When to Use This Skill

Use the Ghostwriter skill when:
- Converting transcripts or interviews into polished articles or newsletters
- Refining notes into publishable content
- Converting source material into different voices or styles
- Building content that maintains a distinctive, personal voice
- Adapting writing to match a specific author's style

**Use in conjunction with:**
- anti-ai-writing skill for core humanization patterns
- Voice style profiles for adapting to specific voices
- Source material that needs authentic conversion
- brand-identity-wizard profile for brand voice consistency

## The Ghostwriting Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Your Source Material

Read through everything completely:
- What's the core insight or story?
- What's the emotional arc?
- What's the most important takeaway?

**Ask yourself:**
- [ ] What's being said that no one else is saying?
- [ ] What will readers think, feel, or do differently?
- [ ] What's the 30-second version of this?

### Step 2: Apply the SUCKS Framework

Before writing:
- [ ] Who is my ONE reader?
- [ ] Is this unique and useful to them?
- [ ] Can I make it clear, curious, and conversational?
- [ ] How do I keep it simple and structured?
- [ ] What will stick with them?

### Step 3: Choose Your Voice Style

Select how to adapt the material:
- Authentic Conversational - for challenging wisdom
- Analytical Enthusiasm - for explaining trends
- Discovery by Deletion - for maximum impact
- Decision Framework - for helping with tradeoffs
- Default (Professional) - for business/default writing

Or create a custom voice profile using the voice-analyzer skill.

### Step 4: Identify Human Desires

Which 1-2 desires does this content tap into?
- Safety of Tribe (belonging)
- Survival & Success (achievement)
- Life Enjoyment (pleasure)
- Social Acceptance (status)
- Comfort & Clarity (simplicity)
- Freedom From Fear (protection)
- Perceived Status (expertise)

Lean into these deliberately throughout the piece.

### Step 5: Convert Source Material

Draft your content:
1. Extract key quotes and ideas from source material
2. Translate them into your chosen voice
3. Structure with clear beginning, middle, end
4. Use specific examples, numbers, and concrete details
5. Create energy transfer (conversation, not lecture)
6. Apply human desire framing throughout

### Step 6: Apply Sticky Sentences

Identify 2-3 most important statements and strengthen them:
- Add alliteration, symmetry, contrast, or rhythm
- Make them quotable
- Make them memorable

**Techniques:**
- Alliteration: "Specificity is the secret"
- Symmetry: "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- Contrast: "To be everywhere is to be nowhere."
- Rhyme: "Tell a story or lose your glory"

### Step 7: Eliminate AI Tells

Go through systematically and remove (reference anti-ai-writing skill):
- [ ] Correlative constructions ("X aren't just Y, they're Z")
- [ ] Overuse of "just" and "actually"
- [ ] Hedge words (might, could, perhaps, seems)
- [ ] Passive voice
- [ ] Corporate jargon
- [ ] Vague language (replace with specifics)
- [ ] Forbidden patterns
- [ ] Too many transitions
- [ ] Overcomplicated sentences

**Test for each sentence:** Would this sentence appear in a ChatGPT output? If yes, rewrite it.

### Step 8: Read Aloud & Quality Check

Read your entire piece aloud:
- [ ] Does it sound like a real person talking?
- [ ] Could I send this to someone without embarrassment?
- [ ] Does energy transfer (not feel formal)?
- [ ] Is every sentence earning its place?
- [ ] Do important ideas have sticky phrasing?
- [ ] Are there obvious AI tells remaining?
- [ ] Does it match the intended voice style?
- [ ] Does it tap into the intended human desires?

## Elements of Effective Ghostwritten Content

When converting source material, include:

1. **Capture attention immediately** - First sentence must hook
2. **Use specific numbers** - "1.5 million" not "many"
3. **Employ pattern interrupts** - Surprise the reader
4. **Address problems directly** - Name the struggle
5. **Write with confidence** - Eliminate hedge words
6. **Highlight concrete benefits** - "Double output in 30 days" not "boost productivity"
7. **Include social proof when relevant** - Results, credentials, validation
8. **Ask powerful questions** - Make readers think
9. **Incorporate warnings** - Create urgency, show stakes
10. **Remind, don't just inform** - Confirm what readers already sense

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Over-Processing Source Material
**Bad:** Turning a natural conversation into corporate-speak
**Good:** Preserving the authentic voice while polishing

### 2. Adding AI-like Phrases
**Bad:** "It's important to note that..." "Moreover..." "Furthermore..."
**Good:** Direct communication with natural transitions

### 3. Losing the Original Insight
**Bad:** Adding so much polish that the core idea disappears
**Good:** Enhancing clarity while preserving original meaning

### 4. Sounding Generic
**Bad:** Making content that could be about anything
**Good:** Making it specific to one person's perspective

### 5. Hedging Your Conviction
**Bad:** "It might be possible that..." "Some experts say..."
**Good:** "This is true because..." "We know..."

### 6. Missing the Human Desire
**Bad:** Content that doesn't tap into any deep motivation
**Good:** Content that clearly connects to belonging, success, clarity, etc.
