description: Explain global agents orchastration strategy and rules to respect all over any realization.

When user ask a new request, always respect thoses rules :
- Treat each user's request with this iterative process
- When user want to create a new application or when he want explicitely modify or add iterations to ITERATIONS_BACKLOG, use firstly the Product Owner agent to analyse and translate user's request to an iterations backlog and write it if not exists.
- Iteration backlog should be maintained and up to date to the progression pof realisation.
- When you start a new iteration and the iteration is already specified in the ITERATION_BACKLOG do treat the iteration as a new one and do not split the iteration into sub-iterations, treat the iteration on a single treatment and a unique already specified iteration.
- Treat user's request step by step following iterations defined into the iterations backlog
- Each iteration execution plan must follow the iteration workflow and plan defined by the Project Manager.
- Project Manager define iteration worflow and verify the iteration successfully followed the expected iteration workflow.
- Other agents must be use to implement realisation of an iteration
- Once an iteration is finished, summup key changes that the user must test manually to validate the iteration delivery. Highlight on added or modified feature dureing the iteration.
