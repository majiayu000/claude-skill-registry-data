# Habit Tracker

The Habit Tracker skill helps you design, implement, and maintain positive habits using proven behavioral science principles. Rather than relying on willpower alone, this skill applies implementation intentions, habit stacking, and environmental design to make new behaviors stick.

This skill recognizes that habit formation is about systems, not motivation. It guides you through creating "tiny habits" that are easy to start, anchoring new behaviors to existing routines, and building progressive complexity as habits solidify. The focus is on consistency over intensity—showing up matters more than perfection.

The tracker provides gentle accountability through streak tracking and pattern recognition, helping you identify what's working and what needs adjustment. It celebrates small wins and helps you recover quickly from missed days without shame or abandonment.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Habit Design
1. **Behavior Clarification**: Defines the specific, observable action
2. **Trigger Identification**: Links habit to existing routine or context
3. **Tiny Habits Scaling**: Starts with ridiculously small version
4. **Environment Design**: Modifies surroundings to make habit easier
5. **Tracking Setup**: Creates simple, frictionless tracking method
6. **Celebration Planning**: Designs immediate reward/acknowledgment
7. **Obstacle Anticipation**: Identifies likely barriers and solutions

### Workflow 2: Daily Check-In
Quick habit completion tracking:
1. Reviews today's habit list
2. Marks completed habits
3. Records any notes or patterns
4. Celebrates streaks
5. Reschedules missed habits if appropriate

### Workflow 3: Weekly Habit Review
Analyzes patterns and adjusts approach:
1. **Completion Rate**: Calculates consistency percentage
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies what days/circumstances work best
3. **Obstacle Analysis**: Reviews what got in the way
4. **Difficulty Assessment**: Too hard? Too easy? Just right?
5. **Adjustment Planning**: Modifies habit or environment as needed
6. **Streak Celebration**: Acknowledges consistency wins

### Workflow 4: Habit Stacking
Links new habit to existing routine:
1. Identifies reliable existing behavior
2. Defines the new behavior
3. Creates "After I [existing], I will [new]" formula
4. Tests the stack for natural fit
5. Refines timing and sequence

## Habit Formation Framework

### The Habit Loop
1. **Cue/Trigger**: What initiates the behavior?
2. **Routine**: What is the actual behavior?
3. **Reward**: What benefit reinforces it?

### Tiny Habits Method
Make it so small you can't say no:
- Want to meditate? Start with 3 breaths.
- Want to exercise? Start with 1 push-up.
- Want to read more? Start with 1 page.

**The Rule**: If you can't do it in 2 minutes, make it smaller.

### Habit Stacking Formula
```
After I [EXISTING HABIT],
I will [NEW TINY HABIT]
```

Examples:
- "After I pour my morning coffee, I will write 1 sentence in my journal"
- "After I close my laptop for the day, I will do 5 push-ups"
- "After I sit down at my desk, I will take 3 deep breaths"

### Progressive Complexity
Start tiny, then scale:
1. **Week 1-2**: Master the tiny version (1 push-up)
2. **Week 3-4**: Add modest complexity (5 push-ups)
3. **Week 5-6**: Approach target behavior (full workout routine)

ANCHOR HABIT: [Reliable existing behavior]

CELEBRATION: [Immediate acknowledgment]

FORMULA:
"After I [ANCHOR],
I will [NEW HABIT],
Then I will [CELEBRATE]."

EXAMPLE:
"After I pour my coffee,
I will write one sentence,

```

## Best Practices

- **Start absurdly small** - You can always do more; you can't always do less
- **Focus on showing up** - Consistency beats intensity
- **Track immediately** - Don't wait until end of day
- **Never miss twice** - One miss is life; two is a pattern
- **Design your environment** - Make it visible, easy, attractive
- **Anchor to existing routines** - Leverage what already works
- **Celebrate immediately** - Tiny acknowledgment reinforces behavior
- **Review weekly, not daily** - Patterns emerge over time
- **Forgive quickly** - Missed days are data, not failure
- **Scale slowly** - Master tiny before going big
- **Limit concurrent habits** - 1-3 new habits maximum
- **Make it obvious** - Visual cues trigger action
- **Reduce friction** - Eliminate steps between intention and action
- **Stack related habits** - Build routines, not isolated behaviors
- **Use identity language** - "I'm a person who..." vs. "I'm trying to..."

## Behavioral Science Principles

### The 2-Minute Rule
If it takes less than 2 minutes, it's sustainable. Scale your habit to fit:
- "Read for 30 minutes" → "Read 1 page"
- "Do yoga" → "Roll out my yoga mat"
- "Study Spanish" → "Do 1 Duolingo lesson"

### Implementation Intentions
"I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]"
- Doubles likelihood of follow-through
- Removes decision-making friction
- Creates automatic triggers

### Temptation Bundling
Pair habit you need with habit you want:
- "I can watch Netflix ONLY while on the treadmill"
- "I can have coffee AFTER I meditate"
- "I can check social media AFTER writing session"

### Environment Design
Make good habits:
- **Obvious**: Visual cues (gym bag by door)
- **Easy**: Remove friction (sleep in workout clothes)
- **Attractive**: Bundle with pleasure (great playlist)
- **Satisfying**: Track visually (streak calendar)

Make bad habits:
- **Invisible**: Remove cues
- **Hard**: Add friction
- **Unattractive**: Highlight costs
- **Unsatisfying**: Get accountability partner

## Common Habit Pitfalls

### Starting Too Big
❌ "Exercise for an hour daily"
✓ "Do 1 push-up after brushing teeth"

### Too Many at Once
❌ Starting 10 new habits
✓ Master 1, then add another

### Relying on Motivation
❌ "I'll do it when I feel like it"
✓ "After coffee, I will [habit]"

### No Environment Design
❌ Keeping phone in bedroom
✓ Charge phone in kitchen overnight

### All-or-Nothing Thinking
❌ "I missed a day, I failed"
✓ "One miss is fine, back at it tomorrow"

## Integration Points

This skill works well with:
- **Daily Planner**: Schedule habit blocks into daily plan
- **Goal Setter**: Connect habits to larger goal outcomes
- **Time Blocker**: Reserve time for habit practice
- **Journal Prompter**: Reflect on habit patterns and insights
- **Focus Timer**: Use Pomodoro for habit sessions

## Example Habit Design Session

**User**: "build a habit"

**Skill Response**:
"Let's design a habit that actually sticks. The key is starting small and building on what already works.

First question: **What behavior do you want to make automatic?**

Be specific about the action itself, not just the outcome. For example:
- 'Exercise daily' is an outcome
- 'Do 10 push-ups' is a behavior

What's the behavior?"

**User**: "I want to meditate every morning"

**Skill Response**:
"Meditation is excellent for focus and stress management. Now let's make this stick.

**Making it tiny:**
What's the smallest version of meditation you could do? Something so easy you'd feel silly NOT doing it?
- 1 minute?
- 3 deep breaths?
- 30 seconds of silence?

Remember: You can always do more, but we're designing for consistency, not perfection. What's your tiny version?"

**User**: "3 deep breaths"

**Skill Response**:
"Perfect. 3 breaths is small enough that you can't talk yourself out of it.

**Habit stacking:**
Now let's anchor this to something you already do reliably every morning. What's one thing you NEVER skip?
- Making coffee?
- Brushing teeth?
- Checking your phone?
- Getting out of bed?

What's your reliable anchor?"
