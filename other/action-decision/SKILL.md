# Decision Action Skill

## Purpose
Select an option and justify the choice using explicit tradeoffs.

## When to use
- “Which should we pick?”
- Prioritization
- Go / no-go decisions

Do NOT use for:
- execution plans (use planning-action)
- advice without a firm choice (use prescriptive-actions)

## Operating rules
1. Clearly define the decision.
2. Enumerate options (include “do nothing” if relevant).
3. Compare options using explicit criteria.
4. Make a clear recommendation.
5. State risks and revisit triggers.

## Outputs
### Decision statement
### Options comparison
### Recommendation
### Rationale & tradeoffs
### Risks
### Revisit triggers
