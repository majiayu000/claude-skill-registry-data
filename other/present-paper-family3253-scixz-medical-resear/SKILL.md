# Present-Paper Skill

## Purpose

Prepare a polished academic presentation from a research paper. The skill walks through a 5-phase
pipeline: paper analysis, supporting research, script writing, slide note injection, and Q&A
preparation.

Use it when:

- preparing a journal club or seminar presentation
- presenting a paper for a graduate course
- preparing grand rounds or conference talks based on a published paper
- building speaker notes for an existing slide deck

---

## Communication Rules

- Communicate with the user in their preferred language.
- Use English for medical, statistical, and methodological terminology.
- Add pronunciation guides for drug names and technical abbreviations in the user's language.
- Be direct about paper limitations, but frame them constructively.

---

## Phase 0: Init & Outline

### Step 0a — Load design references (read before drafting outline)

Three of these are read **now**, in full — they change what you produce. The rest are read **when the
answer to Q0 tells you which one you need**, because a talk has one venue and one style, and reading
the others costs roughly seven thousand tokens to learn nothing you will use.

**Read now (always):**

**A. `references/ai_slide_tells.md`** — the marks a generated deck leaves. Read all of it, first.
The complaint about AI decks is **not** that they are ugly — templates solved ugly. It is that they
*stop communicating*, because they were built to make the maker comfortable rather than to serve the
audience. This file is why the deck does not need catching later; `scripts/check_slide_tells.py`
catches it after (Step 3.6). It **overrules older guidance where they conflict** — in particular the
eyebrow-on-every-slide and brand-footer rules this project used to mandate, which are the single
most-cited visual tell.

**B. `references/presentation_archetypes.md`** — the **skeleton**, chosen by where the speaker is
standing: conference oral, journal-club critique, case-anchored grand rounds, didactic lecture,
defence, keynote (Duarte's sparkline, the Jobs STAR moment, Takahashi/Lessig), lay talk, decision
brief (Minto's pyramid, action titles, Kawasaki's 10/20/30). A deck has **two independent choices**
and conflating them is why talks fail: the *archetype* is what the talk has to **do**; the *visual
style* is what it **looks like**. A conference oral in a keynote's skeleton dies (no data on the
slides); a keynote in a conference oral's skeleton dies harder. **The skin is a preference; the
skeleton is not.** Its mechanical half is `scripts/check_deck_budget.py`.

**C. `references/presentation_design_guidelines.md`** — the enforceable rules (assertion headlines,
24-pt floor, negative space, ≤3 colours, colourblind-safe palettes, redraw-don't-screenshot,
animation discipline) plus the G1–G10 self-check the Phase 3.5 critic scores against.

**Read on demand — after Q0/Q2 tell you which one:**

| File | Read it when | Cost if read blindly |
|---|---|---|
| `references/medical_presentation_templates.md` | the venue is one of the five medical ones — then read **that section only** | ~3,700 tokens, of which you use a fifth |
| `references/slide_visual_styles/CATALOG.md` → one style file | Q2 has chosen a style | ~2,300 tokens per style |
| `references/slide_design_principles.md` | you are stuck on *why* a slide is not landing — Reynolds / Duarte / Knaflic / Tufte, the theory under the rules in **C** | ~2,600 tokens of theory you mostly already applied |

These mirror the entry-point pattern used in
`make-figures/references/design_principles.md` (Step 1 "Specify"). Both skills share
the same Reynolds / Knaflic / Tufte foundations — slide-level (this skill) and
figure-level (make-figures) are companions, not duplicates.

### Required Inputs

Before starting, collect these from the user:

| Input | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Paper** | PDF path, DOI, or PMID |
| **Presentation time** | Determines depth and slide count |
| **Target audience** | Specialty mix, knowledge level — controls terminology depth |
| **Context** | Course name, conference, journal club format, prior session topics |
| **Template / visual style** | Institutional template (.pptx/.potx) to fill, or a visual style to generate in. Default: ask (Step 0b) |
| **Extension section** | Optional topic to include (e.g., AI directions, clinical implications). Default: none |

### Step 0b — Template & visual style selection

After collecting the inputs above and **before** drafting the outline, settle how the
deck will look. Ask the user two questions (use `AskUserQuestion`; skip a question if the
user already answered it in their request):

**Q0 — "Where are you standing, and for how long?"** (venue + minutes)

This decides the **archetype** — the skeleton — before any question about looks. Map the answer with
the selector table in `references/presentation_archetypes.md`, and carry `archetype` + `minutes`
forward: Step 3.6 checks the built deck against them. A 40-word slide is an ordinary academic slide
and a catastrophic keynote slide; there is no universal answer to "how much text is too much", only
an answer for *this room*.

If the user gives only a topic and no venue, **ask**. Do not guess: a deck built for no particular
room comes out generic in exactly the way every reviewer can see.

**Q1 — "Do you have an institutional or branded template to use?"**
- **Yes** → the user supplies a `.pptx`/`.potx`. Switch to **Mode C** (Phase 3, "Fill an
  institutional template"): run `scripts/inspect_pptx_template.py <file>` to list its
  layouts/placeholders/theme, then fill by placeholder index, preserving the master and
  logo. See `references/slide_visual_styles/institutional_brand.md`. Do **not** also ask
  Q2 — the template's theme *is* the style.
- **No / none** → ask Q2.

**Q2 — "Which visual style should I generate in?"** Offer the `CATALOG.md` menu with a
one-line preview each (make the recommended option first and label it):

| Option | One-line preview |
|--------|------------------|
| **Nature / Lancet** *(recommended for medical academic talks)* | White, navy + coral accent, hairline dividers, Inter/Pretendard — restrained editorial-academic |
| **Clinical Blue** | White/light-blue, navy-teal, calm and trustworthy, colorblind-safe — grand rounds / CME |
| **Editorial Mono** | High-contrast black-on-white, oversized type, one accent — single big-message keynote |
| **Dark Modern** | Deep-slate background, off-white text, electric accent — AI / method / tech talks |
| **Other** | Describe a palette/feel, or name a journal/brand to emulate |

Record the choice; pass the matching style spec to Phase 3. If the user has no
preference and the talk is a medical academic talk, default to **Nature / Lancet**
(`~/.claude/rules/academic-lecture-style.md`). Style choice does not change the outline,
script, or Q&A — only Phase 3 rendering.

### Paper Analysis

Read the paper and produce a structured analysis:

```text

```text
## Slide Outline ([N] slides, [M] minutes)

| # | Title | Time | Key Content |
|---|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Title slide | 0:30 | Paper citation, presenter |

| 3 | Background | 1:30 | The gap this paper fills |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| N | Take-home messages | 0:30 | 3-5 key points |
```

**Gate: User approves outline before proceeding.**

---

## Phase 1: Supporting Research

### Search Strategy

Find references that strengthen the presentation:

1. **Follow-up studies** — Has the main finding been replicated or extended?
2. **Clinical trial data** — Large-scale data that contextualizes the findings
3. **Review articles** — Authoritative summaries that frame the topic
4. **Contradicting evidence** — Important for balanced Q&A preparation

**Efficiency rule:** Limit supporting references to 5-8 total. Only search categories
that the approved outline (Phase 0) actually requires. Skip categories not needed for
the presentation type (e.g., skip clinical trials for a methods-focused paper).

### Selection Criteria

Do NOT summarize every paper found. Extract only:

- Specific data points needed for slides (incidence rates, OR/HR, AUC values)
- Findings that directly support or challenge the main paper
- Context that helps the audience understand significance

### Output

```text
## Verified References

### Main Paper
1. [Citation] — PMID: XXXXX, DOI: XX.XXXX/XXXXX

### Supporting References
2. [Citation] — PMID: XXXXX
   → Used for: [specific data point or context]
3. [Citation] — PMID: XXXXX
   → Used for: [specific data point or context]

### Key Data for Slides
- [Statistic 1]: [value] — Source: [Ref #]
- [Statistic 2]: [value] — Source: [Ref #]
```

**Every reference must have a verified DOI or PMID. Mark unverified references with [UNVERIFIED].**

---

## Phase 2: Script & Content

### Speaker Script

Draft a complete speaker script with these requirements:

1. **Language**: User's preferred language for narration; English for technical terms
2. **Audience adaptation**: Adjust explanation depth based on Phase 0 audience profile
   - For mixed audiences: add one-line plain-language explanations for specialty-specific terms
   - Example: "FLAIR sequence — an MRI technique that suppresses fluid signal to highlight edema"
3. **Pronunciation guide**: Include native-language pronunciation for drug names, abbreviations
   - Example: "lecanemab (leh-KAN-eh-mab)" or local equivalent
4. **Timing markers**: Note approximate time per slide
5. **Transition phrases**: Connect each slide to the narrative arc

### Structure

```text
## Speaker Script

### Slide 1: Title (0:30)
"[Opening — introduce yourself and the paper]"

### Slide 2: Context (1:00)
"[Connect to prior knowledge or clinical relevance]"

...

### Slide N: Take-home Messages (0:30)
"[Summarize 3-5 key points. Thank audience. Invite questions.]"
```

### Extension Section (Optional)

Only include if user requested in Phase 0. Examples:

- AI/computational research directions stemming from the paper
- Clinical practice implications
- Policy or guideline implications
- Connections to the user's own research

**Gate: User reviews script before proceeding.**

---

## Phase 3: Slides & Notes

### Three Modes

**Mode A** = generate a new deck in a chosen visual style. **Mode B** = add notes to an
existing deck. **Mode C** = fill the user's institutional/branded template (chosen at
Step 0b). Pick the mode from the Step 0b answer.

**Mode A: Generate new slide deck**

Generate a fully-editable PPTX from structured inline data using `python-pptx`. Two
canonical template libraries:

- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/generate_pptx_templates.py` — generic T_lead /
  T_text / T_table / T_image_right / etc. templates with smoke-tested `main()`. Use
  for journal club, grand rounds, conference talk, and short paper talks.
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/build_pptx_nature_lancet.py` — Nature/Lancet visual
  style (white + navy + coral, Inter/Pretendard, 47-slide academic lecture proven).
  Use for **academic lecture multi-paper survey** (template #5). Functions:
  `new_presentation`, `add_title_slide`, `add_toc_slide`, `add_section_divider`,
  `add_transition_slide`, `add_content_slide`, `add_glossary_slide`,
  `add_closing_slide`, plus `fix_app_xml()` helper. Style spec:
  `references/slide_visual_styles/nature_lancet.md`.

For lecture decks pulling figures from PDFs (rather than from `/make-figures`
output), use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/extract_pdf_figures.py` — pdftoppm + PIL
crop with normalized (0–1) box coordinates. Supports both single-crop CLI and YAML
batch config.

After raw extraction, run `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/trim_caption.py` to
**auto-remove journal headers / figure captions / surrounding whitespace** so
that only the figure body remains — the Adobe-Acrobat-crop equivalent in
automation. The script uses horizontal-projection segmentation plus
text-band detection (height + density + gap + line-pattern signature) and
preserves multi-panel figures intact:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/trim_caption.py" \
  --in-dir  figures/extracted \
  --out-dir figures/cropped
```

Handles four common journal layouts: top running-head bar, bottom multi-line
caption (sparse text), bottom caption *fused* with figure body (no clear gap,
detected via narrow dark/light alternation), and multi-row tables with
footnotes (footnote cut, table rows preserved). No tesseract / OCR
dependency — Pillow + numpy only. Verified on 12-figure academic deck
(80–95% height retention; captions, journal banners, and CellPress-style
headers all removed). When the deck slot expects only the figure body
(default for `build_pptx_nature_lancet.py`), point `FIG_DIR` at the cropped
output dir.

### Word-boundary aware markdown parser (mandatory for HLA-rich decks)

When the build script parses inline `**bold**` / `*italic*` markers in slide
body or speaker notes, the italic rule must use **word-boundary lookahead /
lookbehind** so asterisk-bearing scientific tokens (HLA alleles like
`DRB1*07:01`, `HLA-A*02:01`, SNP IDs, footnote markers) are not eaten as
italic delimiters:

```python
import re
pattern = re.compile(
    r"(\*\*(?:(?!\*\*).)+?\*\*"                           # bold; inner single * allowed
    r"|(?<![A-Za-z0-9])\*[^*\n]+?\*(?![A-Za-z0-9]))"      # italic (word-boundary)
)
```

Two regex tricks together:
1. **Italic with boundary**: `(?<![A-Za-z0-9])` and `(?![A-Za-z0-9])` reject
   `*` adjacent to alphanumerics, so `DRB1*07:01` is left intact.
2. **Bold tolerates inner single `*`**: `(?:(?!\*\*).)+?` allows
   `**DRB1*04:02**` (HLA allele inside bold) to match as a single bold span.

Without these, a naive `\*[^*]+\*` italic pattern silently corrupts every
HLA allele in the deck. Add the regex to `add_styled()` (or equivalent) in
every Nature/Lancet-style build script.

### Pronunciation auto-augment for non-native presenters

For decks where the presenter is uncomfortable with English pronunciation of
acronyms, author names, drug names, or gene symbols, append a per-slide
`[ Pronunciation ]` section to the speaker notes (audience sees nothing —
only Presenter View). Use
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/inject_pronunciation_notes.py`:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/inject_pronunciation_notes.py" \
  input.pptx output.pptx \
  --dict pron_dict.yaml \
  --header "[ 발음 ]"            # or any header you like
```

The script:
- Loads a YAML/JSON `PRON_DICT` (term → [reading, full_name]) supplied by
  the caller. The dict is domain-specific — assemble it for your audience
  (Korean readings, French readings, Spanish readings, etc.).
- Uses **word-boundary regex** `(?<![A-Za-z0-9_]) … (?![A-Za-z0-9_])` so
  short acronyms (e.g. `AE`, `OR`) only match when standalone, never inside
  other words.
- Recognizes allele-style tokens via a separate regex
  (`\b(?:HLA-)?[A-Z]{1,5}[0-9]?\*[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}\b` by default) and
  synthesizes their reading from the base allele entry in the dict.
- Skips slides that already contain the header (idempotent — safe to re-run).

Realistic yield on a 47-slide academic deck: ~38 slides receive a section,
~300 total term entries, 5–10 per annotated slide. Transition and divider
slides have empty notes and are auto-skipped.

### Speaker notes statistics density

When the slide body already shows exact OR / 95% CI / p-value, the notes
should NOT repeat the same numbers — the presenter ends up reading
statistics aloud and the audience cannot keep up. Notes should be a
**narrative** (key anchors + one-line "see the slide body for the exact
numbers" reminder), not a numeric listing.

Quick measurement to spot dense slides during QC:

```python
import re
text = slide.notes_slide.notes_text_frame.text.split(pron_header)[0]
n_char = len(text)
n_stat = len(re.findall(r"\b(?:OR|p|CI)\s*[=<>]?\s*\d|\d+\.\d+|\d+%|×10", text))
needs_compression = n_char > 1000 and n_stat >= 5
```

Rule of thumb: 700–1,000 chars + 0–2 stat tokens is fine (30–60-second
narrative). >1,000 chars + ≥5 stat tokens → compress to narrative tone and
point at the slide body. Exact numbers belong in the slide body and
footnotes (SSOT), not the notes.

### Sharing-ready notes-stripped variant

After the presentation, when the deck is shared with the audience (e.g. a
professor asking for the slides), the speaker notes typically contain
presenter-only material — second-language narrative, pronunciation hints,
self-referential reminders ("Prof. ○○ will likely ask about …"). Stripping
notes is mandatory before circulation. Use
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/strip_notes_for_sharing.py`:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/strip_notes_for_sharing.py" \
  presenter_v9.pptx share/<topic>_<initials>.pptx
```

The script:
- Clears every slide's `notes_text_frame` (idempotent, slide body and
  figures untouched).
- Re-writes `docProps/app.xml` with the correct `Slides=` and `Notes=`
  counts so PowerPoint Mac does not show its repair dialog (see also the
  app.xml canonical fix in `pptx-mac-compatibility.md` §5).
- Verifies that zero notes characters remain.

Recommended 3-file sharing package (filename pattern `<topic>_<initials>`):
- `<topic>_<initials>.pptx` — notes-stripped variant for slide reuse
- `<topic>_<initials>.pdf` — same deck, PDF for environment-agnostic
  preview (LibreOffice `--convert-to pdf` automatically drops the cleared
  notes pages)
- `<topic>_<initials>_references.zip` — optional bundle of the reference
  PDFs; if it exceeds the email attachment limit, send a Google Drive link.

In the cover email, mention the PPTX is included specifically so the
recipient can reuse individual slides if useful.

### Architecture

```
inline structured data (lists/dicts in build_*_slides())
    ↓ template functions (T_lead / T_text / T_table / ...)
editable PPTX with native text frames (selectable, restyleable in PowerPoint)
```

Three rules that keep slides stable:

1. **No markdown parsing.** Every slide is a function call with explicit inline data.
2. **No `cur_top` cumulative position tracking.** Use the fixed coordinate zones below — `cur_top` accumulates rounding errors and breaks layout after ~10 slides.
3. **No Marp.** Marp renders to images; the deck becomes uneditable and reviewers cannot copy text or restyle.

### Slide-type templates

| Template | Use for | Required fields |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `T_lead` | Title slide, section divider | `title`, `subtitle?`, `extra?` |
| `T_text` | Bullet body (most common) | `title`, `body_lines[]`, `subtitle?` |
| `T_table` | Cohort tables, comparisons | `title`, `headers[]`, `rows[][]`, `body_before?` |
| `T_image_right` | Body + figure on right | `title`, `body_lines[]`, `img_path`, `img_pct?` (PNG ≥300dpi or vector PDF — see Figure source formats below) |
| `T_quote_slide` | Verbatim citations, witness quotes | `title`, `quotes[]`, `body_after?`, `img_path?` |
| `T_two_col` | Compare/contrast | `title`, `left_lines[]`, `right_lines[]` |
| `T_two_col_with_box` | Compare + emphasis | as above + `metaphor_col`, `metaphor_lines[]` |
| `T_highlight_slide` | Single key result | `title`, `highlight_lines[]`, `body_before?` |
| `T_metaphor_body` | Body + analogy footer | `title`, `body_lines[]`, `metaphor_lines[]` |
| `T_table_two_col` | Take-aways + numeric table | `title`, `left_lines[]`, `headers[]`, `rows[][]` |

### Figure source formats (when consuming `/make-figures` output)

When the deck pulls figures from `analysis/figures/` produced by `/make-figures`:

- **Preferred for slides**: PNG at ≥300 dpi. python-pptx `add_picture()` handles this directly. Set `img_pct` (template `T_image_right`) so the figure occupies ≥40 % of slide width on a 13.33 × 7.5-in widescreen layout.
- **Vector source available**: prefer PDF only if the slide will be projected at >1080p or printed as a handout — convert PDF → PNG at the target DPI (`pdftoppm -r 300 input.pdf out_prefix`) before insertion, because python-pptx PDF embedding is unreliable across PowerPoint versions.
- **Forbidden**: TIFF (Mac PowerPoint silently drops it — see Mac compatibility checklist below); JPEG for line art (compression artifacts on diagonal lines); raw SVG (PowerPoint Mac handles it inconsistently).
- **Caption / legend**: re-draft for spoken-narration context, not the journal legend verbatim. The journal legend assumes a reader; the slide caption assumes a listener with 5–10 seconds of attention.

### Diagrams and plots are drawn as CODE, then inserted (not out of autoshapes)

**Hard rule. This is the highest-yield rule in the skill**, and it is the one thing practitioners
report actually working when they hand slide-making to an agent:

> "에이전틱하게 PPT 도구를 사용하거나 / 웹페이지 형식으로 구성하는 경우는 거의 100% 실패함. 그나마
> 성공률을 높일 방법은 다이어그램 / 플롯을 모두 잘 알려진 도구(matplotlib 등)를 활용해 '코드'로
> 그리도록 시킨 다음, 그 결과를 그대로 삽입하도록 지시하는 방법인 듯."

| Content | Draw it with | Never |
|---|---|---|
| Any chart | matplotlib / R (`/make-figures`) | Hand-placed shapes pretending to be a chart |
| Flow, mechanism, pipeline, hierarchy | matplotlib, or **Graphviz DOT** when the graph *is* the point | `python-pptx` autoshapes |
| Study flow (STROBE/PRISMA) | `/make-figures` flow builders | Boxes drawn one at a time |

Then insert the rendered PNG (≥300 dpi) with `add_picture()`.

**Why the ban.** Building a diagram out of autoshapes produces both AI tells at once: a row of
identical rounded rectangles (`SHAPE_MONOTONY`) joined by arrows nobody labelled
(`ARROW_NO_SEMANTICS`). Graphviz makes the second one *structurally hard to get wrong* — a DOT edge
must be written `A -> B [label="seeds along"]`, so the language itself demands the arrow declare
what it claims:

```dot
digraph mechanism {
  rankdir=LR; node [shape=box, fontname="Inter"];
  catheter -> tract   [label="seeds along"];
  tract    -> nodule  [label="grows into"];   // an arrow that says what it means
}
```

An arrow is a claim — *causes, becomes, flows into, is compared with, predicts*. Six claims, one
glyph. Drawn unlabelled, every person in the room supplies a different verb, and one wrong arrow can
derail an entire discussion. See `references/ai_slide_tells.md` §4–5.

**The one exception**: a single, deliberate, labelled shape used as an accent (a callout box, a
highlight frame). One shape is a choice; eight identical ones are a generator.

### Helpers (used by templates — usually you do not call directly)

| Helper | Role |
|--------|------|
| `_text` | Single text box with `**bold**` inline markup |
| `_multiline` | Multi-line block with bullet (`- `, `✓ `) and `### subhead` support |
| `_title_block` | Title + teal underline + optional subtitle |
| `_table` | Styled table (teal header row, alternating rows) |
| `_quote` | Blockquote — teal left bar + light-blue background |
| `_highlight` | Yellow rounded box + orange 2pt border |
| `_metaphor` | Same shape as quote, lighter font |
| `_image` | PIL aspect-preserving image insert (handles iPhone EXIF if you transpose first) |
| `_slidenum` | Bottom-right page number |

### Design tokens (defaults — change to fit institution/journal)

```python
NAVY    = #1B2A4A   # title text, section divider background
TEAL    = #0072B2   # subtitle, underline, table header bg, quote bar
ORANGE  = #D55E00   # highlight box border
GRAY    = #333333   # body text
FONT    = 'Apple SD Gothic Neo'   # use a Latin-only font on non-Korean decks
```

### Fixed coordinate zones (16:9 = 13.333" × 7.5")

```
ML / MR = 0.8"     MT = 0.5"     CW = SW − ML − MR = 11.733"

TITLE_Y = 0.5"    TITLE_H = 0.8"
SUB_Y   = 1.3"    SUB_H   = 0.5"
BODY_Y  ≈ 1.9"    BODY_H  ≈ 5.1"
```

### Build script responsibilities

A from-scratch generation script must:

- Convert TIFF images to PNG before `add_picture` (Mac PowerPoint silently drops TIFF).
- Apply EXIF transpose to iPhone photos before insertion.
- After inserting/removing slides, sync `docProps/app.xml` (`<Slides>`, `<Notes>`, `HeadingPairs`, `TitlesOfParts`) to the actual count, or PowerPoint Mac will raise a recovery dialog on open.
- If you copy `<a:srcRect>` from another deck, copy the values verbatim — they are 1/1000-percent (cap 100000), never EMU. A unit conversion bug here crops 99% of the image off-slide.
- Print slide count, notes count, file size, and editability check at the end.

### Forbidden in Mode A

- ❌ Marp CLI for PPTX (always image-rendered, uneditable).
- ❌ Markdown auto-parsing into slides (layout drifts on every regeneration).
- ❌ `cur_top` cumulative top tracking (accumulates rounding error).
- ❌ Direct iPhone photo insert without EXIF transpose (rotated 90° in PowerPoint).
- ❌ Using `python-pptx` from-scratch rebuild to *edit* an existing deck — see Patch over Rebuild below.

### Mac PowerPoint compatibility checklist

PowerPoint Mac is stricter than Windows / Keynote / LibreOffice on OOXML defects.
Verify before delivering any deck destined for a Mac viewer:

| Defect | Detect | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **TIFF images** | `find ppt/media -iname '*.tif*'` | `sips -s format png in.tif --out out.png` + replace `.tif`→`.png` in `_rels/*.rels` |
| **`<a:sp3d>` in rPr** | `grep -l '<a:sp3d>' ppt/slides/*.xml` | Regex-strip the `<a:sp3d>...</a:sp3d>` block (renders as red outline only on Mac) |
| **`app.xml` count mismatch** | `<Slides>` value + `HeadingPairs` count + `TitlesOfParts` size vs actual slide files | Sync all four fields to real count |
| **`srcRect` corruption** | Any value > 100000 (1/1000-percent cap) | Compare with original deck; restore verbatim |

Validation must run on **PDF export AND Mac PowerPoint** — neither alone catches all four. PDF misses `sp3d` outlines and `srcRect` corruption.

### Patch over Rebuild — editing an existing PPTX

When the user supplies an existing deck and asks for surgical edits (textbox width, image
crop, font swap, sp3d removal), prefer **regex/sed patching of the unzipped XML** over
regenerating with `python-pptx`. From-scratch rebuild loses:

- `<a:srcRect>` image crops
- `<a:sp3d>` / `<a:scene3d>` (when intentional)
- Slide master / layout / theme details
- `app.xml` and `core.xml` metadata

```bash
unzip -q original.pptx -d /tmp/work
python3 -c "

`python-pptx` is reserved for (a) brand-new decks built via the templates above, or
(b) appending speaker notes via `slide.notes_slide.notes_text_frame.text`. The skill's
`scripts/inject_speaker_notes.py` is the canonical example of (b). It parses inline
`**bold**` / `*italic*` into run-level styling by default (python-pptx stores `text`
verbatim, so the markers would otherwise show literally in Presenter View — the failure
mode `pptx-speaker-notes.md` warns against); pass `--no-markdown` for legacy plain text.
A reproducible check lives at `tests/test_speaker_notes_markdown.py`.

### Standard structure (10–15 min paper talk)

1. Title slide (`T_lead`) — paper citation + presenter
2. Background (`T_text` × 1–2)
3. Study design / Methods (`T_text` or `T_two_col`)
4. Key results with figures (`T_image_right` / `T_table` × 2–3)
5. Discussion (`T_text`)
6. Limitations (`T_two_col_with_box` works well)
7. Take-home (`T_text` or `T_highlight_slide`)

### Output

Save to `output/presentation.pptx`. Speaker notes go into the notes pane only — never
modify slide design when adding notes.

### Step 3.5 — Slide critic (run before delivering deck)

After exporting the PPTX, run the slide critic rubric at
`references/critic_rubrics/slide.md`. Score each slide and the deck-level Mac
compatibility checks (Section F) as PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL. Produce concrete edits for
every FAIL or PARTIAL item before treating the deck as ready.

Mandatory deck-level checks (cross-link with `~/.claude/rules/pptx-mac-compatibility.md`):

```bash
# F.22 No TIFF
find ppt/media -iname '*.tif*' || true   # must be empty

# F.23 No 3-D bevel
grep -l '<a:sp3d>' ppt/slides/*.xml      # must be empty

# F.24 app.xml count sync
grep -c '<Slides>\|<Notes>' docProps/app.xml
ls ppt/slides/slide*.xml | wc -l         # must match

# F.25 srcRect bounds (any value > 100000 = bug)
grep -oE '"[0-9]{6,}"' ppt/slides/*.xml | head
```

Record `critic_pass: yes | partial | no` and `refine_rounds: N` in `_quick_review.md`.

### Step 3.6 — AI-tell audit (deterministic; run on the built deck, not the build script)

```bash
python3 scripts/check_slide_tells.py  output/presentation.pptx --json output/qc/slide_tells.json
python3 scripts/check_deck_budget.py  output/presentation.pptx --json output/qc/deck_budget.json \
        --archetype <from Q0> --minutes <from Q0>
```

`check_deck_budget.py` is the mechanical half of the archetype: slides against the clock
(`DECK_OVER_BUDGET`), words per slide against what *this* room can absorb while also listening
(`SLIDE_TOO_DENSE`), and the type floor for the back row (`TYPE_TOO_SMALL`). It takes an archetype
rather than a universal threshold because a single global number would have to be wrong for most
venues. `--list` prints the budgets.

Six verdicts, each one a mark reviewers say they can spot instantly. **Every one must be cleared or
consciously overruled**, with the reason written down:

| Verdict | What it found | The fix |
|---|---|---|
| `CHROME_ON_EVERY_SLIDE` | Eyebrow labels / brand footers on ≥60% of slides | Keep the page number and the dividers. Delete the rest. |
| `SCAFFOLD_PHRASE` | A slide (or note) narrating its own construction — "요약하자면", "The key takeaway is…" | Delete the sentence; say the thing it was pointing at. |
| `TOPIC_TITLE` | A content slide titled "Results" instead of stating the result | Assertion headline: *"Adjunctive ablation halved local recurrence (12% vs 26%)."* |
| `SHAPE_MONOTONY` | The same box, eight times, at the same size | Parallel ideas → one table. Non-parallel ideas → different shapes. |
| `DEAD_SPACE_BAND` | A mostly-empty slide with a hole through the middle | Say more, or say one thing large. |
| `ARROW_NO_SEMANTICS` | ≥2 arrows, none labelled | Label every arrow, or add a legend. An arrow is a claim. |

The detector is **stdlib-only** and reads any `.pptx`, so it also works on a deck a colleague sends
you, or one you did not build here.

**It is not a style opinion, and it does not detect "was AI used".** Used as a booster, AI leaves
none of these marks. Used as a button, it leaves all of them.

**Mode B: Add notes to existing slides** (more common)
- Read existing PPTX to understand slide structure and count
- Map speaker script sections to corresponding slides
- Generate `inject_notes.py` script tailored to the specific presentation

### Note Injection Script

Generate a tailored `inject_notes.py` following the pattern in
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/inject_speaker_notes.py`. The generated script should
contain only the `notes` dictionary customized for this presentation and the main
injection loop from the template.

### Critical Rule

**Speaker notes are injected without modifying slide design, layout, text, or images.**
The script only touches the notes pane. Verify by comparing slide content before and after.

**Mode C: Fill an institutional / branded template**

When the user supplied a `.pptx`/`.potx` at Step 0b (university, hospital, society
template with a fixed logo and theme), **fill it — do not redesign it**. This is
*patch-over-rebuild* (`~/.claude/rules/pptx-mac-compatibility.md` §2): a from-scratch
`Presentation()` would drop the institution's master, theme, and logo.

1. **Inspect**: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/inspect_pptx_template.py <template>`
   → lists every layout (index, name) with its placeholders (idx, type, size) plus theme
   fonts/colors. Read it before writing content.
2. **Map** each outline slide to one of the template's existing layouts (Title /
   Title+Content / Section Header / Closing). Do not invent layouts.
3. **Fill** by `placeholder_format.idx` (from the inspector) so the institution's fonts,
   sizes, and logo are inherited — never add free text boxes for title/body. Code pattern
   and the no-usable-body-layout fallback are in
   `references/slide_visual_styles/institutional_brand.md`.
4. **Notes**: inject with `scripts/inject_speaker_notes.py` as usual (notes are template-
   independent).
5. **Verify**: open in Mac PowerPoint (no repair dialog, logo on every slide, fonts
   intact); confirm the logo media is still embedded; sync `docProps/app.xml` after
   adding/deleting slides (`pptx-mac-compatibility.md` §5–5.1).

The content rules (`presentation_design_guidelines.md`) still apply inside the brand —
one idea per slide, redrawn tables, ≤3 colors *within* the institution's palette.

## Phase 4: Q&A Preparation

### Question Generation

Generate questions from multiple perspectives:

1. **Methodology critics**: "Why this design? Why not...?"
2. **Domain experts**: Deep technical questions about the specific field
3. **Generalists**: "What does this mean for clinical practice?"
4. **Students/trainees**: Clarification questions about unfamiliar concepts

### Answer Structure

Every answer should follow the pattern:

```
Acknowledge → Evidence → Conclude

"That's an important limitation. [Acknowledge the concern honestly.]
However, [cite specific supporting evidence — author, year, finding].
So while [restate limitation], [conclude with the paper's contribution despite it]."
```

### Quick Review Sheet

A single-page reference for last-minute review:

```text
## Quick Review

### Must-Know Numbers
| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| [Key stat 1] | [value] | [Ref] |
| [Key stat 2] | [value] | [Ref] |

### Common Pitfalls
- Don't confuse [X] with [Y]
- [Classification A] and [Classification B] are independent frameworks
- Slide says [rounded value], precise value is [exact value]

### Key Takeaways (memorize these)

## Cross-skill / Cross-rule integration

This skill composes with adjacent skills and global rules:

| When | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Need a figure on a slide (ROC, forest, KM, flow) | `/make-figures` first, then embed | Both skills share Reynolds/Knaflic/Tufte foundations; figure-level + slide-level companions |
| Manuscript reporting checklist parallel | `/check-reporting` for the same paper | Paper presentations often shadow manuscript revision; reporting-guideline gaps surface in Q&A |
| Visual abstract / Central Illustration | `/make-figures` visual-abstract templates | Then verify against `~/.claude/rules/journal-ai-image-policies.md` (JACC prohibits, Radiology allows with disclosure) |
| PPTX edits to existing institutional template | `~/.claude/rules/pptx-mac-compatibility.md` | Patch over rebuild; preserve master/layout/srcRect |
| Manuscript companion deck | `~/.claude/rules/manuscript-style-classical.md` | Heading style, AI-Disclosure policy, em-dash discipline carry over to slides for senior MA reviewer audiences |
| References on slides | `/verify-refs` (audit-only) before delivery | Same anti-hallucination gate as manuscript references |

## Constraints

- **Never fabricate references.** Every citation must be verified against PubMed, DOI, or the PDF itself.
- **Never modify slide design** when injecting notes. Notes and slides are separate concerns.
- **Always ask audience first.** Do not start drafting until the target audience is defined.
- **Extension sections are opt-in.** Do not add AI/clinical/policy sections unless explicitly requested.
- **Respect presentation time.** Script length must match allocated time (roughly 130-150 words per minute for academic presentations).

## Anti-Hallucination

- **Never fabricate references.** All citations must be verified via `/search-lit` with confirmed DOI or PMID. Mark unverified references as `[UNVERIFIED - NEEDS MANUAL CHECK]`.
- **Never invent clinical definitions, diagnostic criteria, or guideline recommendations.** If uncertain, flag with `[VERIFY]` and ask the user.
- **Never fabricate numerical results** — compliance percentages, scores, effect sizes, or sample sizes must come from actual data or analysis output.
- If a reporting guideline item, journal policy, or clinical standard is uncertain, state the uncertainty rather than guessing.
