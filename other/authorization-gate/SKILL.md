name: authorization-gate
description: Use as the pre-flight authorization check before any offensive, intrusive, or simulation activity — pentest, red team, exploitation, phishing simulation, wireless attacks, social engineering, C2, scanning a target you don't own. Confirms written authorization, scope boundaries, lawful basis, and target ownership before a single packet is sent, and defines the hard refusals (mass targeting, supply-chain compromise, malicious evasion). Run this gate at the top of any offensive or simulation workflow before acting.

# Authorization gate — clear before you act

This is the shared pre-flight every offensive or intrusive skill runs first. It does not replace the project's global policy in `AGENTS.md`; it makes the check explicit and uniform so no engagement starts on an assumption. If the gate doesn't pass, the offensive work does not start.

## The gate (all must be true)

Confirm each of these with the user before acting. If any is missing, stop and ask — do not infer authorization from the fact that someone asked.

1. **Written authorization exists.** A signed engagement letter, rules-of-engagement (ROE) document, bug bounty program scope, lab/CTF terms, or equivalent. "My boss said it's fine" verbally is not sufficient for production targets.
2. **Target is in scope.** The exact hosts, domains, IP ranges, apps, accounts, or cloud accounts are named in that authorization. Anything not listed is out of scope until added in writing.
3. **Lawful basis and ownership.** The user owns the target or is contracted by the owner. For data that is regulated or third-party (PII, health, finance), the authorization covers it.
4. **Time window and constraints.** When testing is permitted, what's prohibited (no DoS, no data exfiltration beyond PoC, no production-impacting actions, no lateral movement past a boundary), and the emergency stop / contact.
5. **Blast radius understood.** What could break, who is notified, and how to roll back.

When in doubt, treat it as unauthorized and ask. Training/CTF/lab and your-own-infrastructure contexts clear the gate trivially — name them and proceed.

## Hard refusals (no authorization clears these)

These are refused regardless of who asks or what paperwork exists, consistent with the project's operating rules:

- **Mass / indiscriminate targeting** — scanning or attacking ranges you have no per-target authorization for.
- **Supply-chain compromise** — poisoning packages, build systems, or update channels.
- **Destructive actions** — ransomware deployment, data destruction, DoS as an end in itself.
- **Detection evasion built for malicious persistence** — not the same as authorized red-team OPSEC, which stays inside ROE and is logged.
- Anything whose realistic purpose is harming a third party rather than testing an authorized one.

Authorized security testing, CTFs, defensive research, and dual-use tooling with a clear authorized scope are fine — these refusals target out-of-scope and malicious use, not the discipline.

## How offensive skills use this

At the start of an offensive/simulation workflow:

```text
1. Run authorization-gate. If it doesn't pass, stop and resolve before continuing.
2. Record scope + authorization reference in the engagement notes.
3. Proceed with the technical methodology, staying inside the recorded scope.
```

Pair with `[[offensive-reporting]]` for evidence hygiene during the engagement, and route confirmed findings through `[[finding-triage]]` → `[[security-comms]]` for disposition and stakeholder communication. For full-scope planning, `[[conducting-full-scope-red-team-engagement]]` and `[[executing-red-team-engagement-planning]]` carry the heaviest ROE discipline.
