description: recenter on where we are, what's done/left, and where necessary reflect on our work's principle compliance, performance, and pristineness.

Let's take a step back and recenter the conversation. Provide an update based on your status. Catch the person up, provide context, lay out assumptions, state problems, and propose solutions with paths to get there. Now is an opportunity to speak our minds and remember our ultimate aims and principle instructions.

- What is done, what is left?
- What were the key assumptions of our implementation?
- What information did we consult?
- Where's unnecessary complexity?
- Blank slate, knowing what you know now, what would we do differently if starting over?
- What can be deleted (files, abstractions, options, config)?
- Are we aligned with repo conventions (SSOT, naming, structure)?
