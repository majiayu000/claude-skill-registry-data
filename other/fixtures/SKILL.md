# Test Skill

This is a test skill for validation purposes.

## What This Skill Provides

- **Standard 1** - First standard
- **Standard 2** - Second standard
- **Standard 3** - Third standard

## When to Activate This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- Working with test scenarios
- Validating component structures
- Learning about skill patterns

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Requirements
Determine what standards are needed for the current task.

### Step 2: Load Relevant Standards
Based on the task:
- **Testing** → Read standards/testing.md
- **Validation** → Read standards/validation.md
- **Patterns** → Read standards/patterns.md

### Step 3: Apply Standards
Follow guidance from loaded standards.

## Standards Organization

```
standards/
├── testing.md          (Testing standards)
├── validation.md       (Validation standards)
└── patterns.md         (Pattern standards)
```

## Tool Access

**Read**: Load standard files on-demand
**Grep**: Search for specific patterns in standards

## Quality Verification

Skills are self-contained when:
- [ ] All standards in standards/ directory
- [ ] All paths use relative paths
- [ ] No external file references
- [ ] No cross-skill duplication
