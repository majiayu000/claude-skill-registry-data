name: latchkey
description: Interact with third-party or self-hosted services (Slack, Google Workspace, Dropbox, GitHub, Linear, Coolify...) using their HTTP APIs on the user's behalf.
compatibility: Requires node.js, curl and latchkey (npm install -g latchkey). A desktop/GUI environment is required for the browser functionality.

# Latchkey

## Instructions

Latchkey is a CLI tool that automatically injects credentials into curl commands. Credentials (mostly API tokens) can be either manually managed or, for some services, Latchkey can open a browser login pop-up window and extract API credentials from the session.

Use this skill when the user asks you to work on their behalf with services that have HTTP APIs, like AWS, GitLab, Google Drive, Discord or others.

Usage:

1. **Use `latchkey curl`** instead of regular `curl` for supported services.
2. **Pass through all regular curl arguments** - latchkey is a transparent wrapper.
3. **Check for `latchkey services list`** to get a list of supported services. Use `--viable` to only show the currently configured ones.
4. **Use `latchkey services info <service_name>`** to get information about a specific service (auth options, credentials status, API docs links, special requirements, etc.).
5. **If necessary, ask the user to configure credentials first.** Tell the user to run `latchkey auth set` on the machine where latchkey is installed (using the setCredentialsExample from the `services info` command).
6. **Alternatively, let the user log in with the browser.** If supported for the given service, run `latchkey auth browser <service_name>` to open a browser login pop-up window.
7. **Look for the newest documentation of the desired public API online.** If using the `browser` auth command, avoid bot-only endpoints.
8. **Do not initiate a new login if the credentials status is `valid` or `unknown`** - the user might just not have the necessary permissions for the action you're trying to do.


## Examples

### Make an authenticated curl request
```bash
latchkey curl [curl arguments]
```

### Creating a Slack channel
```bash
latchkey curl -X POST 'https://slack.com/api/conversations.create' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"my-channel"}'
```

(Notice that `-H 'Authorization: Bearer` is not present in the invocation.)

### Getting Discord user info
```bash
latchkey curl 'https://discord.com/api/v10/users/@me'
```

### Detect expired credentials and force a new login to Discord
```bash
latchkey services info discord  # Check the "credentialStatus" field - shows "invalid"
latchkey auth browser discord
latchkey curl 'https://discord.com/api/v10/users/@me'
```

Only do this when you notice that your previous call ended up not being authenticated (HTTP 401 or 403).

### List usable services

```bash
latchkey services list --viable
```

Lists services that either have stored credentials or can be authenticated via a browser.

### Get service-specific info
```bash
latchkey services info slack
```

Returns auth options, credentials status, and developer notes
about the service. If `browser` is not present in the
`authOptions` field, the service requires the user to directly
set API credentials via `latchkey auth set` or `latchkey auth
set-nocurl` before making requests.


## Storing credentials

Aside from the `latchkey auth browser` case, it is the user's responsibility to supply credentials.
The user would typically do something like this:

```bash
latchkey auth set my-gitlab-instance -H "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <token>"
```

When credentials cannot be expressed as static curl arguments, the user would use the `set-nocurl` subcommand. For example:

```bash
latchkey auth set-nocurl aws <access-key-id> <secret-access-key>
```

If a service doesn't appear with the `--viable` flag, it may
still be supported; the user just hasn't provided the
credentials yet. `latchkey service info <service_name>` can be
used to see how to provide credentials for a specific service.


## Using multiple accounts

It is possible to associate credentials with a specific account:

```bash
latchkey --account alice@example.com auth set ...
```

And then reference it in curl calls:

```bash
latchkey --account alice@example.com curl ...
```

The `--account` option must go right after `latchkey`.

You can see the existing accounts as keys in the credential
dictionary produced by `latchkey services info`. An empty string
in the key means "unknown account".


## Notes

- All curl arguments are passed through unchanged
- Return code, stdout and stderr are passed back from curl
- Credentials are always stored encrypted and are never transmitted anywhere beyond the endpoints specified by the actual curl calls.

## Currently supported services

Latchkey currently offers varying levels of support for the
following services: AWS, Calendly, Coolify, Discord, Dropbox, Figma, GitHub, GitLab,
Gmail, Google Analytics, Google Calendar, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Hugging Face,
Linear, Mailchimp, ngrok, Notion, OpenRouter, Ramp, Sentry, Slack, Stripe, Telegram, Tailscale, Todoist, Umami, Yelp, Zoom, and more.

### User-registered services

Note for humans: users can also add limited support for new services
at runtime using the `latchkey services register` command.
