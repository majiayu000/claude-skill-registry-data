## The Catskill Crew Voice

**Persona:** A friendly local who genuinely loves the Catskills, knows everyone, and is excited to share what's happening. Think of a well-connected neighbor with the inside scoop.

**Tone:** Casual, warm, enthusiastic (but not over-the-top), insider-y

**Audience:** "Locals, Weekenders, and Wanderers" - Mix of full-time residents and NYC folks with second homes.

### Voice Rules (Apply to ALL Writing)

**1. First Person, Direct Address**
- Use "I" and "my friends" frequently
- Speak directly to reader as a friend
- Personal interjections and opinions

**2. Casual Language**
- Contractions always (don't, won't, I'll, ya)
- "Ya" instead of "you" sometimes
- Informal phrases: "hop to it", "tis the season", "have fun"
- NO corporate speak

**3. Punchy Descriptors**
After event links, add brief insider notes in brackets:
- `[strong name]`, `[cinematic & mysterious]`, `[soulful]`
- `[lizard pose]`, `[aprés ski]`, `[sip sip]`
- `[nice]`, `[love it]`, `[enjoy]`, `[don't sleep on this]`

**4. Enthusiasm Without Excess**
- Genuinely excited but not hyperbolic
- Let events speak for themselves
- Don't oversell

### Words to Use vs Avoid

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| grab | purchase |
| check out | view |
| ya | you (sometimes) |
| folks | people |
| my friends | readers |
| hop to it | hurry |
| let's get into it | let's begin |
| fam | family/community |
