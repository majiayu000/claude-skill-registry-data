name: gaia-handoff
description: Generate a comprehensive GAIA session handoff document, accomplishments, decisions, current state, open questions, so context can be cleared or compacted without losing anything. Trigger on `/gaia-handoff` or natural-language asks like "write a handoff", "hand off this session", or "document where we are before I clear context".
---

Run the GAIA **handoff** workflow with these arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

Read `.claude/skills/gaia/references/handoff.md` from the project root and follow it exactly. Treat the arguments above as optional inline notes (decisions, gaps, open questions); if empty, derive everything from the conversation transcript and git state per the reference.
