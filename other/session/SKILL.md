<objective>

Carry the *durable* part of a session across `/clear`, hold open loops until they land. `dump` composes a small handover doc from the live conversation, writes it to `.claude/state/session/<slug>.md`, ends by printing `/clear`. The `session-restore.js` hook (SessionStart, matcher `clear`) injects that doc into the fresh session, so restore is free. Implementation detail — diffs, tool output, exploration transcript, abandoned approaches — dropped on purpose; only the decision that settled an approach survives.

Runs **inline, never `context: fork`**. Conversation history *is* the authoritative source for what changed, what was decided, what never landed; a forked run would see none of it.

NOT for: auto-compact survival (`compaction.md` skill contract); reviving a finished conversation (native `/resume`). Boundary table in the notes section below.

</objective>

<inputs>

- **$ARGUMENTS**: required. Six modes:
  - `dump [name]` — sweep, compose and write handover doc, set `LATEST` pointer, print `/clear` next step. `name` optional; unnamed dumps derive a slug from branch + UTC timestamp.
  - `recall [name]` — print a stored handover into context, mark it consumed. Named, or `LATEST` when omitted. Manual path for dumps the hook skips.
  - `list` — table of stored handovers (slug, age, consumed) plus open parked items.
  - `park <idea>` — append one open-loop item to `.claude/state/session/PARKED.md`. No dump needed; works any time.
  - `sweep` — read conversation for unlanded ideas, unanswered questions, pending tasks; report them, offer to park.
  - `drop <item>` — fuzzy-match a parked item, remove it, log the closure.

</inputs>

<constants>

- Store dir: `.claude/state/session/` (project-local; `.claude/state/` gitignored, same as `session-context.md`)
- Item store: `.claude/state/session/PARKED.md` — one bullet per open item; survives every dump, never auto-deleted
- Pointer file: `.claude/state/session/LATEST` — plain text, slug of most recent unconsumed dump. Blank or missing = nothing pending.
- Closure log: `.claude/state/session/dropped.jsonl` — one JSON line per `drop`
- Doc size cap: ~1.5K tokens (~75 lines). Compress prose, never drop a decision.
- Hook auto-restore window: unconsumed **and** `created` within 30 min. Outside it, `recall` is the manual path.
- Hook truncation threshold: ~8000 chars — above it hook injects `## Goal` + files table + `## Next step` + a `→ /foundry:session recall <slug>` pointer instead of the whole doc.
- Stale threshold: 14 days (`⚠ stale` prefix when listing) — applies to handover docs **and** parked items
- Delete threshold: 30 days — handover docs only, swept during `list`. **Parked items never auto-deleted**; only `drop` removes one.
- Files-table row cap: 25 (over that, group by directory, state elided count)

</constants>

<workflow>

**Task hygiene** — task tools may be deferred; load before first use: `ToolSearch(query="select:TaskList,TaskCreate,TaskUpdate,TaskGet", max_results=4)`. Call `TaskList` first and triage each task it returns: `completed` if work clearly done, `deleted` if orphaned, keep `in_progress` only if genuinely continuing. Never spend a turn on bookkeeping alone — every `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` ships in the same response as the next substantive tool call; one exception, `TaskUpdate(completed)` immediately before a long output block (`rules/task-lifecycle.md`).

## Step 0: Validate and dispatch mode

Extract first word of `$ARGUMENTS` as `MODE`.

If `MODE` matches:

- `dump` (alias: `save`) → **Mode: dump**
- `recall` (aliases: `restore`, `load`) → **Mode: recall**
- `list` → **Mode: list**
- `park` → **Mode: park**
- `sweep` → **Mode: sweep**
- `drop` (alias: `archive`) → **Mode: drop**

**Unsupported flag check** — after extracting mode token, scan `$ARGUMENTS` for remaining `--<token>` patterns. Found: print `` ! Unknown flag(s): `--<token>`. Supported modes: dump, recall, list, park, sweep, drop. `` then invoke `AskUserQuestion` — (a) **Abort** (stop, re-invoke correctly) · (b) **Continue ignoring** (skip unknown flags, proceed with recognized mode).

Otherwise (empty, unrecognized, misspelled): use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Which session mode did you want?"
>
> Options: (a) `dump [name]` — write the handover doc now, (b) `park <idea>` — stash one open loop without derailing, (c) `sweep` — audit the conversation for unlanded work, (d) `list` — stored handovers and open items

## Step 1 / Mode: dump

### Substep 1a: Derive slug and timestamp

```bash
git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null; date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ; date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%SZ  # timeout: 5000
```

Three lines out: branch, ISO `created` stamp, filesystem-safe stamp. Slug: `<name>` from `$ARGUMENTS` when given (lowercase, non-alphanumerics → `-`); otherwise `<branch with / → ->-<filesystem-safe stamp>`. Empty branch (detached HEAD): `detached`. Reject a `name` containing `/` or `..` — re-ask via `AskUserQuestion` rather than writing outside store dir. `LATEST`, `PARKED`, `dropped` are reserved slugs; re-ask on those too.

### Substep 1b: Sweep for unlanded work

Run **Step 5 / Mode: sweep** internally, plus Read `.claude/state/session/PARKED.md` (skip silently if absent). Union becomes doc's `## Outstanding` section. Nothing found and no parked items: omit section.

### Substep 1c: Gather file evidence

```bash
git diff --stat HEAD 2>/dev/null; echo "--- committed since session start ---"; git log --name-only --pretty=format:'%h %s' --since="8 hours ago" 2>/dev/null | head -60  # timeout: 5000
```

> git parses the relative date itself — no BSD/GNU `date` flag split needed.

**Sourcing precedence for files table** — union of four sources, in this order:

1. **Conversation history — authoritative.** Every `Edit`/`Write` of this session is visible to this skill; that's the touched-file list, and the only source that also knows *what* each change was (`Change`) and whether it landed (`State`).
2. `git diff --stat HEAD` → `Ref` column (`+N/-M`). A file with no diff entry and no commit is `Ref: uncommitted-new`, or dropped when it was temp scratch.
3. `git log --name-only --since=…` → files already committed this session, no longer appearing in `git diff HEAD`.
4. `.claude/state/session-context.md` → `## Files Modified This Session` — **fallback only**. `task-log.js` writes that section from its PreCompact branch, firing at 85% auto-compact threshold; a session dumping before any compaction has no such section, or a stale one from a prior session. Read only when sources 1–3 come up empty.

**Column rules**: `Change` ≤6 words, what changed, never why (why belongs in `## Decisions`). `State` ∈ `done` / `wip` / `needs-test` / `reverted`. Cap 25 rows — over that, group by directory, state elided count explicitly, never silently truncate (`quality-gates.md`). Scratchpad and `.temp/` paths are never rows; belong in `## Artifacts`.

### Substep 1d: Gather artifacts and open tasks

```bash
find .temp .reports .experiments .developments -maxdepth 2 -type d -mtime -1 2>/dev/null | head -20  # timeout: 5000
```

Call `TaskList` for tasks still `in_progress` or `pending` — they feed `## Next step` and `## Outstanding`, not a section of their own (task state survives on its own).

### Substep 1e: Compose the doc

Fill this template. Omit any section with nothing real in it — an empty heading is noise next session pays for.

```markdown
---
slug: <slug>
created: <ISO8601-UTC>
consumed: false
branch: <git branch>
---

## Goal
[goal or plan]

## Decisions
- [decision] — why: [reason]

## Lessons / corrections
- [correction received] — rule going forward: [rule]

## Standing instructions
- [standing directive]

## Files touched

| File | Change | State | Ref |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `path/to/a.py` | added retry guard | done | +42/-3 |
| `path/to/b.md` | README sync | wip | +8/-0 |

## Outstanding
- **[slug]** — [summary]. Why: [reason]. Next: [next action].

## Artifacts

| Path | Kind | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.reports/<skill>/<ts>/report.md` | report | consolidated findings |
| `.temp/<skill>/<ts>/` | run-dir | agent handover files |

## Next step
[next action]

## Dropped deliberately
implementation detail, tool output, exploration transcript
```

> Section rules:
>
> - Keep `## Goal` to 1–3 lines.
> - Under `## Standing instructions`, include only programmatic-level directives that must keep applying.
> - Each `## Outstanding` item has a one-line summary, a one-sentence reason, and the next ask or action.
> - Keep `## Next step` to one concrete action.

**Written in ultra-caveman tier** (`plugins/CLAUDE.md` §Writing Style) — this doc is re-injected into a fresh context on every restore, so every word is a recurring cost. Explicit exclusions: no diffs, no code bodies, no command output, no per-file reasoning, no history of abandoned approaches — only the decision that settled them.

### Substep 1f: Write the doc and the pointer

Use **Write tool** for both (it creates `.claude/state/session/` on demand; no `mkdir` permission gap):

1. `.claude/state/session/<slug>.md` — composed doc. A slug that already exists is overwritten only after `AskUserQuestion` confirms; otherwise append `-2`, `-3`, … .
2. `.claude/state/session/LATEST` — slug alone, one line.

`PARKED.md` is **not** cleared by a dump — doc copies items, doesn't consume them. An item leaves only via `drop`.

### Substep 1g: Print the next step

Terminal only, short. Confirm path, row count of files table, then:

```text
→ .claude/state/session/<slug>.md (N files, M decisions, K outstanding)
Next: clear the context. I cannot run it for you — Claude Code exposes no programmatic slash invocation, so the line below is yours to send. The SessionStart hook re-injects this doc automatically on the other side.

/clear
```

The literal `/clear` is the **last line of the reply** — nothing after it, so it's one copy away.

End with a `## Confidence` block per `quality-gates.md` — score on: files table backed by conversation evidence (not guessed), decisions captured with their reasons, sweep run before composing, next step concrete enough to act on cold.

## Step 2 / Mode: recall

### Substep 2a: Resolve the target

Named → `.claude/state/session/<name>.md`. Unnamed → read `.claude/state/session/LATEST` (Read tool), use the slug it holds; blank or missing: print `No pending handover. → /foundry:session list`, stop.

Missing target file: print the miss, fall through to a `list` render so user sees what does exist.

### Substep 2b: Print it into context

Read the doc, print its body verbatim, frontmatter stripped, under a one-line banner naming slug and age. **Terminal only — never route this to a file**: landing it in context *is* the mechanism, output-routing to `.temp/` would defeat it.

### Substep 2c: Mark consumed

1. Edit tool on the doc: `consumed: false` → `consumed: true` (frontmatter only).
2. Read `.claude/state/session/LATEST` (reuse the Substep 2a read when the target was unnamed) and compare its content to the resolved slug. **Only when they match**: Write tool on `.claude/state/session/LATEST` with empty content — hook treats blank and missing alike, so nothing re-injects on next `/clear`. When `LATEST` points to a different, still-unconsumed slug: leave it untouched — recalling an unrelated named doc must never silently drop the pointer to a different pending handover.

End with a `## Confidence` block per `quality-gates.md` — score on: target resolved unambiguously, doc printed intact, consumed marker written.

## Step 3 / Mode: list

### Substep 3a: Sweep expired handover docs (≥ 30 days)

```bash
find .claude/state/session -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' ! -name 'PARKED.md' -mtime +30 -delete 2>/dev/null; echo "sweep done"  # timeout: 5000
```

> `PARKED.md` excluded by name — parked items have no TTL, only `drop` removes them.

### Substep 3b: Collect and render

Glob `.claude/state/session/*.md` **excluding `PARKED.md`** (it holds bullets, not frontmatter), Read each one's frontmatter for `slug`, `created`, `consumed`, `branch`. Age comes from `created`, not file mtime — marking a doc consumed rewrites the file, would reset mtime. Read `PARKED.md` separately for items table; its ages come from each bullet's `Raised:` date.

```markdown
## Session store — [date]

### Handovers

| Slug | Age | Branch | Consumed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `plan-x` | 12 min | main | no |
| `⚠ stale refactor-auth` | 16 d | feat/auth | yes |

### Parked ([open item count])

- [ ] **retry-backoff** — revisit exponential vs linear. Raised: 2026-08-10.
- [ ] ⚠ stale **split-ratio** — 80/20 vs 70/30 never settled. Raised: 2026-07-20.

→ /foundry:session recall <slug> to print a handover back into context
→ /foundry:session drop <item> to close a parked item
```

`⚠ stale` prefix at ≥14 days, both tables. Nothing in either: `No stored handovers, no parked items.`

End with a `## Confidence` block per `quality-gates.md` — score on: glob returned a result (even empty), every frontmatter parsed, ages computed from `created` / `Raised:`.

## Step 4 / Mode: park

Payload is everything after `park ` in `$ARGUMENTS`. Empty payload: run **Mode: sweep** instead, offer its findings as parking candidates, rather than asking for text conversation already holds.

Derive a short kebab slug from payload, then Read `.claude/state/session/PARKED.md` (absent: start a fresh file with `# Parked items` heading), Edit/Write one bullet appended at end:

```markdown
# Parked items

- **[slug]** — [summary]. Raised: [date]. Why: [reason]. Next: [next action].
```

> Keep each summary to one line and each Why to one sentence. Next states what to ask or do when revisiting.

Date from `date -u +%Y-%m-%d` (fold into any bash call this step already makes). Slug already present: update that bullet rather than adding a near-duplicate, say so.

Print one line: `Parked: [slug]` plus current open count. Terminal only.

## Step 5 / Mode: sweep

Read the **conversation**, not the filesystem. Nothing to run — history already in context. Collect, in this order:

| Type | Trigger |
| -- | -- |
| Unanswered question | Claude asked, user sent a new top-level request instead of answering |
| Deferred exploration | "come back to that", "park this", "later" — idea named, not pursued |
| Diverging idea | feature/design idea raised while solving something else |
| Unfinished task | `TaskList` entry still `pending` / `in_progress` |
| Stated-but-unlanded | a change discussed and agreed, with no Edit/Write backing it in this session |

Call `TaskList` for fourth row. Detection stays **behavioural** — a new top-level request without an answer to prior question — never semantic-similarity scoring.

Render:

```markdown
## Unlanded — [item count] items

| # | Item | Type | Why it did not land |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | retry backoff shape | deferred | user said "later, after the bench lands" |
```

Then `AskUserQuestion`: (a) park all · (b) park a subset (list the numbers) · (c) skip. Selecting (a) or (b) runs **Mode: park** for each chosen item in the same turn.

When a `session-restore.js`-injected handover doc is present at the start of this conversation (a freshly restored session), its `## Decisions` and `## Outstanding` sections are part of the candidate set too — an item listed there and not yet re-confirmed as landed in the live turns since restore still counts as stated-but-unlanded. Do not require post-restore Edit/Write evidence for something the restored doc's own `## Files touched` table already marked `done`.

Sweep sees the **current conversation only**. A finished session's unlanded ideas are unreachable — native `/resume` revives the conversation itself; this skill never mines transcript JSONL.

End with a `## Confidence` block per `quality-gates.md` — score on: every row traceable to a concrete conversation turn (not inferred), `TaskList` consulted, no already-landed work listed as outstanding.

## Step 6 / Mode: drop

### Substep 6a: Fuzzy-match the target

Match everything after `drop ` against slugs and summaries in `.claude/state/session/PARKED.md`. Ambiguous (2+ equally close): list them, `AskUserQuestion` to disambiguate. No match: render parked list, stop.

### Substep 6b: Remove the bullet and log the closure

Edit tool on `PARKED.md` — remove only matched bullet, leave rest untouched. Then append one audit line:

```bash
TS=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
jq -n --arg ts "$TS" --arg item "<matched slug>" '{"ts":$ts,"item":$item,"action":"dropped"}' >> .claude/state/session/dropped.jsonl  # timeout: 5000
```

> jq escapes the slug — a bullet holding quotes or braces can never break the log line.

Print `Dropped: [slug]` plus remaining open count. Terminal only.

End with a `## Confidence` block per `quality-gates.md` — score on: match unambiguous, only the matched bullet removed, audit line appended.

</workflow>

<notes>

**Why not one command.** A skill cannot invoke `/clear` — Claude Code exposes no programmatic slash invocation (that's Agent SDK `query()` only), and neither keybindings, `UserPromptSubmit`, nor `UserPromptExpansion` can trigger one either. So `dump` + `/clear` stays two steps; the mechanism buys its keep by making the *third* step (restore) automatic.

**Why inline, not forked.** `context: fork` skills can't read conversation history. Files table's `Change` and `State` columns, decisions, lessons, and the whole of `sweep` come from that history — a forked run would have nothing to write.

**Two state mechanisms — they do not overlap.**

| Mechanism | Survives | Trigger | Store |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Skill contract (`compaction.md`) | in-flight skill phase state | auto-compact at 85% | `.temp/state/skill-contract.md` |
| Session handover (this skill) | plan, decisions, lessons, files table, open loops | explicit `dump` before `/clear` | `.claude/state/session/` |

**Restore is best-effort, dump is not.** Hook injects only when pointer exists, doc unconsumed, and under 30 minutes old — a deliberately narrow window, so an old dump never ambushes an unrelated session. Everything outside it is reachable by `/foundry:session recall <slug>`, which has no age gate. The four cases landing there: dumped and walked away (>30 min); doc over ~8K chars (hook injects head plus a pointer); fresh terminal rather than a `/clear` (matcher is `clear`); wanting the same doc a second time (first restore set `consumed: true`).

**`recall`, not `resume`.** Claude Code's native `/resume` revives a whole past conversation — strictly better recall than any document. This mode name stays clear of it deliberately; the two aren't alternatives.

**Parking is a command, not a behaviour.** The predecessor made parking an automatic behavioural rule documented only inside this file, which loads only on invocation — so it never fired, and store held zero items for four months. `park` is now an explicit mode with an explicit store. Nothing writes to `PARKED.md` unless user asks for it, no TTL deletes from it.

**Scope**: store is project-local — `.claude/state/session/` lives inside working tree, so nothing leaks across projects.
