# SQL Queries Skill

Write correct, performant, readable SQL across all major data warehouse dialects.

## Dialect-Specific Reference

### PostgreSQL
- Date arithmetic: `date_column + INTERVAL '7 days'`, `DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at)`
- String: `ILIKE`, regex with `~`, `SPLIT_PART()`
- JSON: `data->>'key'`, `data#>>'{path,to,key}'`
- Arrays: `ARRAY_AGG()`, `ANY()`, `@>` containment
- Performance: `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, partial indexes, `EXISTS` over `IN`

### Snowflake
- Date arithmetic: `DATEADD(day, 7, date_column)`, `DATEDIFF()`
- Semi-structured: `column:key::string` dot notation, `LATERAL FLATTEN()`
- Performance: clustering keys, partition pruning, `RESULT_SCAN()`

### BigQuery
- Date arithmetic: `DATE_ADD()`, `DATE_DIFF()`, `DATE_TRUNC(date, MONTH)`
- No ILIKE — use `LOWER()`, `REGEXP_CONTAINS()`
- Arrays: `UNNEST()`, `ARRAY_AGG()`
- Performance: always filter on partition columns, `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT()`, avoid `SELECT *`

### Redshift
- Date arithmetic: `DATEADD()`, `DATEDIFF()`, `DATE_TRUNC()`
- String: `ILIKE`, `LISTAGG()`
- Performance: `DISTKEY`, `SORTKEY`, `ANALYZE`, `VACUUM`

### Databricks SQL
- Delta Lake: time travel with `TIMESTAMP AS OF`, `MERGE INTO` for upserts
- Performance: `OPTIMIZE`, `ZORDER`, `CACHE TABLE`

## Common SQL Patterns

### Window Functions
```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at DESC)
SUM(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
LAG(value, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY entity ORDER BY date)
revenue / SUM(revenue) OVER () as pct_of_total
```

### CTEs for Readability
```sql
WITH
base_users AS (SELECT ...),
user_metrics AS (SELECT ... FROM base_users ...),
summary AS (SELECT ... FROM user_metrics ...)
SELECT * FROM summary;
```

### Cohort Retention
```sql
WITH cohorts AS (
    SELECT user_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', first_activity_date) as cohort_month
    FROM users
),
activity AS (
    SELECT user_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', activity_date) as activity_month
    FROM user_activity
)
SELECT cohort_month, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as cohort_size,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN activity_month = cohort_month THEN user_id END) as month_0,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN activity_month = cohort_month + INTERVAL '1 month' THEN user_id END) as month_1
FROM cohorts LEFT JOIN activity USING (user_id)
GROUP BY cohort_month;
```

### Funnel Analysis
Use conditional aggregation with `MAX(CASE WHEN event = 'X' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` per step, then compute conversion rates between steps.

### Deduplication
```sql
WITH ranked AS (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY entity_id ORDER BY updated_at DESC) as rn
    FROM source_table
)
SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE rn = 1;
```

## Error Handling and Debugging

1. **Syntax errors**: Check dialect-specific syntax differences
2. **Column not found**: Verify column names, check case sensitivity
3. **Type mismatches**: Cast explicitly (`CAST(col AS DATE)`)
4. **Division by zero**: Use `NULLIF(denominator, 0)`
5. **Ambiguous columns**: Always qualify with table alias in JOINs
6. **Group by errors**: All non-aggregated columns must be in GROUP BY
