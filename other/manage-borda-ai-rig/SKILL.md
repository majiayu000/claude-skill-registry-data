# Manage

Guarded Codex config management for agents, skills, rules, and local config.

The installed plugin tree is immutable input. Resolve requested targets against consuming project or explicit user-approved external scope; never edit this skill's plugin cache, packaged role cards, shared helpers, runtime assets, or package manifests. Codex Rig agent links are managed only by bundled `agent-shims` workflow, not by this general-purpose skill.

## Input Schema

```json
{
  "intent": "create|update|delete|rename|add-permission|remove-permission",
  "target": "required agent, skill, rule, config key, or path",
  "change": "required description or spec path",
  "execution": "optional auto|serial|parallel-read|parallel-write; default auto",
  "done_when": "target and all references are updated or explicitly left unchanged"
}
```

## Lightweight Local Work

Use a parent-only path for a small, understood, reversible local change with bounded impact and existing task authorization. A code fix plus its regression test remains one change. Routing examples are optional; tests and documentation for one change do not create separate domains.

1. Inspect the affected flow and applicable instructions; define the requested outcome. Investigate an unknown cause before editing.
2. Make the smallest authorized change. Run the relevant acceptance check and configured lint/format checks; inspect the diff.
3. Report the outcome, verification, and material limits concisely. Do not create execution plans, specialist packs, confidence worksheets, five-entry gate bundles, or final-handoff/result artifacts solely for this path. Reuse still-valid checks for unchanged source and environment.

This path takes precedence over the detailed workflow and role examples below. Select the detailed workflow for broad or risky changes, an explicitly requested structured report/review, or work requiring independent specialist coverage. Actual runtime permissions, protected-state decisions, and project-required checks still apply. Missing parallel controls select parent-serial work; they do not require another permission request for already-authorized local edits.

## Parallel Adoption (Portable read-only)

<!-- policy-sibling: skills/implement/SKILL.md (Parallel Adoption section) — near-duplicate; also see skills/code-review/SKILL.md Workflow parallel-review section as a third divergent variant; check siblings before editing this section alone -->

This skill permits only its promoted portable read-only route. Resolve execution precedence from per-invocation `--execution=<mode>`, then `CODEX_RIG_EXECUTION`, then the `auto` default. The default execution mode is `auto`. `auto` selects this route only after this consumer's runtime matrix and promotion; otherwise it resolves safely to `serial`. Serial parent work uses existing task authorization; exact-plan-digest approval applies when the promoted parallel-read route is selected. This route never bypasses consumer promotion, serial parent authority, or applicable write approval. Supplied denials or stale approvals remain invalid in every execution mode.

Follow the [canonical G0–G8 execution flow](../../ARCHITECTURE.md#canonical-g0g8-execution-flow) for shared gate order and fork outcomes. This consumer's read-only inventory passes are bounded by G0–G5; parent owns deterministic G6 integration, G7 verification, and G8 verdict/promotion.

### Safe parallel work

The promoted route permits read-only inventory, reference, ownership, and policy-impact scans over immutable disjoint targets with separate outputs. Disjoint propagation is not enabled; config, policy, documentation, calibration, cache, generated-output, artifact, and result writes remain outside this portable route.

### Required barrier

Apply shared [host compatibility check](../../shared/specialist-orchestration.md#host-compatibility-before-dispatch) before preparing any child work. Include `read_host` only from verified launcher-supported child controls. Missing or incompatible controls make `auto` resolve serial with reason; explicit parallel-read stops before dispatch. A plan declaration is not effective-control proof, and post-run validation remains mandatory.

Before any dispatch, freeze intent, target, baseline, ownership map, exact references, calibration and routing impact, context packs, role-card hashes, checks, resource locks, and plan digest. Dispatch at most one fixed dependency-ready wave, then join every terminal scan before edits, propagation, gates, or acceptance; changed scope requires new plan.

The frozen `<run-directory>/execution-plan.json` must include exact `consumer_policy` values `consumer_id=manage`, `capability=portable-read-only`, `promotion_status=promoted`, `parent_mutations=serial`, and `canonical_gates=serial`. It must also include `write_policy`: use `parent_writes=planned` with `approval_requirement=exact-plan-digest` when any parent mutation is planned, otherwise `parent_writes=none` with `approval_requirement=not-required`. When parallel-read is selected, a planned parent write requires `<run-directory>/write-approval.json` containing only exact plan SHA-256, `response=approve`, and `source=explicit-input|user-prompt`. Serial execution or an automatic serial fallback does not require a new digest receipt for already-authorized work.

Bootstrap exception: run-directory creation (Step 01), the `inventory.txt`/`references.txt`/`ownership.md` writes from Step 03, and the `write-approval.json` write itself are exempt from requiring a prior approved plan digest — these precursor writes must exist before a plan digest can be computed or approved.

Before dispatch, run `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/parallel_execution.py preflight --consumer manage --plan <run-directory>/execution-plan.json --approval <run-directory>/write-approval.json`; append `--execution=<mode>` only for explicit invocation value. Omit `--approval` when no parent writes are planned or effective execution is serial and no approval was supplied. Resolve host fallback before deciding whether the parallel route needs a receipt. A nonzero result stops route.

After every spawned child reaches a terminal handoff, run `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/parallel_execution.py validate-runtime --consumer manage --manifest <run-directory>/execution-manifest.json --plan <run-directory>/execution-plan.json --parent-rollout <authoritative-parent-rollout> --sessions-dir <authoritative-sessions-directory> --run-dir <run-directory> --roles-dir PLUGIN_ROOT/roles`. Require `runtime_promotion_eligible=true`, `consumer_id=manage`, and `write_parallel_eligible=false`. Run the same preflight again after the terminal join and before the first parent mutation. Any plan, approval, consumer, runtime, or join drift stops mutation and requires a new frozen plan plus exact approval.

### Serial parent decisions

Parent owns all create, update, delete, rename, and permission mutations; same-file policy or config changes; shared `AGENTS.md`, README, and config edits; calibration version advancement; propagation; artifacts and result writes; canonical quality gates; verdict; and promotion. Installed plugin-root and generated `codex-rig-*.toml` safety decisions remain serial and unchanged.

### Resource conflicts

Declare only validated resource locks such as `git-index`, `cache:<path>`, `generated:<path>`, and `test-env:<name>`. Shared targets, paths, indexes, caches, generated outputs, test environments, ports, devices, or undeclared resources force serial execution or re-planning.

### Fallback

Unavailable or unsafe fan-out uses equal-gate `serial-fallback` from the same frozen plan with the same quality gates and retained evidence. Never label fallback as parallel or weaken checks because dispatch was unavailable.

### Acceptance

This skill's shared runtime matrix and consumer promotion must remain complete before `auto` selects this route. Acceptance must prove freeze, complete join, truthful execution label, resource compatibility, equal gates, and unchanged serial parent authority.

### Stop rule

Generic parallel writes remain disabled. Stop without dispatch on missing promotion, mutable packs, ownership or resource overlap, sensitive or unproven controls, missing terminal evidence, or incomplete join; create, update, delete, rename, permission, and all other mutations remain parent-serial.

## Workflow

### 01: Create run directory

Run `create_run.py --skill manage` per `../../shared/helper-cli-contract.md`. For parallel-adoption execution-mode selection (`auto`/`serial`/`parallel-read`/`parallel-write`), see the Parallel Adoption section above before proceeding.

### 02: Parse intent and target

Intents:

- `create`: scaffold new skill/agent/rule/config entry.
- `update`: edit existing target.
- `rename`: move target and update references.
- `delete`: remove target only after dependency scan.
- `add-permission` / `remove-permission`: modify permission policy with rationale.

Unknown intent => fail before edit.

### 03: Resolve owned files and blast radius

Run `rg --files` with the `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/**`, and `.agents/**` globs as argv command; sort its lines and write them to `<run-directory>/inventory.txt`. Run `rg -n` for exact target over `.codex`, `.agents`, and `AGENTS.md`, write results to `<run-directory>/references.txt`, and record unavailable inputs or command failure explicitly.

Write `<run-directory>/ownership.md`: exact edited and intentionally untouched files.

Resolve the current skill path and reject any target whose canonical path is inside the same installed plugin root. Reject generated `codex-rig-*.toml` targets here even when they are outside the cache; report the bundled `agent-shims` workflow as the only permitted owner.

### 04: Run safety gates before editing

Deletion safety required for `delete` and `rename`.

- Delete/rename: no unresolved references or explicit migration plan.
- Permission changes: reason, use case, risk note; `security-auditor` is available for advisory review of the permission change only when the user explicitly requests that pass, under the same explicit-request gating as other specialist routing in `../../shared/specialist-orchestration.md` — not mandatory for every permission change.
- Public behavior change: consider docs/routing/calibration.
- Versioned calibration fixtures are committed-history markers: compare current value to `git show HEAD:<path>`; while uncommitted, advance at most one step from last committed value.
- A new-commit request never authorizes rewriting existing commit. Amend, rebase, reset, squash, fixup, and equivalent history edits require explicit request for that exact operation.
- Home sync out of scope unless explicitly requested.

### 05: Apply the smallest reversible edit

This step's edit is provisional/staged pending Step 06's delegation-and-acceptance review; parent retains authority over the final mutation until that review completes.

Use Codex's native scope: `.agents/skills/` for repository skills, `AGENTS.md` for repository guidance, and `.codex/config.toml` for project runtime settings. Use custom agent-config paths only when active Codex contract and user request require them. Never infer that source repository is present from installed cache layout.

### 06: Propagate references

For behavior changes, update relevant descriptions, mappings, routing text, calibration notes in same patch. List intentionally stale references in `<run-directory>/unresolved-references.md`.

For broad changes with separable config, docs, calibration, or verification workstreams, route through `delegation-lead` and shared specialist orchestration. Use lowest-cost capable canonical role per bounded workstream. Accept delegated change only after handover gate proves ownership, objective evidence, applicable checks, visible unresolved limits, and parent-owned final acceptance.

### 07: Run shared quality gates

Inspect `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/run_gates.py --help`. Supply real affected-surface commands and explicit reasons for every inapplicable gate; never use `true` as skip reason. Review includes clean diff check.

### 08: Write mandatory result artifact

Manage artifacts include `ownership.md`; follow `../../shared/helper-cli-contract.md`. Write with `MANAGE_METADATA`, validate as `manage`, promote only validated candidate.

## Fail-Fast Rules

1. Missing intent or target => fail.
2. Delete/rename with unresolved references => fail.
3. Permission/config change without rationale => fail.
4. Behavior change without routing/docs/calibration decision => fail.
5. Result artifact missing => fail.
6. Target resolves inside installed plugin root => fail without editing.
7. Target is generated `codex-rig-*.toml` role link => fail and route to the bundled `agent-shims` workflow.
8. Existing history would be rewritten without explicit request for that exact operation => fail.

## Quality Gates

Required:

- `review`: inventory diff, reference scan, `git diff --check`.
- `artifact`: `ownership.md`, gate logs, result JSON pass shared validator.

Conditional:

- `lint`/`format`: when generated Python, TOML, shell, or Markdown formatters available.
- `tests`: calibration or smoke checks for changed skills/agents when behavior changes.

## Calibration Hooks

Behavior-changing management edits update or explicitly review owning project's configuration, tests, documentation, routing, and calibration fixtures. Codex Rig maintainers use `PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/calibration/` and `PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/native-skill-contract.md`; installed plugin cache remains immutable.

Calibration must reject premature portable read-only runtime opt-in, generic write authorization, mutable or unjoined scan packs, delegated management mutations, and quality-gate parallelism without executable resource-isolation evidence.

For versioned calibration artifact changes, calculate version from last commit, not dirty worktree. If `HEAD` has `1.3`, all next-commit uncommitted edits stay `1.3` or `1.4`: one version step only; do not bump to `1.5`, `1.6`, etc. before commit.

Commit-output management also keeps owning project's commit-response contract aligned with required message shape. In AI-Rig, canonical packaged contract is `../../shared/commit-response-template.md`:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <title>

Changes:
- <complete meaningful change description>

Impact:
- <concrete effect>

Verification:
- <exact check and result>

Residual limits:
- <remaining limit or "None known">

---

Co-authored-by: Codex <codex@openai.com>
```

Keep `Verification:` change-specific and compact: include only final checks that materially validate the committed surfaces, consolidate related gates, and omit exploratory probes, failure-first reproductions, repeated reruns, setup diagnostics, and unrelated broad checks. The canonical contract is authoritative for the full exclusion and not-run rules.

## Output Contract

Before writing result candidate, follow `../../shared/final-handoff-contract.md`: render and bind `final-handoff.json`, `final.md`, and `final-handoff.validation.json`; after both validators and promotion pass, emit `final.md` verbatim.

Use `../../shared/quality-gates.md`.

### Final chat

Final chat follows shared ordered frame. `Outcome` is completed, rejected, or blocked management action. `Results` has one changed or evaluated surface per row and exactly `Surface | Outcome | Verification | Remaining limit`. Apply shared `Verification`, `Remaining`, `Next steps`, `Confidence`, and supplemental `Artifact` rules; include ownership/policy checks and every required human action with owner.

Minimum artifact payload template: `result-template.json`.
