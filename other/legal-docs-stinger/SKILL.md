## The attorney-review invariant

Every output from this stinger is a **best-effort starting point**, not a compliance certification. The canonical closing line for all outputs is:

> "This is a generated draft for reference. Have a qualified attorney licensed in your jurisdiction review all legal documents before publishing or countersigning."

No exceptions. Including this line is a critical directive for `legal-docs-wasp-drone`.

## Refresh triggers

Re-run scripture-historian at `shallow` tier when any of the following occur:

- New EU SCCs version published by the European Commission
- CCPA/CPRA implementing regulations amended
- Quebec Law 25 enforcement action or new CAI guidance
- LGPD (ANPD) material enforcement action or new guidance
- New IAB TCF major version
- EU-US DPF adequacy decision challenged or revoked (Schrems III risk)
- A new data category or sub-processor added to the product (partial refresh)
- Termly or Iubenda pricing / jurisdiction-coverage changes materially
