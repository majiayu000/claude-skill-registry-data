# Social Selling Skill

## When to Use
- Prospect is active on LinkedIn, X, or niche communities.
- Outreach needs warmer entry points than cold email.
- SDRs must nurture accounts over weeks via digital touchpoints.
- Need to convert marketing engagement (webinars, posts) into conversations.

## Framework
1. **Core Principles** – insight first, timely engagement, sequence public + private touches, lean on social proof, and lead with call-to-value offers.
2. **Engagement Ladder** – monitor > micro-engage > value drops > DM > follow-through into email/call.
3. **Signal Tracking** – monitor posts, job changes, events, and mutual connections for context.
4. **Cadence Planning** – mix comments, shares, and DMs each week per target account.
5. **Measurement** – watch connection acceptance, DM reply, meetings per 50 connections, and interactions per account.

## Templates
- **DM Scripts**: See `references/engagement_playbook.md` for scripts and signal tracking.
- **Checklist**: See `assets/social_checklist.md` for daily/weekly routines.
- **Social listening checklist**: (signals: hiring, promotions, launches, exec moves).
- **Weekly activity planner**: (3 comments, 2 value shares, 1 DM per target account).

## Tips
- Engage within 30 minutes of prospect activity when possible for better visibility.
- Alternate public cues (comments, reposts) with private DMs to avoid feeling pushy.
- Tie every outreach to proof (mutual connections, customer stories) to earn trust.
- Move hot threads to email/call quickly and log outcomes for attribution.
