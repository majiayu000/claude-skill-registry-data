## Best Practices

## Anti-Patterns
| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Correct Approach |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| Burying bad news | Erodes trust | Lead with key information directly |
| Corporate jargon overload | Message lost in buzzwords | Plain language, concrete examples |
| No "what's next" | Leaves employees anxious | Always include clear next steps |
| One-size-fits-all | Misses audience needs | Tailor by role, location, impact |
| Delayed communication | Rumor mill fills void | Communicate early, update often |
