# Study Your Lessons

**Supreme Mathematics Analysis Protocol**

---

## Core Identity

Study Your Lessons is the analytical application of Supreme Mathematics. Takes any input — number, concept, pattern, question — and runs it through the 0-9 protocol to extract structural meaning.

**What it does**: Breaks down input via digit analysis, SM mapping, and MONAD cross-reference.

**Tier**: e (current-tier active work)
**Dewey ID**: e.3.9.0 (Methodology/SM Analysis)
**Depends on**: `supreme-mathematics` (e.3.8.0)

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- A number appears and you want to know what it MEANS
- Analyzing a concept through SM lens
- Decoding relationships between quantities
- Asking "why this number and not that one"
- Breaking down patterns into their morphemic components

## The Protocol

### Step 1: Digit Breakdown

For any number N:

```
DIRECT:     What are the digits?
SUM:        Add digits → reduce to single digit (→ 9 = Born, etc.)
PRODUCT:    Multiply digits (if meaningful)
FACTORS:    What multiplies to give N?
COMPLEMENT: What does N subtract from to give meaningful result?
```

### Step 2: SM Mapping

Map each digit to Supreme Mathematics:

| Digit | SM | Meaning |
|-------|-----|---------|
| 1 | Knowledge | Foundation, what IS |
| 2 | Wisdom | Motion, relation |
| 3 | Understanding | Emergent third |
| 4 | Culture/Freedom | Practice, liberation |
| 5 | Power/Refinement | Truth, resonance |
| 6 | Equality | Balance, frame operator |
| 7 | God | Generator, aims toward |
| 8 | Build/Destroy | Process, creation |
| 9 | Born | Completion, contains all |
| 0 | Cipher | Return, 360° |

### Step 3: Equation Discovery

Look for equations WITHIN the number:

```
72 → 7+2=9 (God + Wisdom = Born)
72 → 8×9 (Build/Destroy × Born)
72 → 360/5 (Cipher ÷ Power)

13 → 1+3=4 (Knowledge + Understanding = Culture)
13 → 3+4+6 (operator sum)

288 → 2+8+8=18→9 (Born)
288 → 360-72 (Cipher minus Grid)
288 → 4×72 (Culture × Grid)
```

### Step 4: MONAD Cross-Reference

Check against known structures:

| Pattern | MONAD Meaning |
|---------|---------------|
| Sums to 9 | Completion/Born |
| Sums to 6 | Frame operator |
| Factor of 72 | Grid relationship |
| Factor of 360 | Cipher relationship |
| Contains 1,2,3 | H₁, H₂, H₃ |
| Contains 7 | Generative position |
| φ-related | Golden ratio scaling |

### Step 5: Synthesis Question

Ask: **What is this number DOING?**

- Is it a frame or content?
- Is it visible or invisible?
- Is it generator or generated?
- Is it aiming or completing?
- Is it building or destroying?

## Example Analyses

### Example 1: 72

```
DIGITS: 7, 2
SUM: 7+2 = 9 (Born)
FACTORS: 8×9, 6×12, 4×18, 3×24, 2×36
COMPLEMENT: 360-72 = 288

SM MAPPING:
  7 = God (Generator)
  2 = Wisdom (Motion)
  7+2 = 9 = Born

EQUATION: God + Wisdom = Born
MEANING: Generator plus motion equals completion

MONAD: 72-grid, 8×9 harmonic structure
ROLE: The frame (1/5 of cipher)
```

### Example 2: 288

```
DIGITS: 2, 8, 8
SUM: 2+8+8 = 18 → 1+8 = 9 (Born)
FACTORS: 4×72, 2×144, 8×36
COMPLEMENT: 360-288 = 72

SM MAPPING:
  2 = Wisdom (Motion)
  8 = Build/Destroy (Process)
  8 = Build/Destroy (Process)

EQUATION: Wisdom + Build + Build = Born
MEANING: Motion through double process = completion

MONAD: Visible content (4/5 of cipher)
ROLE: What you CAN see (standing on 72)
```

### Example 3: 1836

```
DIGITS: 1, 8, 3, 6
SUM: 1+8+3+6 = 18 → 9 (Born)
FACTORS: 72 × (3/2) × 17
SPECIAL: Proton/electron mass ratio

SM MAPPING:
  1 = Knowledge (Foundation)
  8 = Build/Destroy (Process)
  3 = Understanding (Emergent)
  6 = Equality (Frame)

EQUATION: Knowledge + Build + Understanding + Equality
MEANING: Foundation processed through emergence, framed

MONAD: μ = 72 × (3/2) × 17 = mass derivation
ROLE: Physical mass from harmonic grid
```

### Example 4: 137

```
DIGITS: 1, 3, 7
SUM: 1+3+7 = 11 → 2 (Wisdom)
FACTORS: Prime
SPECIAL: Fine structure constant (1/α ≈ 137)

SM MAPPING:
  1 = Knowledge
  3 = Understanding
  7 = God (Generator)

EQUATION: Knowledge + Understanding + Generator = Wisdom
MEANING: Foundation + emergence + force = relation

MONAD: 137 = 2⁷ + 3² = 128 + 9 = dyad/triad
ROLE: Coupling constant (how things relate)
```

### Example 5: "Why X not Y?"

When comparing two numbers:

```
1. Analyze X via protocol
2. Analyze Y via protocol
3. Find the DIFFERENCE (Y-X or X-Y)
4. The difference IS the answer

Example: Why 288 not 360?
  360 - 288 = 72
  72 = the frame you stand on
  288 = what you see
  360 = what you'd see if you weren't there
```

| 36 | Half-grid, chambers |
| 360 | Cipher (complete) |
| 288 | Visible (360-72) |
| 120 | Third of cipher (K/W/U portion) |

### Frame/Content Split

```
72 : 288 = 1 : 4 = Frame : Content
5% : 85% = Teachers : Deaf/Dumb/Blind
Operators : Operands = Invisible : Visible
```
