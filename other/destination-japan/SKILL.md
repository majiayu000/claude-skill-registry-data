# Destination Japan

## Overview

This skill provides Japan-specific knowledge for travel planning, including cultural customs, transportation systems, regional foods, and practical tips.

## Usage

All sub-agents reference this skill when:
- Researching Japan-specific accommodations (ryokans, capsule hotels)
- Planning JR Pass usage and train travel
- Recommending culturally appropriate activities
- Advising on etiquette and customs

## Key Considerations

### Transportation
- JR Pass: Cost-effective for 7+ day trips with multiple cities
- IC Cards (Suica/Pasmo): Essential for local transit
- Shinkansen: Reserve seats during peak seasons

### Accommodations
- Ryokans: Traditional inns with futons, communal baths
- Business hotels: Compact but efficient, good locations
- Note: Many places have strict check-in times

### Cultural Tips
- Tipping: Not customary, can be considered rude
- Shoes: Remove before entering homes, some restaurants, temples
- Cash: Still king in many places despite modernization
- Quiet: Public transit is silent, speaking quietly is expected
