# Creative Production Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- Planning asset production across multiple channels or regions.
- Coordinating internal + external resources (agencies, freelancers, localization vendors).
- Tracking throughput, timelines, and blockers for GTM leadership.

## Framework
1. **Asset Breakdown** – detail deliverables, formats, specs, and reuse opportunities.
2. **Workstream Mapping** – define design, copy, motion, dev, QA, localization workstreams.
3. **Timeline + SLA** – set draft/review/polish milestones with buffer times.
4. **Resource Plan** – assign talent, tools, budgets, and approval layers.
5. **Reporting Hooks** – embed status dashboards, capacity metrics, and risk alerts.

## Templates
- Workback schedule (table + Gantt view).
- Project board column definitions + label taxonomy.
- Weekly status brief template.

## Tips
- Group similar assets to accelerate production via modular components.
- Include review gates with clear exit criteria to avoid churn.
- Pair with `creative-qa-checklist` before green-lighting delivery.
