# Plot Consistency Checker

This skill systematically analyzes story plots to identify inconsistencies, timeline errors, and logical gaps that could disrupt narrative coherence.

## Consistency Areas to Check

### 1. Plot Inconsistencies
- **Timeline errors**: Verify dates, ages, and sequence of events align properly
- **Character knowledge**: Track what each character knows and when they learned it
- **Location continuity**: Ensure settings are consistent across scenes
- **Object/detail consistency**: Verify physical items, descriptions, and details remain accurate

### 2. Character Consistency
- **Behavior matches personality**: Character actions should align with established traits
- **Motivation alignment**: Decisions should match stated goals and internal drives
- **Skill level consistency**: Abilities and knowledge should remain consistent
- **Physical description consistency**: Appearance, mannerisms, and physical traits should be uniform

### 3. Story Logic
- **Cause and effect relationships**: Verify that plot events have logical connections
- **Problem resolution believability**: Solutions should be consistent with story rules
- **Setup and payoff tracking**: Ensure all set-up elements receive proper resolution
- **Foreshadowing implementation**: Check that hints and clues are properly followed through

## Consistency Report Format

When analyzing a story, create reports that include:

### Issues Found
- **List of inconsistencies** with specific details
- **Severity level**:
  - Critical: Breaks story logic or creates major confusion
  - Moderate: Noticeable but doesn't break the story
  - Minor: Small details that observant readers might notice

### Suggested Fixes
- **Practical solutions** for each identified issue
- **Alternative approaches** when multiple fixes are possible
- **Implementation notes** for maintaining story flow while fixing issues

### Chapter References
- **Specific locations** where issues occur
- **Context information** to understand the full scope of the problem
- **Related elements** that might be affected by the fix

## Recurring Elements Tracker

Monitor and document:
- **Character appearances**: Track where each character appears and what they're doing
- **Location visits**: Document when and how locations are used throughout the story
- **Key objects/artifacts**: Follow important items as they move through the narrative
- **Important events**: Record major story beats and their consequences

## Story Bible/Tracker Maintenance

Create and maintain a comprehensive reference document that includes:
- **Character profiles** with detailed information that must remain consistent
- **Timeline chronology** of all story events
- **World-building details** including rules, locations, and cultural elements
- **Plot thread tracking** showing how different storylines develop and resolve
- **Continuity notes** highlighting potential problem areas for future reference

## Analysis Process

1. **Read through the provided text** to understand the current story state
2. **Compare against existing established facts** from earlier chapters or story bible
3. **Identify any inconsistencies** using the categories above
4. **Assess severity** of each identified issue
5. **Provide specific suggestions** for resolving issues
6. **Update the story bible/tracker** with new information while maintaining consistency
7. **Flag potential future conflicts** that may arise from current choices
