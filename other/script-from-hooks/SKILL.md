# Script From Hooks

Build modular ad scripts from winning hooks.

## Process

### Step 1: Analyze Winning Hooks

For each hook: psychological trigger used, expectation set, emotional state created, promise implied.

### Step 2: Select Body Framework

**TESTIMONIAL BODY**
- Real customer story, specific results
- Before → struggle → discovery → result

**EXPLAINER BODY**
- Problem identification
- Why other solutions fail
- Unique mechanism explanation

**SOCIAL PROOF BODY**
- Multiple testimonials
- Results compilation
- Authority endorsements

**DEMONSTRATION BODY**
- Product in action
- Visual proof of claims
- Side-by-side comparison

**LISTICLE BODY**
- 3-5 benefits/reasons
- Build to strongest point

### Step 3: Add B-Roll Suggestions

For each section: visuals needed, stock footage keywords, AI generation prompts, product shots, UGC clips.

### Step 4: Create CTA Variants

**Direct**: "Click the link below" / "Tap to learn more"
**Scarcity**: "Sale ends Friday 6PM Eastern" / "Only X left"
**Story-Based**: Mini testimonial leading to action
**Risk Reversal**: Money-back guarantee, free trial

### Step 5: Output Modular Scripts

```
## SCRIPT: [Name]
Hook: "[Original hook]" | Length: [15s/30s/60s/90s]

### HOOK (0:00-0:03)
**VO:** [Script]
**Visual:** [What viewer sees]
**B-Roll:** [Footage needed]

### BODY 1 (0:03-0:15)
**VO:** [Script]
**Visual:** [What viewer sees]
**B-Roll:** [Footage needed]

### BODY 2 (0:15-0:25)
**VO:** [Script]
**Visual:** [What viewer sees]

### CTA (0:25-0:30)
**VO:** [Script]
**Visual:** [What viewer sees]
**Text Overlay:** [On-screen text]

### EDITING NOTES
- Pacing: [Fast/medium/slow]
- Music: [Style]
- Transitions: [Cut types]

### VARIATION OPTIONS
- Alt Hook: [Alternative]
- Alt CTA: [Alternative]
```

## Key Frameworks

**Trojan Horse (LeadsIcon)**
1. Hook with attention (not product)
2. Build belief through story/proof
3. Product reveal comes LAST
4. CTA is reminder, not hard sell

**Problem-Mechanism-Proof**
1. Agitate problem (hook)
2. Explain unique mechanism
3. Provide proof/testimonials
4. Clear call to action

## Authenticity Rules (LeadsIcon)
- Never script reactions - capture real ones
- Polish kills performance
- Shot on phone > shot on camera
- If it looks like an ad, it fails
