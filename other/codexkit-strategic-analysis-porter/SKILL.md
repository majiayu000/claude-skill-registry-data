# Strategic Analysis (Porter + PESTEL + SWOT)

## When to Use

- During annual strategic planning cycles
- When evaluating entry into a new market or segment
- When competitive dynamics shift significantly
- When preparing strategic recommendations for the board

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Porter's Five Forces

Rate each force (1 = Low, 5 = High):

| Force | Guiding Questions |
|-------|------------------|
| **Threat of New Entrants** | Barriers to entry? Capital requirements? Regulatory hurdles? |
| **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** | Supplier concentration? Switching costs? Unique inputs? |
| **Bargaining Power of Buyers** | Buyer concentration? Price sensitivity? Switching costs? |
| **Threat of Substitutes** | Alternative solutions? Performance ratio? Switching ease? |
| **Competitive Rivalry** | Number of competitors? Industry growth? Exit barriers? |

Overall industry attractiveness: Average of 5 forces (inverted — lower score = more attractive).

### Step 2 — PESTEL Scan

| Factor | Key Trends | Impact (H/M/L) | Timeframe |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **P**olitical | Regulation, trade policy, political stability | | |
| **E**conomic | GDP growth, inflation, exchange rates, interest rates | | |
| **S**ocial | Demographics, consumer behavior, workforce trends | | |
| **T**echnological | Innovation pace, automation, digital disruption | | |
| **E**nvironmental | Sustainability pressure, resource scarcity, climate | | |
| **L**egal | Compliance requirements, IP law, labor law | | |

### Step 3 — SWOT Synthesis

Combine Five Forces (external) + PESTEL (macro) + internal assessment:

| | **Helpful** | **Harmful** |
|---|---|---|
| **Internal** | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| **External** | Opportunities | Threats |

### Step 4 — Strategic Options

Generate strategic options by crossing:
- Strengths × Opportunities → Offensive strategies
- Strengths × Threats → Defensive strategies
- Weaknesses × Opportunities → Reorientation strategies
- Weaknesses × Threats → Survival strategies

Rank options by: Feasibility × Impact × Alignment with vision.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Format |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Industry/market context | Yes | Description or brief |
| Company position | Yes | Products, market share, capabilities |

## Strategic Analysis — [Company/Market]

### Five Forces Assessment

| Force | Rating | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| New Entrants | 2/5 | High capital requirements, regulatory barriers |
| Supplier Power | 3/5 | Moderate concentration, some switching costs |
| Buyer Power | 4/5 | Price-sensitive market, low switching costs |
| Substitutes | 3/5 | Digital alternatives emerging |
| Rivalry | 4/5 | 5 major competitors, slow growth |
| **Industry Attractiveness** | **Moderate** (avg 3.2/5) | |

### PESTEL Summary
[Top 3–5 macro trends with impact assessment]

### SWOT Matrix
| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| Strong brand | Limited digital capability |
| | |
| **Opportunities** | **Threats** |
| Emerging market expansion | New digital entrant |

### Strategic Options (Ranked)

| # | Strategy | Type | Feasibility | Impact | Rank |
|---|----------|------|-------------|--------|------|
| 1 | Digital transformation | Reorientation | High | High | ⭐ 1 |
| 2 | Market expansion APAC | Offensive | Medium | High | 2 |
| 3 | Cost leadership program | Defensive | High | Medium | 3 |

### Recommendation
[2–3 sentence strategic recommendation with rationale]
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Five Forces rated with rationale
- [ ] PESTEL scan with top trends identified
- [ ] SWOT matrix completed
- [ ] Strategic options generated from SWOT cross-analysis
- [ ] Options ranked by feasibility × impact
- [ ] Clear recommendation provided

## Examples

### Prompt

```text
Analyze the competitive landscape for our B2B SaaS company in the HR tech market.
We have 5% market share, strong product but weak sales team.
Key competitors: Workday, BambooHR, Deel.
Use Porter's Five Forces + PESTEL + SWOT and recommend strategic options.
```

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] All claims reference specific frameworks, standards, or quantifiable data
- [ ] Content matches the stated audience's expertise level
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable — each includes a concrete next step
- [ ] No unsupported assertions or generic filler language

## Verification (4C)

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Do referenced frameworks and standards match their official definitions? |
| **Completeness** | Are all key concepts covered without significant gaps for the stated audience? |
| **Context-fit** | Would this be useful for someone new to this domain, or is it too advanced/too basic? |
| **Consequence** | If a stakeholder acted on this immediately, what could they misinterpret? |

## Edge Cases

- **Conflicting frameworks** — State which framework takes precedence and why. Document the trade-off explicitly.
- **Rapidly changing domain** — Note information currency date. Flag sections likely to need updates.
- **Audience has mixed expertise levels** — Provide a glossary and mark advanced sections as optional.
