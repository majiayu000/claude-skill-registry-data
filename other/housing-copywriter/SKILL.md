# Copywriting Guardrails

This skill prevents AI-sounding copy and produces authentic, human writing.

## Core Principles

### 1. Specificity Over Generality
- Replace abstract claims with concrete details
- Use real numbers, names, and examples
- "Increases productivity" → "Saves 3 hours per week on invoicing"

### 2. Cut Ruthlessly
- Delete filler words and throat-clearing
- One strong sentence beats three weak ones
- If a word adds nothing, remove it

### 3. Write Like You Talk
- Read it aloud—if it sounds stiff, rewrite it
- Contractions are fine. Sentence fragments too.
- Vary sentence length. Short punches. Then a longer one to change the rhythm.

### 4. Show, Don't Announce
- Don't say "We're excited to announce"—just announce it
- Don't say "It's important to note"—just note it
- Don't describe what you're doing; do it

### 5. Earn Every Adjective
- Strip all adjectives, then add back only the essential ones
- "Our innovative, cutting-edge, revolutionary platform" → "Our platform"
- Let nouns and verbs do the work

## Before Delivering Copy

Self-check:
1. Did I use any words from the avoid list? → Check `references/avoid-list.md`
2. Could a reader guess this was AI-written? What gives it away?
3. Is there a single weak sentence I'm protecting? Cut it.
4. Read the first sentence—would I keep reading?

## Tone Calibration

Match the context:
- **Casual/social**: Write like texting a smart friend
- **Professional/B2B**: Clear and direct, not corporate-speak
- **Luxury/premium**: Confident and understated, not breathless
- **Startup/tech**: Energetic but not try-hard

When unsure, err toward conversational and direct.

## Pro-Housing Messaging

When writing housing advocacy, zoning reform, or parking flexibility content, follow these additional guidelines. See `references/pro-housing-messaging.md` for complete frameworks, terminology tables, and top-performing message examples.

### Housing Content Structure (5 steps)
1. Start with COSTS—the universal entry point
2. Use COMPETITION to explain why (bidding wars, wait lists, being outbid)
3. Focus on PEOPLE affected (teachers, childcare workers, seniors, young families)
4. Present SPECIFIC, CONCRETE changes (duplexes, townhomes—not jargon)
5. Paint the BENEFIT for people and communities

### Parking Content Structure (3 steps)
1. Define the PROBLEM: Wasteful mandates and their costs
2. Illustrate the SOLUTION: What we gain (homes, businesses, Main Streets)
3. Offer clear ACTION: Parking flexibility

### Critical Terminology Rules
- Say "homes" not "units"
- Say "housing shortage" not "housing crisis"
- Say "allow parking flexibility" not "eliminate parking mandates"
- Say "local homebuilders and property owners" not "developers"
- Say "displacement" not "gentrification"
- Avoid: density, infill, upzone, walkability, missing middle, car dependence

### What NOT to Lead With
- Don't lead with driving less or switching to transit (triggers defensiveness)
- Don't lead with global climate arguments (use local environmental impacts instead)
- Don't use abstractions like "supply and demand" (use competition instead)
- Don't debate how much parking is "right" (emphasize flexibility)
