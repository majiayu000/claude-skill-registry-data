**Hook formulas:**

| Type              | Formula                                              | Example                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Problem-agitate   | "If you're struggling with X, you're not alone..."   | "If your videos get zero views, you're not alone..."       |
| Bold claim        | "This one thing changed everything about X"          | "This one plugin saved me 10 hours a week"                 |
| Curiosity         | "Most people do X wrong, here's why..."              | "Most developers write CSS wrong, here's why..."           |
| Result tease      | "By the end of this video, you'll be able to..."     | "By the end, you'll deploy apps in under 5 minutes"        |
| Pattern interrupt | Start with unexpected visual or statement            | [Show failed result first] "This was my code yesterday..." |
| Story             | "Last week, I made a huge mistake..."                | "Last week, I accidentally deleted production..."          |
| Question          | "Have you ever wondered why X happens?"              | "Have you ever wondered why your site is slow?"            |
| Statistic         | "X% of people fail at Y. Here's how to be different" | "90% of startups fail. Here's how to survive"              |

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Open loops             | "I'll show you the secret trick in a moment..."                    |
| Pattern interrupts     | Change visuals, music, or energy every 30-60 sec                   |
| Tease upcoming content | "Coming up, we'll cover the one thing most people miss..."         |
| Chapter markers        | Add timestamps for easy navigation                                 |

| Direct address         | "Now you might be thinking..." / "I know what you're wondering..." |

### Step 8: Timestamps Template

```markdown
## TIMESTAMPS

0:00 - Hook
0:30 - [Chapter 1]
2:00 - [Chapter 2]
5:00 - [Chapter 3]
8:00 - [Chapter 4]
10:00 - Recap
11:00 - What to watch next
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## Video Script: [Title]

**Type:** [Tutorial/Listicle/Explainer/etc.]
**Length:** [X] minutes
**Target audience:** [Who this is for]

---

### Timestamps

[Formatted timestamp list]

---

### Full Script

[Complete script with all sections, B-roll notes, and on-screen text]

---

### Thumbnail Ideas

1. [Thumbnail concept 1]
2. [Thumbnail concept 2]

### Title Variants

1. [Title option 1]
2. [Title option 2]

### Description

[Video description with timestamps and links]
```

## Validation

Before completing:

- [ ] Hook is under 30 seconds
- [ ] Clear value proposition in first minute
- [ ] B-roll notes included for key sections
- [ ] Transitions between segments are smooth
- [ ] At least one mid-roll CTA
- [ ] Strong end CTA with next video suggestion
- [ ] Timestamps provided
- [ ] Script reads naturally when spoken aloud

## Error Handling

- **No clear topic**: Ask for the specific video subject and target audience.
- **Too long/short**: Adjust depth per section; tutorials need 8-15 min, shorts under 60 sec.
- **Monotone energy**: Add pattern interrupts, questions, and visual change notes.
- **No retention hooks**: Add open loops and "coming up" teases every 2-3 minutes.
- **Missing visuals**: Every 30 seconds should have B-roll or on-screen text note.
