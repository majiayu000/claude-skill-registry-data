# Creative Learnings

Document and systematize learnings from creative tests.

## Process

### Step 1: Analyze Recent Test Results

**Gather Test Data:**
- All creatives tested in period
- Performance metrics (CPA, CTR, CVR)
- Spend and volume
- Test duration

**Categorize Results:**
- Clear winners (scale)
- Promising (iterate)
- Clear losers (kill)
- Inconclusive (retest)

### Step 2: Extract Patterns

**What Worked - Analyze:**
- Common elements in winners
- Hook types performing
- Body structures winning
- CTA formats converting
- Visual styles succeeding
- Avatar responses

**What Didn't Work - Analyze:**
- Common failure points
- Hook types failing
- Angles not resonating
- Visual styles flopping
- Audiences not responding

### Step 3: Update Performance Database

**Angle Tracker:**
| Angle | Tests | Wins | Win Rate | Best CPA | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|----------|----------|-------|
| [Angle 1] | X | X | X% | $X | [Learning] |

**Hook Type Tracker:**
| Hook Type | Tests | Wins | Win Rate | Notes |
|-----------|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Greed | X | X | X% | [Learning] |
| Emotion | X | X | X% | [Learning] |

**Framework Tracker:**
| Framework | Tests | Wins | Win Rate | Notes |
|-----------|-------|------|----------|-------|

### Step 4: Identify New Hypotheses

**From Winners:**
- What can we double down on?
- What variations should we test?
- What audiences should we expand to?

**From Losers:**
- What should we stop doing?
- What assumptions were wrong?
- What variables need isolation?

**From Market:**
- What competitors are doing?
- What trends are emerging?
- What gaps exist?

### Step 5: Output Learnings Document
