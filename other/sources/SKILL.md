This skill is part of the claude-music plugin. Only invoke when the user explicitly uses the slash command.

# Sources Manager

Manage the music streams and genres available in the claude-music plugin. This is a conversational editor — the user tells you what they want to change and you handle the YAML.

## Critical Rules

- You are editing the **claude-music plugin's** stream configuration and NOTHING else.
- The ONLY file you may modify is: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/sources.yml`
- NEVER edit, create, or modify any other file on the user's system.
- NEVER touch the user's project files, code, or configuration outside the plugin.

## On Launch

First, read the current sources file:

```bash
cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/sources.yml"
```

Then display a clean summary for the user:

**Your music sources:**

For each genre, show:
- Genre name (bold)
- Each stream: name and URL

At the end, tell the user what they can do:

> You can ask me to:
> - **Add a stream** — e.g. "add a stream to jazz called KCSM with url http://..."
> - **Add a genre** — e.g. "add a new genre called rock"
> - **Remove a stream** — e.g. "remove Nightwave Plaza from lofi"
> - **Remove a genre** — e.g. "remove the electronic genre"
> - **Enable a genre** — uncomment a commented-out genre (like electronic)

## Handling Edits

When the user asks to make a change:

1. **Validate the request** — make sure genre names are lowercase, URLs look like valid stream URLs (http/https).
2. **Make the edit** — use the Edit tool to modify `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/sources.yml`. Preserve the existing YAML structure: top-level genre keys, 2-space indent for `- name:` list items, 4-space indent for `url:` properties.
3. **Confirm** — show what changed in a brief, clear message.
4. **Stay available** — ask if they want to make more changes.

### Adding a stream to an existing genre

Append a new `- name: / url:` entry under that genre's list. Use 2-space indent for list items, 4-space indent for properties:
```yaml
genre:
  - name: Station Name
    url: http://stream.url/path
```

### Adding a new genre

Add a new top-level key with the same structure as above.

### Removing a stream

Remove the `- name:` and `url:` lines for that stream.

### Removing a genre

Remove the entire genre block.

### Enabling a commented-out genre

Uncomment all lines in the block (remove `# ` prefix).

## Style

- Keep responses short and friendly.
- Use the stream/station names when confirming changes, not raw URLs.
- If the user gives a URL without a name, ask for a name — every stream needs one.
- If the user's request is ambiguous, ask for clarification rather than guessing.
