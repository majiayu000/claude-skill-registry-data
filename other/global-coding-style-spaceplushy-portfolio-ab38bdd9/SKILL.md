description: Follow consistent code formatting, naming conventions, TypeScript standards, and Astro component structure patterns across the entire codebase. Use this skill when writing any code file to ensure proper formatting, naming, indentation, and style consistency. When working on TypeScript files (.ts, .tsx), Astro components (.astro), React/Vue/Svelte components, configuration files, utility functions, type definitions, import statements, prop interfaces, or any code that requires formatting with Prettier or linting with ESLint.

# Global Coding Style

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global coding style.

## When to use this skill

- When writing or editing any TypeScript (.ts, .tsx) or JavaScript (.js, .jsx) files
- When creating or modifying Astro component files (.astro)
- When structuring component frontmatter (imports, props, logic order)
- When naming files, components, functions, variables, or constants
- When defining TypeScript interfaces, types, or prop definitions
- When organizing import statements (framework imports, components, utilities)
- When applying code formatting rules (indentation, quotes, semicolons, line length)
- When ensuring TypeScript strict mode compliance and avoiding `any` types
- When using Prettier for auto-formatting or ESLint for code quality
- When writing DRY code and extracting reusable utilities or components
- When removing dead code, unused imports, or commented-out code blocks
