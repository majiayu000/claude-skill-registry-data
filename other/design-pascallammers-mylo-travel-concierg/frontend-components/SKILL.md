name: Frontend Components
description: Design reusable, composable UI components with single responsibility, clear props interfaces, minimal state management, and proper encapsulation. Use this skill when creating or modifying React components, Vue components, Svelte components, web components, or any modular UI building blocks. Use this when designing component APIs with props and defaults, managing component state, composing smaller components into larger UIs, documenting component usage, implementing component lifecycle methods, or ensuring components are reusable across different contexts. Use this when working on .jsx, .tsx, .vue, .svelte files in component directories like components/, src/components/, or app/components/.

# Frontend Components

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle frontend components.

## When to use this skill:

- When creating or editing component files in directories like components/, src/components/, app/components/
- When building React (.jsx, .tsx), Vue (.vue), Svelte (.svelte), or other framework components
- When designing component props interfaces with clear types and sensible defaults
- When managing component-level state and deciding when to lift state up
- When composing smaller components together to build complex UIs
- When implementing component lifecycle methods (useEffect, onMount, etc.)
- When ensuring components have single responsibility and focused purpose
- When creating reusable components that work across different contexts
- When documenting component usage, props, and providing code examples
- When encapsulating component implementation details and exposing clean APIs
- When refactoring large components into smaller, more manageable pieces
