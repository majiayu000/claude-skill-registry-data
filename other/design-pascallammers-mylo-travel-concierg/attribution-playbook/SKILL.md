# Attribution Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- Standing up or refreshing attribution models across teams.
- Training campaign owners on UTMs, tracking, and governance.
- Running QA before/after changing attribution weights or tooling.

## Framework
1. **Taxonomy Rules** – channel, campaign, creative, and experiment naming standards.
2. **Model Catalog** – when to use first/last/linear/position/data-driven with pros/cons.
3. **Data Contracts** – required fields, systems of record, sync cadence.
4. **QA Checklist** – sample records, dedupe logic, cross-tool reconciliation.
5. **Change Management** – approval workflow, communications, and measurement of impact.

## Templates
- UTM builder + validation sheet.
- Attribution model comparison matrix.
- QA runbook for campaign launches and quarterly audits.

## Tips
- Keep a shared "gotchas" log for recurring tagging errors.
- Align with finance on ROI/CAC definitions before rolling out model changes.
- Pair with `evaluate-attribution-models` for decision-ready narratives.
