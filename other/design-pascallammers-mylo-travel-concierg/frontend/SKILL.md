# Skill: Frontend

Comprehensive frontend development support for the Supaflare web application.

## Routing Logic

Analyze the user's intent and route to the appropriate workflow:

**Component Development** → `workflows/create-component.md`
- "Create a new component for [purpose]"
- "Add a [component_name] component"
- "Build a reusable [component_type]"

**Page Development** → `workflows/create-page.md`
- "Create a new page for [feature]"
- "Add a [page_name] page"
- "Set up routing for [route]"

**API Integration** → `workflows/api-integration.md`
- "Call the [endpoint] API"
- "Fetch data from backend"
- "Add an API call for [feature]"
- "Use the API client"

**Auth & Session** → `workflows/auth.md`
- "Add authentication to [page]"
- "Protect a route"
- "Handle login/logout"
- "Check user session"

**Styling** → `workflows/styling.md`
- "Style the [component]"
- "Add Tailwind classes for [design]"
- "Make [component] responsive"

**Configuration Questions** → `context/config.md`
- "What port is the frontend on?"
- "Where is the Supabase config?"
- "How do I start the dev server?"
