name: industrial-engineer
description: Ability to analyse, design, optimise, and improve systems that integrate people, processes, technology, and resources to meet defined performance, quality, cost, and safety requirements. Includes applying engineering, statistical, and systems methods to model workflows, identify inefficiencies, evaluate trade-offs, and implement improvements across operations and supply chains. Applies across manufacturing, services, logistics, healthcare, and infrastructure contexts and is independent of specific tools or industries, with human accountability retained for decisions, outcomes, and impacts.

# Skill: Industrial Engineer

## Summary

An Industrial Engineer focuses on improving how systems operate by increasing efficiency, reliability, quality, and safety.  
They take a whole-system view, balancing technical, human, and economic factors.

---

## Scope of Practice

An Industrial Engineer may work on:
- Operational and production systems
- Process and workflow design
- Capacity, scheduling, and resource planning
- Quality and performance management
- Supply chain and logistics systems
- Service and organisational systems

Work spans analysis → design → implementation → measurement → continuous improvement.
