# Founder Mode

Help founders run companies using contrarian principles that break conventional management wisdom. This skill provides real examples from successful founders, not generic advice.

## Core Insight

Manager mode "hire good people and give them room" often means "hire professional fakers and let them destroy your company." Founders can do things managers cannot because they have authority, context, and skin in the game that hired executives lack.

## Real Founder Mode Examples

### Skip-Level Engagement

**Steve Jobs at Apple:**
- Held weekly 3-hour meetings with his top 100 people (not just direct reports)
- Personally reviewed every product detail down to icon pixels
- Result: Unprecedented product coherence across all Apple products

**Patrick Collison at Stripe:**
- Still does code reviews on critical infrastructure
- Personally responds to developer complaints on Twitter
- Result: Developer trust that Stripe actually cares about their experience

**Brian Chesky at Airbnb:**
- After 2020 layoffs, went from 7 layers of management to 2
- Now reviews every major design personally
- Result: Faster decisions, clearer product vision

### Contrarian Hiring Decisions

**Tobi Lütke at Shopify:**
- Refused to hire a COO for years despite board pressure
- "A COO would just create a layer between me and the problems"
- Result: Stayed close to merchant pain points during critical growth

**Stewart Butterfield at Slack:**
- Personally interviewed every employee until employee #500
- Conventional wisdom: "That doesn't scale"
- Result: Exceptional early culture that defined the company

### Ignoring "Best Practices"

**Jeff Bezos at Amazon:**
- Banned PowerPoint in favor of 6-page memos
- Conventional wisdom: "Executives don't have time to read"
- Result: Better thinking, clearer communication

**Stripe's API-first decision:**
- Launched with 7 lines of code to integrate vs competitors' 100+ page contracts
- Conventional wisdom: "Enterprise sales needs complexity"
- Result: Dominated developer payments market

## When Founder Mode Beats Manager Mode

| Situation | Manager Mode Says | Founder Mode Does |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Product quality slipping | "Hire a VP of Quality" | Review products yourself, find the root cause |
| Culture diluting | "HR will handle it" | Personally interview key hires, fire culture violators fast |
| Innovation stalling | "Create an innovation lab" | Kill the lab, put innovators on core product |
| Customers complaining | "Hire more support" | Talk to 10 angry customers yourself this week |
| Executives underperforming | "Give them more time, coaching" | Fire fast, you probably already know |

## Red Flags: You're Being Pushed to Manager Mode

1. **"You need to trust your team"** - Translation: Stop paying attention to problems
2. **"That's not scalable"** - Translation: Do less of what made you successful
3. **"Let the process work"** - Translation: Accept mediocrity wrapped in procedure
4. **"You're a bottleneck"** - Translation: Remove yourself from quality control
5. **"Executives need autonomy"** - Translation: Let them build empires

## Founder Mode Tactics

### Weekly Practices

- **10 customer conversations** - Not surveys, real conversations
- **Code/product review** - Touch the actual work, not just dashboards
- **Skip-level 1:1s** - Talk to people 2-3 levels down regularly
- **Kill a meeting** - Every week, eliminate one recurring meeting

### Monthly Practices

- **Work the support queue** - 2 hours handling real tickets
- **Shadow a new hire** - See onboarding through fresh eyes
- **Review every departure** - Exit interviews done by you, not HR
- **Competitor deep-dive** - Use their product yourself

### Quarterly Practices

- **Org chart audit** - Every layer must justify its existence
- **Process purge** - Kill processes that exist "because we've always done it"
- **Direct customer visit** - Go to their office, see how they actually use your product

## Output Structure

When applying founder mode to a challenge:

1. **Situation:** What's the challenge through founder mode lens?
2. **Conventional Trap:** What's the standard advice and why it fails here?
3. **Founder Precedent:** Which successful founder faced similar? What did they do?
4. **Direct Action:** What can you do THIS WEEK without delegation?
5. **Resistance Plan:** Who will push back and how to handle it?
6. **Success Metric:** How will you know it's working?

## When NOT to Use Founder Mode

- Routine operations that genuinely don't need you
- Legal/compliance where expertise matters more than instinct
- Areas where you lack context (use it to GET context, then decide)
- When you're exhausted and need to recharge (founder mode requires energy)
