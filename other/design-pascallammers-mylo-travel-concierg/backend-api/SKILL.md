name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles with resource-based URLs, appropriate HTTP methods, and consistent naming conventions. Use this skill when creating or modifying API route handlers, endpoint definitions, or REST controllers in files like routes.py, api.ts, controllers/, handlers/, or when implementing HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). Also applies when working on API versioning, request/response validation, status code handling, rate limiting, or any backend endpoint logic that serves HTTP requests to frontend clients or external systems.

# Backend API

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying route handlers in files like `routes.py`, `api.ts`, `routes.js`, `app.py`, or `server.ts`
- When working in controller or handler directories like `controllers/`, `handlers/`, `routes/`, or `api/`
- When implementing HTTP method handlers (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for any resource
- When defining RESTful resource endpoints like `/users`, `/products`, `/orders` or nested resources like `/users/:id/posts`
- When adding API versioning strategies (URL-based like `/v1/users` or header-based)
- When implementing query parameter handling for filtering, sorting, pagination, or search functionality
- When setting up rate limiting, request validation, or response formatting middleware
- When working on files that return HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500, etc.) to clients
- When creating backend services that serve JSON responses to frontend applications or mobile apps
- When building public or internal APIs consumed by external systems or microservices
