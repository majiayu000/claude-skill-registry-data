## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
Design end-to-end systems (APIs, services, data stores, observability) with explicit tradeoffs, capacity plans, and risk controls.

### Triggers
- **Positive:** Requests for architecture/design docs, capacity/scale planning, reliability/resiliency improvements, migration blueprints.
- **Negative:** Single-component coding tasks (route to component specialist) or pure prompt rewrites (prompt-architect).

### Guardrails
- Structure-first: ensure `SKILL.md`, `readme`, `examples/`, and `tests/` exist; add missing docs before delivery.
- Constraint extraction: HARD/SOFT/INFERRED (SLOs, scale targets, budgets, compliance, deadlines).
- Validation planning: include load, failure-injection, and rollback testing.
- Explicit confidence with ceiling (inference/report 0.70; research 0.85; observation/definition 0.95).
- Cost/reliability balance: document tradeoffs; no hidden assumptions.

### Execution Phases
1. **Intake & Goals**
   - Capture SLO/SLI targets, traffic models, data constraints, compliance, and timelines.
   - Map dependencies and integration boundaries.
2. **Architecture & Decisions**
   - Propose candidate architectures with tradeoffs; select patterns (CQRS, event-driven, micro/monolith) based on constraints.
   - Define data model, storage choices, caching strategy, and consistency model.
3. **Reliability & Operations**
   - Plan observability (logs/metrics/traces), rollout/rollback, and incident response hooks.
   - Include capacity planning (baseline + surge) and cost guardrails.
4. **Validation Plan**
   - Specify tests: load/perf, chaos/failure-injection, DR/backup restore, schema migration rehearsals.
   - Identify acceptance criteria and exit checks.
5. **Delivery**
   - Produce architecture doc, sequence/data-flow diagrams, runbooks, and phased rollout plan.
   - Recommend owners and next steps; tag MCP memory (`WHO=system-design-architect-{session}`, `WHY=skill-execution`).

### Output Format
- Request summary with constraints (HARD/SOFT/INFERRED).
- Final architecture choice with rationale and tradeoffs.
- Validation plan and rollout/rollback steps.
- Risks, mitigations, and ownership.
- Confidence statement with ceiling.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Constraints captured and confirmed.
- [ ] Tradeoffs documented for chosen architecture.
- [ ] Observability + SLO/SLA mapping defined.
- [ ] Load/failure/rollback tests planned.
- [ ] Confidence ceiling stated.
