name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles with clear resource-based URLs and appropriate HTTP methods. Use this skill when creating or modifying API routes, endpoints, controllers, or API handlers. When working with HTTP request/response handling, API versioning, rate limiting, or status code management. When designing URL structures, query parameters, or nested resource endpoints. When implementing API middleware, authentication endpoints, or any server-side API logic in route files, controller files, or API configuration files.

# Backend API

## When to use this skill

- When creating or editing API route files (e.g., `routes.rb`, `api.py`, `routes.ts`, `*.route.js`)
- When working on API controller files or request handlers

- When implementing HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- When adding API versioning or managing API versions
- When configuring rate limiting or API throttling
- When setting up query parameters for filtering, sorting, or pagination
- When defining nested resource routes
- When implementing API middleware or authentication endpoints
- When managing HTTP status codes and API responses

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.
