# Carousel Copy Skill

Transform research and knowledge base material into compelling carousel slide copy that sounds like an interventional cardiologist—authoritative, clear, evidence-grounded, human.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use when you have:
- Research output (PubMed findings, trial data, clinical guidelines)
- Long-form content (newsletters, articles, scripts) to repurpose
- A topic + knowledge base that needs carousel conversion
- Draft slides that feel "flat" or "generic"

---

## The Core Principle

**You are not writing "social media content." You are a specialist distilling clinical knowledge for intelligent laypeople.**

Every slide should feel like a cardiologist explaining something important to a patient in clinic—direct, clear, evidence-backed, respectful of their intelligence.

---

## Voice Calibration

### The Target Zone

```
TOO CASUAL                    TARGET                         TOO FORMAL
─────────────────────────────────●─────────────────────────────────────
"Yo, statins are                "Statins reduce heart           "HMG-CoA reductase
actually fire for               attacks by 25-30%.              inhibitors demonstrate
your heart lol"                 The evidence is clear."         significant cardiovascular
                                                                risk reduction."
```

### Voice Markers

| Do This | Not This |
|---------|----------|
| "The evidence shows..." | "Studies have shown..." (passive, generic) |
| "In most patients..." | "Generally speaking..." (hedging) |
| "This matters because..." | "It's important to note that..." (AI tell) |
| "The risk drops by 30%" | "There is a significant reduction" (vague) |
| "Here's what I tell my patients" | "One should consider" (distant) |
| "The data is clear" | "Research suggests" (weak) |

### Sentence Rhythm

- Lead with the finding, not the setup
- Short declarative sentences for key points
- Occasional question to the reader (sparingly)
- Never more than 2 sentences of similar length in a row

**Example:**
```
FLAT: Studies have shown that walking can be beneficial for heart health, 
with research indicating improvements in cardiovascular outcomes.

BETTER: Walking 30 minutes daily cuts heart disease risk by 20%. 
You don't need a gym. You need consistency.
```

## Knowledge Base → Slide Copy Transformation

### Step 1: Extract the Core Insight

From your research/knowledge base, identify:
1. **The key finding** (what changed, by how much)
2. **The clinical relevance** (why should the reader care)
3. **The actionable element** (what can they do with this)

### Step 2: Compress Without Losing Meaning

**The 15-Word Discipline**

Each slide body should convey ONE idea in ≤15 words. This forces clarity.

| Research Finding | First Draft (too long) | Final Copy (≤15 words) |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| "SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated a 26% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure" | SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the combined risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization by 26% | SGLT2 inhibitors cut heart failure hospitalization by 26%. One pill, major impact. |
| "Meta-analysis of 19 RCTs showed statin-associated muscle symptoms occur in 5-10% of patients, with most able to continue therapy" | While 5-10% of patients on statins experience muscle symptoms, the majority can continue their therapy | Muscle pain affects 5-10%. Most can continue statins with adjustments. |

### Step 3: Add Clinical Authority

Sprinkle markers that signal "doctor speaking" not "content creator speaking":

**Authority Markers (use 1-2 per carousel):**
- "In my practice, I see this regularly"
- "The clinical reality is..."
- "What the guidelines miss..."
- "Here's what the data actually shows"
- "This is what I tell my patients"
- "After thousands of cases..."

**Evidence Markers (use throughout):**
- Specific numbers: "25%", "HR 0.74", "NNT of 20"
- Trial names: "In PARADIGM-HF...", "The EMPEROR-Reduced trial showed..."
- Timeframes: "Over 3.5 years...", "At 12-month follow-up..."

## Slide Type Copy Patterns

### HOOK Slide (Slide 1)

**Purpose:** Stop the scroll. Create curiosity gap.

**Copy Structure:**
```
[Provocative statement or question]
[Subtext that promises value]
```

**Patterns that work:**
| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Counterintuitive fact | "Your LDL might be normal. Your risk isn't." |
| Specific number + surprise | "67% of heart attacks happen with 'normal' cholesterol" |
| Direct question | "Statins causing muscle pain? Here's what to do." |
| Myth setup | "Everything you've heard about salt is wrong" |
| Patient scenario | "Fit, 45, no symptoms. Triple vessel disease." |

**Avoid:**
- Generic questions: "Want to know about heart health?"
- Clickbait without substance: "Doctors don't want you to know this"
- Fear-only hooks: "You could die from this" (no hope)

### TIPS Slide

**Purpose:** Actionable takeaway.

**Copy Structure:**
```
[Tip headline - 5-8 words]

[Supporting detail - 1 sentence]
```

**Example:**
```
Tip #3: Check LDL, not just total cholesterol

Total cholesterol can hide high LDL. Ask for the breakdown.
```

**Compression technique:** Start with the action verb.
- "Check your...", "Ask for...", "Avoid...", "Choose...", "Monitor..."

### STATS Slide

**Purpose:** Make data memorable.

**Copy Structure:**
```
[BIG NUMBER]
[What it means in plain terms]
[Source - footer or small text]
```

**Example:**
```
26%
Lower risk of heart failure hospitalization

DAPA-HF Trial, NEJM 2019
```

**Where to put the citation:**
- Footer (preferred): Clean slide, source visible but not dominant
- In-body: Only when the source itself is the point ("NEJM just published...")

### MYTH Slide

**Purpose:** Correct misconception with evidence.

**Copy Structure:**
```
MYTH: [State the misconception exactly as people believe it]

TRUTH: [Direct correction + brief evidence]
```

**Example:**
```
MYTH: "Statins cause permanent muscle damage"

TRUTH: Muscle symptoms affect 5-10%. They're reversible. 
Most patients continue therapy successfully.
```

**Key:** State the myth in the reader's own words/beliefs, not a strawman.

### COMPARISON Slide

**Purpose:** Clarify choices or show contrast.

**Copy Structure:**
```
[Option A]          vs          [Option B]
[Key differentiator]            [Key differentiator]
[When to choose]                [When to choose]
```

**Keep parallel:** Same structure on both sides.

### STORY Slide

**Purpose:** Human connection, case illustration.

**Copy Structure:**
```
[Patient descriptor - age, situation]
[What happened]
[Insight or lesson]
```

**Example:**
```
52-year-old executive. Perfect BMI. Non-smoker.
Came in for a routine checkup.

CAC score: 450. Three-vessel disease.

Risk factors don't tell the whole story.
```

**Privacy note:** Keep details generic enough to protect identity while specific enough to feel real.

### STEPS Slide

**Purpose:** Process or sequence.

**Copy Structure:**
```
Step [N]: [Action in 3-5 words]

[One sentence of detail]
```

**Example:**
```
Step 2: Get baseline labs

LDL, kidney function, liver enzymes—before starting therapy.
```

### CTA Slide (Final)

**Purpose:** Clear next action.

**Copy Structure:**
```
[Value reminder - what they learned]

[Specific CTA]
@handle
```

**Example:**
```
Heart health is simpler than you think.

Follow for evidence-based cardiology.
@heartdocshailesh
```

**CTA options:**
- "Follow for more" (growth)
- "Save this for later" (engagement)
- "Share with someone who needs this" (reach)
- "Questions? Comment below" (engagement)

## Archetype Adaptation

Same information, different framing based on who you're writing for.

### Example: SGLT2 Inhibitors Reduce Heart Failure Risk

**For Heart Patients (Archetype 1):**
```
Hook: "On heart failure meds? This one might not be on your list yet."
Body: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce hospitalization by 26%. 
Ask your cardiologist if you're a candidate.
```

**For Biohackers (Archetype 3):**
```
Hook: "SGLT2 inhibitors: Not just for diabetes anymore"
Body: DAPA-HF showed 26% reduction in HF hospitalization 
independent of diabetes status. HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.65-0.85).
Mechanism: sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibition + 
cardiac remodeling effects.
```

**For Lifestyle Disease Group (Archetype 2):**
```
Hook: "Diabetic? Your heart meds might need an upgrade."
Body: SGLT2 inhibitors do double duty—blood sugar AND 
heart protection. 26% fewer hospitalizations in trials.
```

**For Caregivers (Archetype 5):**
```
Hook: "Is your family member on the right heart meds?"
Body: SGLT2 inhibitors are now guideline-recommended for 
heart failure. If they're not on one, ask why at the next visit.
```

### Adaptation Quick Reference

| Archetype | Hook Style | Data Depth | Tone | CTA |
|-----------|------------|------------|------|-----|
| Heart Patients | Direct relevance | Outcome-focused | Reassuring + clear | "Ask your doctor" |
| Lifestyle Disease | Wake-up call | Consequence-focused | Firm but hopeful | "Start here" |
| Biohackers | Novel angle | Deep (HR, CI, mechanism) | Peer-to-peer | "Optimize this" |
| Health Enthusiasts | Myth-buster | Evidence summary | Curious guide | "Share with family" |
| Caregivers | Protective concern | Action-focused | Supportive | "Bring this to appointment" |
| Young & Anxious | Reassurance frame | Context (normal vs. not) | Calm authority | "When to actually worry" |

---

## Citation Placement Rules

**Footer placement (default):**
- Keeps slide clean
- Use for: Trial names, journal references, guideline citations
- Format: `Trial Name, Journal Year` or `Source: ACC/AHA Guidelines 2023`

**In-body placement:**
- When the source is the point of the slide
- When establishing authority for controversial claim
- Format: Integrate naturally: "The PARADIGM-HF trial showed..."

**Skip citation when:**
- Stating clinical common knowledge
- Giving practical advice from experience
- The claim is uncontroversial among cardiologists

---

## Quality Checklist Before Finalizing

- [ ] Hook creates genuine curiosity (not clickbait)
- [ ] Each slide has ONE clear idea
- [ ] Body text ≤15 words per slide
- [ ] At least 2 specific numbers/data points in carousel
- [ ] At least 1 authority marker ("In my practice...", "What I tell patients...")
- [ ] No AI tells ("It's important to note", "In conclusion", "vital role")
- [ ] CTA is specific, not generic
- [ ] Citations placed for clarity, not clutter
- [ ] Reads like a doctor, not a content creator

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Hedging everything | "May potentially help reduce..." | "Reduces risk by 25%" |
| Generic claims | "Heart health is important" | "LDL above 100 doubles your risk" |
| Passive voice | "It has been shown that..." | "Three trials showed..." |
| Missing specificity | "Significant improvement" | "26% reduction in hospitalization" |
| Overexplaining | 3 sentences where 1 works | Cut to the core insight |
| Forgetting the human | All data, no "so what" | Add "This means for you..." |

---

## Positioning Markers

These phrases signal "interventional cardiologist" vs. generic health page:

**Use these (sparingly, 1-2 per carousel):**
- "After thousands of angiograms..."
- "What I see in the cath lab..."
- "The guidelines say X, but clinically..."
- "In my practice..."
- "Before I put in a stent, I always..."
- "Here's what your cardiologist is thinking..."
- "The cardiology community is shifting toward..."

**Avoid these (sounds like influencer):**
- "Listen up..."
- "This is a game-changer..."
- "Doctors hate this..."
- "The truth they don't tell you..."
- "You need to know this..."

---

## Example Transformation

### Input: Knowledge Base Excerpt

```
DAPA-HF Trial Summary:
- Dapagliflozin vs placebo in HFrEF patients (EF ≤40%)
- Primary endpoint: CV death or worsening HF
- Result: HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.65-0.85), p<0.001
- NNT: 21 over median 18.2 months
- Benefit seen regardless of diabetes status
- Most common side effect: Volume depletion (7.5% vs 6.8%)
```

### Output: Carousel Copy

**Slide 1 (HOOK):**
```
A diabetes drug that prevents heart failure
—even if you don't have diabetes

The DAPA-HF story
```

**Slide 2 (STATS):**
```
26%
Reduction in heart failure hospitalization or CV death

HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.65-0.85)
DAPA-HF Trial
```

**Slide 3 (TIPS):**
```
Who benefits?

Heart failure with EF ≤40%
—whether you have diabetes or not.

The effect was consistent across both groups.
```

**Slide 4 (STATS):**
```
NNT: 21

Treat 21 patients for 18 months 
to prevent one major event.

That's a strong number.
```

**Slide 5 (MYTH):**
```
MYTH: "It's a diabetes drug—I don't have diabetes"

TRUTH: Dapagliflozin is now FDA-approved for heart failure 
independent of diabetes. The heart benefits stand alone.
```

**Slide 6 (TIPS):**
```
What to watch for

Volume depletion: dizziness, lightheadedness
Happens in ~7% of patients. Usually manageable.
```

**Slide 7 (CTA):**
```
SGLT2 inhibitors changed how we treat heart failure.

If you have HFrEF and you're not on one, 
ask your cardiologist why.
