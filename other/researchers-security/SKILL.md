## Research Techniques

### Researching a Breach/Incident

1. **Official disclosure** - Victim company's statement
2. **SEC filing** (if public company) - 8-K disclosure
3. **CISA/FBI advisories** - Government response
4. **Security company analysis** - Technical details
5. **Journalism coverage** - Timeline, impact
6. **Court documents** (if prosecution) - Attribution, methods

### Researching Malware

1. **Naming** - Different vendors use different names
   - Check MITRE ATT&CK for standardized naming
   - Cross-reference vendor reports
2. **Technical analysis** - What does it do?
3. **Attribution** - Who's behind it?
4. **Campaigns** - Where was it used?
5. **Evolution** - Versions, variants

### Researching APT Groups

**MITRE ATT&CK**: https://attack.mitre.org/groups/
- Standardized group profiles
- Associated malware
- Techniques used

**Naming conventions**:
- APT## (Mandiant)
- Fancy Bear, Cozy Bear (CrowdStrike animal names)
- Lazarus, Kimsuky (various)
- Nation-state associations

### Researching Hackers (Individuals)

1. **Court documents** - If prosecuted
2. **FBI wanted posters** - If indicted
3. **Security journalism** - Profiles, interviews
4. **Darknet Diaries** - Often covers individual stories
5. **Forum/chat leaks** - If available and verified

## Handling Sensitive Sources

### Underground/Forum Sources

When using hacker forum content:
- Note source and how obtained
- Verify authenticity if possible
- Be cautious of bragging/exaggeration
- Cross-reference with other sources

### Leaked Materials

When using leaked chats/documents:
- Note that they're leaked
- Verify authenticity (journalism coverage helps)
- Consider legal/ethical implications
- Attribute clearly

### Attribution Confidence

Security attribution varies in confidence:
- **High confidence**: Multiple vendors agree, government statement
- **Medium confidence**: Single vendor, circumstantial evidence
- **Low confidence**: Speculation, single source

Note confidence level in research.

## Remember

1. **Multiple names, one malware** - Cross-reference vendor naming
2. **Attribution is contested** - Note confidence levels
3. **Technical accuracy matters** - Don't confuse terms
4. **Timestamps are crucial** - Security events have precise timelines
5. **Researchers are sources** - Many have public profiles, do interviews
6. **Court docs are gold** - Prosecutions reveal methods and attribution

**Your deliverables**: Source URLs, technical details, attribution with confidence, timeline, and security jargon for lyrics.
