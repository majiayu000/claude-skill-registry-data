<core_concepts>

## Red Ocean vs Blue Ocean

| Aspect | Red Ocean | Blue Ocean |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Market Space | Compete in existing market | Create uncontested market |
| Competition | Beat the competition | Make competition irrelevant |
| Demand | Exploit existing demand | Create and capture new demand |
| Value/Cost | Make value-cost trade-off | Break the value-cost trade-off |
| Strategy | Align with differentiation OR low cost | Pursue differentiation AND low cost |

## Value Innovation
The cornerstone of Blue Ocean Strategy:

```
Traditional thinking:  Higher value = Higher cost
                       Lower cost = Lower value

Value Innovation:      Higher value + Lower cost = New market space
```

**How it works:**
- Eliminate and reduce factors the industry competes on
- Raise and create factors the industry has never offered
- Result: Leap in value for buyers AND the company

## The Strategy Canvas

A diagnostic and action framework showing:
- **Horizontal axis:** Factors the industry competes on
- **Vertical axis:** Offering level (low to high)
- **Value curve:** Your company's profile across factors

## The Four Actions Framework (ERRC)

| Action | Question | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Eliminate** | Which factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated? | Remove elements that no longer add value or have become hygiene factors |
| **Reduce** | Which factors should be reduced well below the industry's standard? | Strip away over-designed features that increase cost without adding value |
| **Raise** | Which factors should be raised well above the industry's standard? | Address compromises the industry forces on customers |
| **Create** | Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered? | Discover entirely new sources of value for buyers |

## Six Paths to Blue Oceans

### Path 1: Look Across Alternative Industries
**Question:** What are the alternative industries to your industry?

```
Example: NetJets
- Alternative to commercial airlines AND private jet ownership
- Combined reliability of commercial with flexibility of private
- Created fractional jet ownership industry
```

**Analysis Steps:**
1. List alternatives (not just substitutes)
2. Ask: Why do customers trade across alternatives?
3. Find factors that make customers choose each
4. Combine the best of both

### Path 2: Look Across Strategic Groups
**Question:** What strategic groups exist in your industry?

```
Example: Curves Fitness
- Strategic groups: Upscale gyms vs. home exercise
- Combined: Simple gym experience + affordable + female-only
- Result: New strategic group
```

**Analysis Steps:**
1. Map strategic groups by price and features
2. Identify why customers trade up or down
3. Find factors that trigger movement
4. Combine appeals across groups

### Path 3: Look Across the Chain of Buyers
**Question:** Who are the purchasers, users, and influencers?

| Role | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Purchasers | Pay for product | Corporate IT dept |
| Users | Actually use product | Employees |
| Influencers | Shape buying decision | Analysts, reviewers |

```
Example: Novo Nordisk Insulin
- Industry focused on: Doctors (influencers)
- Novo Nordisk focused on: Patients (users)
- Created: NovoPen (easy self-injection)
```

**Analysis Steps:**
1. Map the buyer chain
2. Identify which group your industry focuses on
3. Shift focus to overlooked group
4. Discover new value factors

### Path 4: Look Across Complementary Products/Services
**Question:** What happens before, during, and after your product is used?

```
Example: Borders Bookstore (original concept)
- Before: Getting to store
- During: Finding books, reading
- After: Getting coffee, discussing
- Created: Coffee shops in bookstores, reading chairs
```

**Analysis Steps:**
1. Map the total solution customers seek
2. Identify pain points in the journey
3. Look at complementary products/services
4. Bundle or integrate solutions

### Path 5: Look Across Functional-Emotional Appeal
**Question:** Is your industry competing on function or emotion?

| Current Appeal | Opportunity |
|----------------|-------------|
| Functional | Add emotional elements |
| Emotional | Strip to functional core |

```
Example: Swatch
- Watch industry: Functional (timekeeping)
- Swatch: Emotional (fashion accessory)
- Transformed watches into statement pieces
```

**Analysis Steps:**
1. Determine industry's current appeal orientation
2. Identify elements reinforcing that appeal
3. Challenge the orientation
4. Add/remove elements to shift appeal

### Path 6: Look Across Time
**Question:** What trends have high probability of impacting your industry?

**Trend Criteria:**
- Decisive to business (will change industry)
- Irreversible (not a fad)
- Clear trajectory (predictable direction)

```
Example: Apple iTunes
- Trend: Digital music distribution
- Industry response: Fighting piracy
- Apple response: Created legal, convenient digital music store
```

**Analysis Steps:**
1. Identify decisive, irreversible trends
2. Assess their impact trajectory
3. Ask: What will the industry look like when trend plays out?
4. Work backward to current opportunity

## Building a Strategy Canvas

### Step 1: Identify Competitive Factors
List factors your industry competes on:
```
Factors typically include:
- Price
- Quality/Performance
- Features/Options
- Service level
- Brand/Status
- Convenience
- Technology
- Network effects
- Industry-specific factors
```

### Step 2: Plot the Industry Average
For each factor, score the industry average (1-5 scale):
```
1 = Very low offering
2 = Below average
3 = Industry average
4 = Above average
5 = Very high offering
```

### Step 3: Plot Key Competitors
Score each major competitor on the same factors.

### Step 4: Plot Your Current Position
Score your company's current offering.

### Step 5: Design Your Blue Ocean Curve
Apply ERRC to create a divergent value curve:
- Eliminate: Factors scored 0
- Reduce: Factors scored 1-2
- Raise: Factors scored 4-5
- Create: New factors not on current canvas

### Strategy Canvas Output Format

```
| Factor        | Industry | Competitor A | Competitor B | Your Blue Ocean |
|---------------|----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Price         | 3        | 4            | 2            | 2 (Reduce)      |
| Quality       | 3        | 4            | 3            | 5 (Raise)       |
| Complexity    | 4        | 5            | 4            | 0 (Eliminate)   |
| Convenience   | 2        | 2            | 3            | 5 (Raise)       |
| Fun Factor    | 1        | 1            | 1            | 4 (Create)      |
| Service       | 3        | 4            | 2            | 3 (Maintain)    |
```

### Three Characteristics of a Good Strategy

1. **Focus** - Don't try to excel at everything
2. **Divergence** - Your curve looks different from competitors
3. **Compelling Tagline** - Can be explained in one clear phrase

## Blue Ocean Index

### Opportunity Score (0-100)
```python
def calculate_blue_ocean_index(analysis):
    # Market attractiveness (30 points)
    market_size = score(1-10) * 1.5  # Max 15
    growth_potential = score(1-10) * 1.5  # Max 15

    # Differentiation potential (30 points)
    eliminate_impact = count_eliminates * 5  # Max 15
    create_impact = count_creates * 5  # Max 15

    # Feasibility (20 points)
    resource_availability = score(1-10) * 1.0  # Max 10
    execution_complexity = (10 - score(1-10)) * 1.0  # Max 10

    # Risk assessment (20 points)
    imitation_barrier = score(1-10) * 1.0  # Max 10
    adoption_likelihood = score(1-10) * 1.0  # Max 10

    return sum([
        market_size, growth_potential,
        eliminate_impact, create_impact,
        resource_availability, execution_complexity,
        imitation_barrier, adoption_likelihood
    ])
```

### Blue Ocean Viability Matrix

| Score Range | Assessment | Recommendation |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 80-100 | Strong Blue Ocean | Prioritize execution |
| 60-79 | Promising | Refine ERRC, validate assumptions |
| 40-59 | Moderate | Re-examine paths, find better angle |
| 0-39 | Weak | Fundamental rethink needed |

### Key Validation Questions

**Before committing:**
1. Does the strategy create a leap in value for buyers?
2. Is the price accessible to the mass of target buyers?
3. Can you attain your cost target while maintaining a profit margin?
4. What are the adoption hurdles? Have you addressed them upfront?

### Three Tiers of Noncustomers

| Tier | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| First Tier | "Soon-to-be" noncustomers on edge of market | Waiting for better alternative |
| Second Tier | "Refusing" noncustomers who consciously chose against | Don't see value in current offerings |
| Third Tier | "Unexplored" noncustomers in distant markets | Never considered the industry |

### Six Paths Analysis

1. **Alternative Industries:** Tax software (TurboTax model), HR platforms
2. **Strategic Groups:** DIY (templates) vs. Full-service (law firms)
3. **Buyer Chain:** Focus on business owners (users) not office managers (purchasers)
4. **Complements:** Banking, accounting, insurance—integrate
5. **Functional-Emotional:** Currently functional → Add emotional (peace of mind)
6. **Trends:** AI/automation, remote work, gig economy growth

### Blue Ocean Index: 82/100

| Component | Score | Max |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Market size | 14 | 15 |
| Growth potential | 13 | 15 |
| Eliminate impact | 12 | 15 |
| Create impact | 15 | 15 |
| Resource availability | 7 | 10 |
| Execution complexity | 6 | 10 |
| Imitation barrier | 7 | 10 |
| Adoption likelihood | 8 | 10 |

**Assessment:** Strong Blue Ocean opportunity. AI capability creates meaningful barrier. Target first-tier noncustomers (small businesses using templates) and second-tier (businesses avoiding legal services due to cost).

**Tagline:** "Your AI legal partner—always on, always affordable."
