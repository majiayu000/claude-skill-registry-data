# TPACK Framework

## Overview

TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) describes the knowledge teachers need for effective technology integration. It identifies seven knowledge domains formed by the intersections of Technology (TK), Pedagogy (PK), and Content (CK) knowledge, arguing that effective integration requires understanding all three simultaneously.

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- Evaluating whether technology use in instruction is pedagogically sound
- Designing teacher professional development for technology integration
- Assessing gaps in educator knowledge domains

**When NOT to use:**
- When classifying learning objectives by cognitive level (use Bloom's taxonomy)
- When designing scaffolded learning experiences (use constructivism)
- When evaluating information system quality (use IS Success Model)

## Assumptions

```
IRON LAW: Effective Technology Integration Requires ALL THREE Knowledge Types

Technology without pedagogy or content is just a tool, not instruction.
The seven domains:
  TK — Technology Knowledge (how tools work)
  PK — Pedagogical Knowledge (how to teach)
  CK — Content Knowledge (what to teach)
  TPK — How technology enables pedagogical strategies
  TCK — How technology represents content
  PCK — How to teach specific content (Shulman)
  TPACK — The intersection of ALL three: the sweet spot
Weakness in ANY domain degrades technology integration quality.
```

## Methodology

### Step 1: Map Knowledge Domains
Assess the current state of each knowledge domain (TK, PK, CK) and their intersections for the instructor or instructional context.

### Step 2: Identify Integration Opportunities
Find where technology can genuinely enhance pedagogy for specific content. Ask: "What can students do WITH technology that they couldn't do WITHOUT it?"

### Step 3: Design at the TPACK Intersection
Create learning activities where technology choice is driven by pedagogical purpose AND content requirements, not technology novelty.

### Step 4: Evaluate and Iterate
Assess whether the technology integration achieved learning goals. Check: Did technology serve the pedagogy? Did it represent content accurately? Was it accessible?

## Knowledge Domain Assessment
| Domain | Current State | Evidence | Gap |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----|
| TK | ... | ... | ... |
| PK | ... | ... | ... |
| CK | ... | ... | ... |
| TPK | ... | ... | ... |
| TCK | ... | ... | ... |
| PCK | ... | ... | ... |
| TPACK | ... | ... | ... |

## Technology Integration Design
- Content goal: {what students should learn}
- Pedagogical strategy: {how they will learn it}
- Technology role: {why this technology, specifically}
- TPACK alignment: {how all three intersect}

## Recommendations
{Targeted development for weakest domains}
```

## Gotchas

- **Technology for technology's sake**: The most common TPACK violation. Adding technology without clear pedagogical purpose (e.g., PowerPoint replacing a blackboard with no pedagogical change) is TK without TPK or TPACK.
- **TPACK is context-specific**: A teacher may have strong TPACK for one topic and weak TPACK for another. It's not a general trait — it varies by content area and technology type.
- **Measurement challenges**: TPACK is typically measured via self-report surveys, which inflate scores. Observation-based and performance-based assessments are more valid but harder to scale.
- **Rapid technology change**: TK decays quickly as technology evolves. TPACK development must be ongoing, not a one-time training event.
- **PCK is the foundation**: Shulman's PCK (knowing how to teach specific content) predates and underlies TPACK. Teachers weak in PCK cannot develop strong TPACK regardless of technology skills.
