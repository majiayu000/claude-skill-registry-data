# Tauri Stinger

Start with [README.md](README.md) for the workflow map and detailed references.

## Purpose

Equip `tauri-wasp-drone` to inspect, migrate, implement, secure, test, and distribute Tauri 2 desktop and mobile applications. It includes a dated six-month update sweep, compact primary-source captures, supplemental living baseline documentation, and derived patterns for hosted and local AI applications.

## When to use

- Creating, upgrading, or debugging a Tauri 2 desktop or mobile application
- Migrating a Tauri 1 project to Tauri 2
- Aligning `tauri`, `@tauri-apps/api`, CLI, plugin, runtime, Wry, or Tao versions
- Designing Rust commands, frontend `invoke`, events, Channels, managed state, or cancellation
- Configuring capabilities, permissions, scopes, CSP, remote origins, or sidecar access
- Building a hosted-provider, local-sidecar, native-runtime, or mobile-plugin AI feature
- Qualifying local import, export, app-data cleanup or uninstall without losing user documents
- Choosing Store, SQL, Stronghold, or managed state for application data
- Testing native behavior, building installers, signing, updating, or distributing a Tauri application
- Refreshing current Tauri 2 release and security notes from primary sources

## When not to use

- General Rust language, Cargo, async, unsafe, or library architecture unrelated to Tauri; use [rust-stinger](../rust-stinger).
- Frontend-framework component design or reactivity; use the relevant framework Stinger such as [svelte-stinger](https://github.com/legioncodeinc/vibe-coding-tools/blob/v3.0.1/plugins/web-development-tools/skills/svelte-stinger) or [react-stinger](https://github.com/legioncodeinc/vibe-coding-tools/blob/v3.0.1/plugins/web-development-tools/skills/react-stinger).
- Formal security audit of the resulting implementation; use [security-stinger](https://github.com/legioncodeinc/vibe-coding-tools/blob/v3.0.1/plugins/wasp-nest-core/skills/security-stinger) after Tauri implementation work.
- CI platform architecture or release automation beyond Tauri-specific integration; use [ci-release-stinger](https://github.com/legioncodeinc/vibe-coding-tools/blob/v3.0.1/plugins/platform-and-release-tools/skills/ci-release-stinger) or [devops-stinger](https://github.com/legioncodeinc/vibe-coding-tools/blob/v3.0.1/plugins/platform-and-release-tools/skills/devops-stinger).
- Dependency vulnerability triage, SBOMs, or update-bot policy; use [dependency-audit-stinger](https://github.com/legioncodeinc/vibe-coding-tools/blob/v3.0.1/plugins/wasp-nest-core/skills/dependency-audit-stinger).

## Procedure

1. **Establish authority and scope.** Read [guides/00-authority-and-scope.md](guides/00-authority-and-scope.md). Keep dated Tauri facts separate from derived AI designs.
2. **Inspect before editing.** Follow [guides/01-inspect-and-align.md](guides/01-inspect-and-align.md), resolve `scripts/inspect-tauri-project.py` relative to this loaded `SKILL.md`, and run `python <resolved-script-path> <project-root> --pretty` for a read-only JSON inventory.
3. **Refresh mutable versions.** Read [references/CURRENT-TAURI-2.md](references/CURRENT-TAURI-2.md) as a dated snapshot, then use [guides/09-refresh-current-tauri.md](guides/09-refresh-current-tauri.md) before making present-tense version claims.
4. **Migrate deliberately.** For Tauri 1, execute [guides/02-migrate-v1-to-v2.md](guides/02-migrate-v1-to-v2.md) in bounded slices and manually review generated capabilities.
5. **Design IPC and state.** Use [guides/03-design-ipc-and-state.md](guides/03-design-ipc-and-state.md) for typed commands, structured errors, ordered Channels, event cleanup, managed state, timeouts, and cancellation.
6. **Constrain authority and secrets.** Apply [guides/04-secure-capabilities-and-secrets.md](guides/04-secure-capabilities-and-secrets.md). Treat custom scope enforcement as authorization code and keep publisher-owned secrets outside the client.
7. **Choose the AI topology.** Use [guides/05-integrate-ai-runtimes.md](guides/05-integrate-ai-runtimes.md) and label the hosted-provider, desktop-sidecar, native-runtime, or mobile-plugin result as a derived application design.
8. **Classify persistence.** Follow [guides/06-persist-ai-state.md](guides/06-persist-ai-state.md) to separate preferences, structured records, user-owned secrets, and ephemeral runtime handles.
9. **Verify real behavior.** Follow [guides/07-test-desktop-and-mobile.md](guides/07-test-desktop-and-mobile.md). Distinguish mocked, browser-only, native, packaged, and physical-device evidence.
10. **Build and distribute.** For platform release qualification, use [macOS](guides/10-qualify-macos-release.md), [Windows](guides/11-qualify-windows-release.md), or [Linux](guides/12-qualify-linux-distribution.md) with the [evidence record](templates/native-release-qualification.md). Complete [guides/08-build-sign-update-distribute.md](guides/08-build-sign-update-distribute.md) and [references/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md](references/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md), then enter the Ship Gate.

## Desktop capability qualification update

For sidecar credentials use [guide 13](guides/13-qualify-sidecars-and-credential-brokers.md); for local schema upgrades and recoverable data use [guide 14](guides/14-qualify-local-data-migrations.md); for updater key/version/data transitions use [guide 15](guides/15-qualify-updater-trust-and-recovery.md); for tray, shortcuts and notifications use [guide 16](guides/16-qualify-tray-shortcuts-and-notifications.md); for real app acceptance beyond browser tests use [guide 17](guides/17-qualify-native-tests-beyond-the-browser.md). Read the 2026-10-07 evidence digest, complete [the record](templates/desktop-capability-evidence.md), and distinguish [synthetic decisions](examples/08-desktop-capability-decisions.md) and the [temporary SQLite exercise](examples/09-sqlite-recovery-exercise.py) from native app proof.

## References map

- [references/REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md), load for the full project, version, IPC, platform, escalation, and red-flag decision tables.
- [references/CURRENT-TAURI-2.md](references/CURRENT-TAURI-2.md), load before an update, migration, security-floor, or "latest version" question; every value is dated 2026-09-03.
- [references/IPC-SECURITY-REFERENCE.md](references/IPC-SECURITY-REFERENCE.md), load when designing commands, Channels, capabilities, scopes, CSP, sidecars, or secret boundaries.
- [references/AI-ARCHITECTURE-REFERENCE.md](references/AI-ARCHITECTURE-REFERENCE.md), load when choosing hosted, local, native, or mobile AI architecture and stream contracts.
- [references/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md](references/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md), load before packaging, signing, updating, publishing, or claiming release readiness.
- [references/research/distilled-tauri-2.md](references/research/distilled-tauri-2.md), load when a domain claim needs verification or a conflict needs resolution.
- Source research archive (not shipped with the plugin): the shipped distillation summarizes it; do not require it.
- `examples/`, load the one example matching the task: typed AI Channel, hosted command boundary, local sidecar, least-privilege capability, v1 migration, or signed updater flow.
- `templates/`, copy the relevant inspection, AI decision, capability review, upgrade plan, or release evidence template into the consumer repository's planning or report location.
- `scripts/inspect-tauri-project.py`, run for deterministic read-only discovery or with `--self-test` after maintaining the script.

## Local file safety update

For O105 use [bounded import](guides/18-qualify-local-import.md), [safe export](guides/19-qualify-safe-export.md) and [app-data uninstall](guides/20-qualify-app-data-uninstall.md). Read the 2026-10-08 digest, fill the [evidence worksheet](templates/file-safety-evidence.md), and review the [fictional plan](examples/10-fictional-file-safety-plan.md) and [negative decisions](examples/11-file-safety-negative-cases.md). File selection is not arbitrary file authority. Require operation-specific approval, native identity/race review, bounded parsing, qualified publication and app-owned cleanup provenance. User documents/exports remain retained. Constructed cases are NOT_RUN; current runtime/plugin/OS support and native durability/uninstall proof remain consumer obligations.

## Ship Gate

Prior to committing any code to the repository you must utilize in order the security-stinger, quality-stinger, and github-repo-health-stinger. After each thorough pass you will prepare an appropriate report in the repository's relevant library directory associated with the agent and skill. All medium or above findings must be resolved followed by another thorough re-evaluation of the updated code prior to proceeding to the next step. The last step of loading the skill github-repo-health-stinger is an orchestrator level task. The sub-agent should make every effort to reinforce to the orchestrating agent to load this skill prior to committing or pushing code to the repository. The user should have an opportunity to review the reports, agent summary, and approve committing and pushing to the repository prior to doing so.
