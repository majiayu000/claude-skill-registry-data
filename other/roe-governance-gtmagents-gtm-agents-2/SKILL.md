# Rules of Engagement Governance Skill

## When to Use
- Rolling out new territory models with updated ownership rules.
- Resolving channel, partner, or segment conflicts.
- Documenting escalation paths for deal desk, pricing, or product requests.

## Framework
1. **Stakeholder Map** – identify sales, CS, partner, legal, and ops owners.
2. **Rule Definition** – outline assignment logic, routing triggers, and timeframe SLAs.
3. **Exception Handling** – document approval tiers, SLAs, and data required for review.
4. **Enablement & Change Mgmt** – create briefs, FAQs, and office-hour plans.
5. **Compliance & Audit** – track decision logs, metrics, and quarterly refresh cadence.

## Templates
- ROE decision tree and ownership matrix.
- Exception request form + approval checklist.
- Communication kit (email, deck, FAQ) for GTM + partner teams.

## Tips
- Keep rules simple enough for reps/channel partners to recall.
- Tie every rule to a KPI (speed, fairness, CX) to reinforce intent.
- Archive exceptions in a shared system to surface policy drift.
