# Westlaw: retrieve a case as publisher-keyed DOCX

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

Export an opinion from Westlaw Advantage as DOCX with star pagination, for use as the
authoritative source text when excerpting. Feeds `workflows:elide-case`, whose first Iron Law
requires authentic reporter text.

Everything below was measured 2026-09-09 in a live session against Westlaw Advantage, signed in as
a UVA law faculty account.

## Prerequisite

The user's own logged-in Chromium on CDP port 9222. Linux → `mcp__chrome-devtools__*`. **Load the
`browser-automation` skill first** — it owns port and prefix selection. This drives the user's real
session; there is no credential handling and nothing to store.

LexisNexis (Lexis+ with Protégé) publishes no MCP server as of 2026-09, and Thomson Reuters'
CoCounsel connector returns synthesized research reports with citation links, not verbatim case
text (and needs a CoCounsel package subscription) — neither replaces this browser route.

## Step 0 — session preflight

Confirm the browser session is still signed in before driving it; an expired login presents as a
missing selector or a stalled delivery queue several steps later. On any Westlaw tab, evaluate:

```js
const r = await fetch('/V1/Delivery/Details?timeZoneId=Eastern%20Standard%20Time',
                      {credentials:'same-origin', redirect:'follow'});
const ct = r.headers.get('content-type') || '';
const body = await r.text();
JSON.stringify({status:r.status, host:new URL(r.url).host, ct, ok:(()=>{try{JSON.parse(body);return true}catch{return false}})()});
```

**PASS only on:** `status` 200 AND `ct` contains `application/json` AND the body parses as JSON AND
`host` is `1.next.westlaw.com`. Measured on a signed-in session: 200, `application/json;
charset=utf-8`, body begins `{"PollingIntervalInMilliseconds":0,"DeliveryQueueItems":[{"F`. This is
the same endpoint Step 5 polls, so it tests the capability the run needs.

Anything else — non-200, non-JSON content type, unparseable body, another final host, or a thrown
fetch — is NOT SIGNED IN. **STOP and tell the user to sign in to Westlaw in his own browser and
re-run.** Never attempt a login, fill a credential field, or touch a saved password; this skill
handles no credentials and Step 0 is not the exception.

**There is no DOM fallback: the API probe is the only session check.** Measured on one live
signed-in session, same browser, same moment: on `/Document/…/View/FullText.html` (case viewer)
`#coid_website_signOffRegion` → 1 and `#co_signOffContainer` → 1; on `/Advantage/Home` both → 0,
while the API probe passed on that same page (200, `application/json; charset=utf-8`, parseable,
`redirected:false`) and its visible text read "… Client: HU EDWIN Help Profile Sign out …". Those
IDs therefore indicate **which page is loaded**, not whether the session is live, and using them
yields a false "not signed in" — the same false-negative class already noted for
`#coid_website_userMenu`, `#co_signOffLink`, `a[href*="SignOff"]`, `#coid_headerLinks` and
`.co_user` (all measured absent while signed in). The only signal present on both tabs was the
page's own visible text containing "Sign out"; it is not carried here, because user-visible copy
Thomson Reuters can reword is too weak to sit beside the probe and must never override it.

The signed-out response shape is UNVERIFIED (never observed, since testing it means signing the user
out) — hence the fail-closed condition above; observing it once would allow a more specific message.

## Step 1 — find the case

Citation search navigates **directly to the document**; there is no results page to parse. Type the
citation into the main search box and submit, or navigate:

```
https://1.next.westlaw.com/Document/<docGuid>/View/FullText.html?userEnteredCitation=87+F.3d+536
```

Westlaw resolves the cite to its own docGuid server-side. Confirm by reading `document.title`,
which carries the case name. Measured: `87 F.3d 536` landed on
`I18e36046930e11d9bc61beebb95be672` / "S.E.C. v. Life Partners, Inc.".

**The jurisdiction filter does not affect a citation lookup but DOES silently narrow a term
search.** A term search returning nothing when the case plainly exists is usually the filter, not
the corpus.

## Step 2 — delivery dialog and the client-ID gate

| element | is |
|---|---|
| `#deliveryLinkButton1` | opens "Download This Document" |
| `#deliveryWidgetButton1` | "Delivery Options" |
| `a.co_blobLink.Athens-Document-Caption-pdfbutton` | "Download original image (PDF)" — direct blob URL to the **reporter page scan**, no dialog, no client ID |

**Clicking Download raises a "Select a client ID" modal whose own container renders EMPTY** (only a
close button). Its real control lives elsewhere in the DOM as `#co_clientID_recent_0`, labelled
with the user's client ID. Searching only inside the dialog node finds nothing and looks like a
broken page. Click `#co_clientID_recent_0`; the download dialog appears behind it.

The client ID is billing/matter attribution — for a law faculty account, typically the user's own
name. **Never select one the user has not named.** Attribution is theirs, not yours.

## Step 3 — format and layout

| element | set to |
|---|---|
| `#co_delivery_format_fulltext` | `<select>` → option "Microsoft Word (.docx)", value `XMLMIND_DOCX` |
| `#coid_chkDdcLayoutUseDualColumnsForCases` | UNCHECK |
| `#coid_chkDdcLayoutIncludeHeadnotes` | UNCHECK — West headnotes are editorial, not the court's words |
| `#coid_chkDdcLayoutInlineKeyCiteFlags` | UNCHECK — KeyCite markup pollutes verbatim matching |
| `#coid_chkDdcLayoutOriginalImageLink` | CHECK — embeds a pointer to the page scan |
| `#co_delivery_FullText` | radio, already checked = full text |
| `#co_delivery_StarPageRanges` | star pagination |

**DOCX, not PDF, and the reason is not preference.** A DOCX carries text in document order, so
there is no layout to misread. A PDF is positioned glyphs: extracting it means re-deriving reading
order — the exact failure that corrupted a two-column reporter page into
`The investors here relied on MBC to / are instructed to apply by Howey`, fused text no court wrote,
which read plausibly and reached print. Choosing PDF re-selects that bug.

RTF is the fallback if DOCX parsing misbehaves: plain text, diffable, lossier on structure. Legacy
`.doc` (OLE) and WordPerfect have no upside; Excel (CSV) is list export only.

## Step 4 — submit

```
#co_deliveryDownloadButton    input[type=button].co_primaryBtn.co_delivery_submitButton
```

**This button is NOT inside the dialog node.** Enumerating the dialog's children yields only tabs,
checkboxes and Cancel, and the only element labelled "Download" there is `#deliveryLinkButton1` —
the toolbar button that OPENED the dialog. Clicking that re-opens instead of submitting. Search the
document, not the dialog.

## Step 5 — the delivery is a QUEUED JOB

Measured request sequence after submit:

```
POST /V2/Delivery/InitiateDelivery
POST /V2/Delivery/CompleteDeliveryInitialization
GET  /V1/Delivery/Status/{transactionId}        (polled)
GET  /V1/Delivery/Details?timeZoneId=...        -> the queue record
```

`/V1/Delivery/Details` returns JSON: `FileName`, `FileSize`, `DeliveryFormat`, `ProgressStatus`,
`TransactionId`, `DeliveryId`, `ExpireDate`, `DownloadCount`. Wait for `ProgressStatus`
`"Completed"` and `ErrorDescription` `"Success"`.

**No request in that sequence returns the .docx body.** The file sits in Westlaw's delivery queue
until retrieved, expires at midnight the same day, and `DownloadCount` stays 0 until then.

**DO NOT GUESS THE RETRIEVAL ENDPOINT.** Six plausible URLs built from `DeliveryId` and
`TransactionId` — `/V1/Delivery/Download/{id}`, `/GetDocument/`, `/Retrieve/`, `/V2/...`,
query-string forms — ALL returned 404. The retrieval trigger is JS-bound with **no href** in the
DOM: the queue item is `li#0_qitem > a.co_deliveryQueue_item`, `href="javascript:void(0);"`. Open
the queue with `#dq_msgbar_button` and click that anchor. Guessing endpoints wastes calls and
teaches nothing; reading the UI found it immediately.

The click triggers a normal browser download into the user's Downloads directory. Move it from
there; nothing in the page hands you bytes.

## Step 6 — project the text (in memory; do NOT write a `.txt`)

**Westlaw's `XMLMIND_DOCX` uses a FLAT OPC layout, and it breaks standard tooling.** The parts sit
at the package **root** — `document.xml`, `footnotes.xml`, `header1.xml` — not under `word/`. It is
a valid zip and Word opens it, but python-docx and most libraries hardcode `word/document.xml` and
raise on open. Measured: 13 parts, no `word/` prefix anywhere.

**The docx is the only artifact this skill stores.** `scripts/westlaw-docx-text.py` is a
**projection**, not an export step: consumers import `project(path)` and read the text in memory.
A `.txt` written beside the docx is a second copy of the same opinion that nothing diffs — and the
one this skill used to write **discarded the docx's italic runs**, so a case name the court set in
italics reached a 27-page compiled casebook excerpt in roman, because the cut read only the
projection. Persisting the projection is what made that undetectable.

```bash
# For eyeballing only. -o writes a file, which is not how a consumer reads this.
scripts/westlaw-docx-text.py <in.docx>
```

Reads `document.xml` from the zip root (falling back to `word/document.xml` so a normal docx also
works, and saying which layout it found), walks `<w:r>` runs inside each `<w:p>`, **wraps every run
carrying `<w:i/>` in Typst emphasis (`_..._`)**, unescapes entities, drops empties, and reports
paragraph count, character count, emphasis spans and star-page markers to stderr. Emphasis is on by
default; `--no-emphasis` reproduces the old flat read for diffing and is not a source to cut from.
Measured:

| export | docx | paragraphs | chars | markers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC v. Life Partners, 87 F.3d 536 | 50,078 B | 138 | 90,972 | 42 |
| SEC v. Ripple, 682 F. Supp. 3d 308 | 49,381 B | 202 | 76,239 | 22 |
| SEC v. Mutual Benefits, 408 F.3d 737 | 22,314 B | 78 | 27,130 | 8 |

All three are flat OPC, 13 parts. **Those counts are the `--no-emphasis` read** — the default
emphasis read is longer by two characters per span, so a character count that does not match this
table is the emphasis marks, not damage. Measured 2026-09-10 on Tornetta v. Musk (253,642 B, 2,467
paragraphs, 234 markers): 369,296 chars flat, 371,130 with emphasis, **917 spans** — including 19
`_Weinberger_` and one `_MFW_`, every one of which the persisted `.txt` had discarded.

## Naming and layout of a retrieved case

Per case, in the consumer's `docs/`:

```
<Case-slug>.westlaw.docx   the export, byte-for-byte as Westlaw delivered it — the ONLY artifact
```

Slug is party-v-party, volume, reporter, court, year:
`SEC-v-Ripple-682-FSupp3d-308-SDNY-2023`.

**One file per case. Write no `.txt` twin.** The projection is regenerable at any time from the
docx, which is what makes storing it pointless and losing its italics to it possible. A Westlaw
source needs no corrections ledger either: the reproduction check is re-running the projection.

## Star pagination

Markers appear inline, mid-sentence, immediately before the first word of the new reporter page.
A case reported in two reporters carries **two interleaved series, and the parallel one takes a
DOUBLE asterisk** — measured in Life Partners, 21 `*537`-style markers for 87 F.3d alternating with
21 `**304`-style markers for 318 U.S.App.D.C.:

```
the direction of its former president and current chairman *538 **304 Brian Pardo, arranges these
```

Strip with `\*\*?\d+`; a `\*\d+` pattern matches inside `**304` and leaves a stray asterisk, and
counts the two series as one (which is why the extractor reports 42, not 21 + 21).

Both uses are real. A consumer matching quoted text against the extraction must strip markers
first. A consumer that wants to PRINT star pages has them available and should not strip.

## Coverage

Westlaw is the best available source, **not ground truth** — it is one publisher's keying of the
reporter page, not the page itself. This does not eliminate the need to eyeball retained passages
against a page image where one exists (Step 2's original-image PDF is that image).

## Why publisher text, stated once

The free corpora are not independent. CourtListener's opinion text and the Caselaw Access Project's
JSON for 87 F.3d 536 carry **byte-identical OCR damage** (`is 'rue`, `Junctions`, `{per curiam)`),
because both descend from the same Harvard scan. Two OCR engines — CAP's and a blinded tesseract at
400dpi — both failed on the damaged `t` in `true`. The Westlaw DOCX resolved all three passages
correctly, including `Entrepreneurial functions` (lowercase, which a context-based guess got wrong
as `Functions`). Publisher-keyed text is not a marginal improvement over OCR here; it is the
difference between a reading and a reconstruction.

Record provenance as `westlaw-docx`. Westlaw with star pagination is what legal academics actually
cite — a legitimate source of record, not a stand-in for the bound volume.

## Red flags — STOP

| About to | Do instead |
|---|---|
| Debug a missing selector or a stalled delivery queue | Run Step 0 first — an expired session presents as a broken page |
| Export as PDF because it "looks like the reporter" | DOCX — PDF re-introduces layout extraction, the bug that fused two columns into text no court wrote. Use the original-image PDF only as the SCAN record |
| Guess a delivery retrieval URL from `DeliveryId` | Read the UI — six guessed endpoints all 404'd; the trigger is a JS-bound queue item |
| Open the export with python-docx | Flat OPC — read `document.xml` from the zip ROOT |
| Write a `.westlaw.txt` beside the docx | The projection is in memory. A stored twin drops the court's italics and nothing diffs it back |
| Reach for the CourtListener/RECAP route while Westlaw covers the case | That route yields a court PDF with **no formatting layer**, so italics cannot be recovered from it at all. It stays, for cases Westlaw lacks and for an expired session, and a consumer on it must say italics went unchecked |
| Pick a client ID to get past the modal | That is billing attribution; ask the user |
| Look for the submit button inside the dialog | It is outside; the in-dialog "Download" re-opens the dialog |
| Leave headnotes or KeyCite flags in the export | West editorial matter is not the court's words and breaks verbatim matching |
