# AMQ CLI

Use the `amq` CLI for all queue operations. Never edit Maildir files directly.
AMQ transports coordination; the caller or orchestrator still owns task planning,
worktrees, approvals, and delivery.

## Start in the correct context

Inside `coop exec`, use the environment as provided and run bare `amq` commands.
Do not override `--me` or reconstruct the root. Outside it, resolve and export the
complete context before reading or sending:

```bash
amq_context="$(amq env --me "<handle>" --export)" && eval "$amq_context" &&
  amq drain --include-body
```

For a named session, add `--session <name>` to `amq env`. Treat the evaluated
context as one terminal bound to one session. Use `--session` or `--project` for
deliberate routing; do not point a participating command at another queue with a
raw `--root`.

## Receive under a live wake

If session-start context says `wake=live(...)`, or
`amq wake check --me <handle> --json` reports `live_wake: true` with an
injection mode other than `none`, the wake delivers a doorbell for you.
Run `amq drain --include-body` when it fires, then act on the messages.

Do not run `amq watch`, `amq monitor`, sleep-poll, or start another inbox
watcher under that live wake. A blocking wait holds your turn while the
doorbell queues behind it. When your work is done, finish the turn; do not
keep a tool running or send idle check-ins just to wait for mail.

Without an injecting wake, use the receive methods in the operations guide.
A notify-only wake (`--inject-mode none`) paired with a supervisor `monitor`
service is a separate supported setup.

## Route the task

| Need | Read or run |
|---|---|
| Send, reply, drain, inspect receipts, or diagnose | Use [the operations guide](references/operations.md). |
| Two-agent research and design | Use the `amq-spec` skill. |
| Co-op roles and phased collaboration | Read [co-op mode](references/coop-mode.md). |
| Claude Code Agent Teams | Read [swarm mode](references/swarm-mode.md). |
| Cross-project delivery or decision threads | Read [cross-project routing](references/cross-project.md). |
| Grok Bot on a registered Mac | Read [registered-machine execution](references/registered-machine.md). |
| Symphony or Kanban adapters | Read [integrations](references/integrations.md). |
| Message schema details | Read [message format](references/message-format.md). |
| Multi-round background review | Read [review loop](references/review-loop.md). |
| Attach to a running harness session | Read the [amq-remote reference](https://github.com/avivsinai/agent-message-queue/blob/main/cmd/amq-remote/README.md). |

Use `amq <command> --help` for current flags. The repository README is the
canonical setup path.

## Remote

`amq-remote` is a companion binary, not an `amq` subcommand. It attaches to a
harness session that is already running. Targets are declared in
`<AM_ROOT>/extensions/remote/manifest.json` (`claude`, `codex`, `pi`, or
`fake`). `up` supervises the endpoint; `submit`, `status`, `wait`, and
`cancel` talk to it; `share` mints the session body key. A manifest `relay`
object shares a target with its owner over a Buzz relay. DM commands require
the pinned `native_session_id` and run only while that session is attached;
Desktop presence reports the attachment status and honors the pin when one
is set.
`doctor` lists each failing boundary under `failing` and exits 6 while any
remains. Flags and exit codes
are in the [amq-remote reference](https://github.com/avivsinai/agent-message-queue/blob/main/cmd/amq-remote/README.md). The design is
[the remote-control ADR](https://github.com/avivsinai/agent-message-queue/blob/main/docs/adr-remote-control.md). Pinned seams are
[the compatibility manifest](https://github.com/avivsinai/agent-message-queue/blob/main/docs/remote-compat.md).

## Safety and delivery rules

- A wake notification is attention, not consumption proof. Use receipts or
  `--wait-for drained` when delivery proof matters.
- Preserve the existing thread when replying. Drain again after a doorbell;
  the newest complete message body is authoritative.
- Cleanup is explicit through `amq cleanup`. Do not add automatic deletion.
- Before any wake mutation, run `amq wake check --me "<handle>" --json`. Act only
  when `restart_capability=agent_safe`; otherwise preserve state and report the
  required operator action.
- Keep cross-host payloads outside privileged inboxes until the configured
  bridge has authenticated and applied them. Never copy or remote-drain a
  foreign Maildir as a substitute for routing.
- Do not translate native Windows injection into Unix `wake` or `coop exec`.
  Read the platform section in the operations guide when Windows is involved.
- Dangerous provider bypass flags belong only on an operator-controlled direct
  `coop exec` command. Do not place them in committed launch configuration.

The full command catalog, environment precedence, setup flow, platform notes,
operator gates, and examples are in [the operations guide](references/operations.md).
