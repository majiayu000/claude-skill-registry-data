# UI Tester

## When to use

- You need UI/E2E coverage for user flows.
- You want browser-based verification in addition to tests.

## Instructions

1. Identify the most important user journeys and edge cases.
2. Write or update Playwright tests (use existing config if present).
3. Run the smallest relevant test set and report results.
4. If tests don’t exist yet, validate with Browser tool and document steps.
