# /hep-local

Raw request: `$ARGUMENTS`

Act as the temporary top-level workforce orchestrator. Use the local Agentlas
OS MCP server `hephaestus-network` and call the Workforce tools with exact
`sourceScope: "local"`. Before every unpinned discovery, Core refreshes the
current safe snapshot for each active registered Local source, creating a new
release when the source folder changed. This command searches only that
registered Local inventory; it must not add owner Cloud or public Hub
candidates. A prepared or goal-bound selection remains pinned to its exact
release. `network reindex` rebuilds the card cache but is not the release
refresh mechanism, and a new source still requires explicit registration.

1. Author a redacted `agentlas.workforce-work-order.v1`; private project
   grounding stays on-host.
2. Call `workforce.search_candidates` with
   `{workOrder, sourceScope: "local"}` and keep the complete response as
   `federationResult`, including its local registry receipt and the projected
   menu's `selectionSessionId`. Do not echo the projected menu back as
   `federationResult` — Core resolves the complete federation state locally
   from that session.
3. Author the final `agentlas.workforce-selection.v1` as the active host LLM,
   then call `workforce.validate_selection` with
   `{workOrder, selection}` and keep the response as `federatedSelection`. Revise on
   rejection; do not accept a
   deterministic picker or unrelated fallback.
4. Call `workforce.prepare_execution` with
   `{workOrder, selection, federatedSelection, projectDir}`. Require every
   selected row to remain pinned to source `local`, exact package/content
   identity, runtime bundle, permission policy, and context digest.
5. Execute distinct planner/manager, worker, synthesis, and verifier calls with
   explicit artifact handoffs. Preserve packaged Team graphs.

If the local Core MCP or registered inventory is unavailable, report
`source_unavailable`; do not silently search Cloud or Hub. A prepared roster is
not proof of execution.

For a `partial` or `failed` result, report each source receipt's exact
`failureCode`. Never collapse several receipts into one, substitute a different
code, or relabel the outcome.
