The user wants to save what was done in this session as a reusable Claude Code skill.

## Steps

1. **Review the session**: Look at what was accomplished — the tools used, files modified, commands run, and the overall workflow.

2. **Identify the reusable pattern**: What was the core workflow or technique? Strip away project-specific details and extract the generalizable process.

3. **Ask the user**:
   - "What should this skill be called?" (suggest a name based on what was done)
   - "Should this be a project skill (.claude/skills/) or a personal skill (~/.claude/skills/)?"
   - "Should only you be able to invoke it, or should Claude use it automatically when relevant?"

4. **Create the skill**: Write the SKILL.md file with:
   - YAML frontmatter: name, description, and \`disable-model-invocation: true\` if user-only
   - Clear step-by-step instructions based on what was done
   - Use \`$ARGUMENTS\` for any variable parts (file names, branch names, etc.)
   - Keep it under 500 lines — move detailed reference to supporting files if needed

5. **Verify**: Show the user the created skill and explain how to invoke it with /skill-name.

## Important

- Don't include project-specific file paths — use patterns like "src/routes/" not absolute paths
- Include any commands that should be run (test, lint, build)
- If the workflow has multiple variants, use $ARGUMENTS to parameterize
