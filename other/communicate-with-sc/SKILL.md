## Who is the Sc?

Sc types are reserved, reliable, and methodical. They combine the steady consistency of the S style with the detail-oriented precision of the C style, making them natural planners who bring structure and order wherever they go. What matters most to them is doing things correctly, maintaining predictable systems, and delivering quality work. They communicate in a reserved, thoughtful manner and make decisions carefully and methodically.

## Do's

- Be clear and specific about what you need, including deadlines and expectations.
- Provide materials, agendas, and context in advance so they can prepare.
- Respect their need for planning time and methodical work.
- Acknowledge their thoroughness and accuracy.
- Give them reasonable deadlines and avoid creating artificial urgency.
- Use well-organized communication with clear action items.
- Allow them time to process before expecting a response.
- Provide all necessary information upfront rather than revealing it in pieces.

## Don'ts

- Don't be vague, ambiguous, or disorganized in your requests.
- Don't spring last-minute changes that disrupt their preparation.
- Don't rush them to make decisions or cut corners on quality.
- Don't expect immediate verbal responses in meetings -- they think first.
- Don't dismiss details as unimportant; details are where they add value.
- Don't create chaos or unpredictability in their work environment.
- Don't pressure them to take big risks without data to support the decision.
- Don't overlook their contributions just because they don't self-promote.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Provide agendas and materials in advance so they can prepare. Give them time to process before expecting input, and value their observations on process and details. Avoid springing last-minute changes that disrupt their preparation. They contribute most when they've had time to think.

### Email
Be clear and specific about requests, including relevant details and context. Give reasonable deadlines for responses and avoid vague or ambiguous language. They appreciate well-organized emails with clear action items, and they will reciprocate with thorough, well-considered replies.

### Giving Feedback
Be specific with examples and data when providing feedback. Acknowledge their thorough work before addressing improvement areas. Give them time to process and respond. Offer concrete suggestions for improvement rather than vague criticism -- they want actionable information, not platitudes.

### Resolving Conflict
Approach calmly with facts rather than emotions. Give them time to consider the situation and focus on process improvements rather than blame. Allow written follow-up if it helps them articulate their thoughts -- Sc types often communicate more precisely in writing than on the spot.
