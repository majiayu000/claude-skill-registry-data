# Research Workflow

## Overview

research-workflow provides systematic multi-source research by orchestrating skill-researcher operations in optimal sequence.

**Component Skill**: skill-researcher (all 5 operations)

**Workflow** (5 steps):
1. **Web Search Research** - Find best practices, recent information
2. **GitHub Repository Research** - Discover code patterns, implementations
3. **Documentation Research** - Study official docs, specifications
4. **MCP Server Research** - Explore relevant MCP servers (if applicable)
5. **Synthesize Findings** - Aggregate and consolidate all sources

**Result**: Comprehensive research synthesis from multiple credible sources

## When to Use

- Researching for new skill development
- Investigating unfamiliar domains
- Gathering implementation patterns
- Technology/library research
- Best practices discovery

## Research Workflow

### Step 1: Web Search Research
Search for best practices, recent blog posts, community knowledge.

**Time**: 15-30 minutes

---

### Step 2: GitHub Repository Research
Find code examples, implementation patterns, community projects.

**Time**: 20-40 minutes

---

### Step 3: Documentation Research
Study official documentation, specifications, API references.

**Time**: 20-40 minutes

---

### Step 4: MCP Server Research (Optional)
Explore relevant MCP servers if domain has them.

**Time**: 15-30 minutes (skip if N/A)

---

### Step 5: Synthesize Findings
Aggregate all sources, identify patterns, create synthesis document.

**Time**: 30-60 minutes

## Quick Reference

### The 5-Step Research Workflow

| Step | Source | Time | Output |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| 1 | Web Search | 15-30m | Best practices, recent info |
| 2 | GitHub | 20-40m | Code patterns, examples |
| 3 | Documentation | 20-40m | Official specs, APIs |
| 4 | MCP Servers | 15-30m | Server capabilities (optional) |
| 5 | Synthesis | 30-60m | Research synthesis document |

**Total Time**: 2-3.5 hours

**Result**: research-synthesis.md with 3-5 sources, identified patterns, best practices

**Use in**: development-workflow Step 1 (research phase)
