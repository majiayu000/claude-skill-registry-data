### Step 2: Gather Input

- Goal (engagement, traffic, awareness, sales)
- Content type (image, video, carousel, story)

**Optional:**

- Brand voice guidelines
- Target audience
- Specific CTA

### Step 3: Hook Formulas

**Attention-grabbing openers:**

| Hook Type     | Example                                           | Best For    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Question      | "Ever wondered why your posts flop?"              | Engagement  |
| Bold claim    | "This changed everything for me."                 | Authority   |
| Curiosity gap | "I tried this for 30 days. Here's what happened." | Stories     |
| Controversy   | "Unpopular opinion: [statement]"                  | Discussion  |
| List teaser   | "3 things nobody tells you about..."              | Value posts |
| Story intro   | "Last week, something unexpected happened."       | Personal    |
| How-to        | "Here's exactly how I [achieved X]"               | Tutorials   |
| Statistic     | "97% of people get this wrong."                   | Education   |

### Step 4: Platform Templates

**Instagram (Feed Post):**

```
[Hook - attention grabber]

[Value - 2-3 short paragraphs with line breaks]

[Story or insight - personal connection]

[CTA - engagement question]

.
.
.

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5
```

**Instagram example:**

```
Stop making this rookie mistake with your images. 👇

I spent 3 hours editing photos last week.
Then I discovered this one setting that does it automatically.

The difference? 2 minutes vs 2 hours.
Same quality. 10x faster.

Here's the exact process I use now (save this):

1️⃣ Open your editing app
2️⃣ Go to Presets > Auto-enhance
3️⃣ Adjust only exposure and contrast
4️⃣ Export at 80% quality

That's it. The algorithm can't tell the difference.
Your followers won't either.

```

**LinkedIn:**

```
[Hook - professional insight or contrarian take]

[Context - industry observation or personal experience]

[Value - key insights with line breaks between points]

[Proof - data, result, or example]

[CTA - question or discussion prompt]

---

[Hashtags at bottom, 3-5 max]
```

**LinkedIn example:**

```
I've reviewed 500+ developer portfolios this year.

90% make the same mistake.

They list technologies. Not outcomes.

Here's what actually gets interviews:

→ "Built a React app" ❌
→ "Built a React app that reduced load time by 40%" ✅

→ "Experience with PostgreSQL" ❌
→ "Optimized PostgreSQL queries, saving $2k/month in server costs" ✅

The pattern is simple:

Technology + Impact = Interview

Hiring managers don't care what you know.
They care what you can DO with what you know.

Next time you update your portfolio, ask:
"So what?" after every bullet point.

If you can't answer that, rewrite it.

What's the best portfolio advice you've received?

**Twitter/X (Single Tweet):**

```
[Hook - punchy opening]

[Value or insight - 1-2 lines]

[CTA or punchline]
```

**Twitter/X example:**

```
Most developers optimize for the wrong thing.

They chase speed.
When they should chase clarity.

Fast code that nobody understands is slow code.
```

**Twitter/X (Thread opener):**

```
[Hook with promise]

🧵 Thread:
```

**TikTok:**

```
[Hook matching video content]

[Context or setup]

[CTA - follow, comment, or save]

#trending1 #niche2 #topic3
```

**TikTok example:**

```
POV: You just learned this coding trick exists 🤯

I've been writing JavaScript for 5 years and never knew this.

### Step 5: Hashtag Strategy

**Hashtag tiers:**

| Tier    | Volume    | Example              | Use                      |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Broad   | 1M+ posts | #marketing           | 1 per post (reach)       |
| Medium  | 100K-1M   | #contentmarketing    | 2-3 per post (balance)   |
| Niche   | 10K-100K  | #b2bcontentmarketing | 2-3 per post (targeting) |
| Branded | Any       | #yourbrand           | 1 per post (tracking)    |

**Platform-specific:**

| Platform  | Hashtag Approach                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Instagram | 5-10 in first comment or caption end |
| LinkedIn  | 3-5 at caption bottom                |
| Twitter/X | 1-2 integrated in text               |
| TikTok    | 3-5 trending + niche mix             |

**Research hashtags:**

```
# Check hashtag volume
- Instagram: Search hashtag, see post count
- LinkedIn: Search hashtag, see follower count
- TikTok: Search hashtag, see view count
```

### Step 6: CTAs by Goal

| Goal       | CTA Examples                                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Engagement | "What do you think?", "Drop a 🔥 if you agree"      |
| Saves      | "Save this for later", "Bookmark this"              |
| Shares     | "Tag someone who needs this", "Share with a friend" |
| Comments   | "Tell me your experience", "What's your take?"      |
| Follows    | "Follow for more", "Hit follow for daily tips"      |
| Traffic    | "Link in bio", "Full guide in comments"             |
| Sales      | "DM me [word]", "Grab yours at [link]"              |

### Step 7: Optimal Posting Times

| Platform  | Best Days     | Best Times (local) |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Instagram | Tue, Wed, Fri | 11am, 2pm, 7pm     |
| LinkedIn  | Tue, Wed, Thu | 7am, 12pm, 5pm     |
| Twitter/X | Mon-Fri       | 8am, 12pm, 5pm     |
| TikTok    | Tue, Thu, Fri | 7pm, 9pm           |
| Facebook  | Wed, Fri      | 1pm, 3pm           |

_Note: Test with your specific audience; analytics override general guidelines._

### Step 8: Content Type Formats

**Carousel (Instagram/LinkedIn):**

```
Slide 1: Hook headline
Slide 2-8: Value points (one per slide)
Slide 9: Summary/recap
Slide 10: CTA + follow prompt
```

**Story (Instagram):**

```
Frame 1: Hook question or statement
Frame 2-4: Content/value
Frame 5: Poll, quiz, or question sticker
```

**Reel/TikTok:**

```
Caption: [Hook matching first 3 seconds]

[Brief context if needed]

[CTA - follow/comment/save]

[Hashtags - trending + niche]
```

## Output Format

```markdown
## [Platform] Caption

**Post Type:** [image/video/carousel/story]
**Goal:** [engagement/traffic/awareness/sales]

---

[Full caption with formatting]

---

**Hashtags:** #tag1 #tag2 #tag3
**Best Time to Post:** [day, time]
**CTA Type:** [engagement/save/share/traffic]
```

## Multi-Platform Adaptation

When adapting one message across platforms:

| Platform  | Adaptation                                   |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| LinkedIn  | Add professional context, industry relevance |
| Instagram | Make visual, add emojis, storytelling        |
| Twitter/X | Condense to essence, punchy delivery         |
| TikTok    | Casual tone, trending sounds/hooks reference |

## Validation

Before completing:

- [ ] Hook grabs attention in first line
- [ ] Length appropriate for platform
- [ ] Tone matches platform norms
- [ ] Hashtags researched and relevant
- [ ] CTA aligns with goal
- [ ] Formatting uses line breaks appropriately
- [ ] Emojis used strategically (not excessively)

## Error Handling

- **No clear topic**: Ask for content theme or link to share.
- **Wrong tone for platform**: Adjust formality (LinkedIn ≠ TikTok).
- **Too long**: Cut secondary points; focus on one core message.
- **Generic hashtags**: Research niche tags with 10K-500K posts.
- **No CTA**: Every post needs a clear next step.
