# Landing Page Optimizer

Transform underperforming landing pages into conversion machines. This skill combines copywriting expertise, UX best practices, and conversion psychology to systematically improve every element of your landing pages.

Most landing pages leave massive value on the table. Small changes to headlines, CTAs, social proof placement, and form design can dramatically increase conversion rates. This skill provides a systematic audit framework, prioritized optimization recommendations, and testing strategies to continuously improve performance.

Built for marketers, growth teams, product managers, and anyone responsible for landing page performance and conversion rates.

## Best Practices

- **5-second test** - If unclear in 5 seconds, you've lost them
- **Reduce form fields** - Every field costs conversions
- **CTA above and below fold** - Multiple opportunities to convert
- **Specific > vague** - "Get your free PDF" beats "Submit"
- **Social proof near CTA** - Reduce anxiety at decision point
- **Mobile is primary** - Most traffic is mobile
- **Speed matters** - Every second costs conversions
- **Remove navigation** - Keep focus on conversion goal
- **Use directional cues** - Eyes and arrows guide attention
- **Test one element** - Isolate variables for clean data
- **Don't test too early** - Need volume for significance
- **Document everything** - Build institutional knowledge
