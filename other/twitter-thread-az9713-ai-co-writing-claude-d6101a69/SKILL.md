# Twitter/X Thread Creator

Create high-performing Twitter threads that educate, tell stories, and drive engagement.

## Before Writing

1. **Read context profiles**:
   - `/context/voice-dna.json` - Match authentic voice
   - `/context/icp.json` - Write for target audience
   - `/context/business-profile.json` - Reference when relevant

2. **Check knowledge base** for content to repurpose from `/knowledge/`

## Thread Specifications

- **Tweet limit**: 280 characters per tweet
- **Ideal length**: 7-15 tweets
- **Maximum**: 25 tweets (attention drops after)
- **Format**: First tweet is the hook, last tweet is CTA

## Thread Frameworks

### Framework 1: How-To Thread
```
Tweet 1: [HOOK - Result they'll get]
Tweet 2: [Context/Why this matters]
Tweet 3-N: [Step-by-step process]
Final: [Summary + CTA]
```

### Framework 2: Story Thread
```
Tweet 1: [HOOK - Outcome or tension]
Tweet 2: [Setting the scene]
Tweet 3-N: [The story unfolds]
Second-to-last: [The lesson]
Final: [CTA]
```

### Framework 3: Listicle Thread
```
Tweet 1: [HOOK - What they'll learn, e.g., "10 lessons from..."]
Tweet 2-N: [One item per tweet]
Final: [Summary + CTA]
```

### Framework 4: Contrarian Thread
```
Tweet 1: [HOOK - Controversial statement]
Tweet 2: [Common belief you're challenging]
Tweet 3-N: [Your argument with evidence]
Second-to-last: [What to do instead]
Final: [CTA]
```

### Framework 5: Case Study Thread
```
Tweet 1: [HOOK - The result achieved]
Tweet 2: [Who/what this is about]
Tweet 3: [The starting point/problem]
Tweet 4-N: [What was done]
Second-to-last: [Results + key takeaway]
Final: [CTA]
```

### Framework 6: Breakdown Thread
```
Tweet 1: [HOOK - What you're breaking down]
Tweet 2: [Why this matters]
Tweet 3-N: [Each component explained]
Final: [Summary + CTA]
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Hook (Tweet 1)
This is everything. Must stop the scroll.

**Hook formulas:**
- "I [did thing]. Here's what happened:"
- "[Number] [things] that [result]:"
- "In [time period], I went from [A] to [B]. Here's how:"
- "Most people think [common belief]. They're wrong."
- "The [topic] advice nobody talks about:"
- "[Famous person/company] did [thing]. Here's the breakdown:"

### Body Tweets
- One idea per tweet
- Start with strong first word
- End tweets at natural break points
- Use numbers for lists
- Include specific examples

### Final Tweet (CTA)
Options:
- "Follow for more [topic]"
- "If this was helpful, RT the first tweet"
- "Want more? [Link to newsletter]"
- "What would you add? Reply below"
- Combine: "Follow + RT + Link"

### Formatting Rules
- Short sentences
- Line breaks between ideas
- Numbers > words ("5" not "five")
- Bullets/dashes for lists
- Emojis: use sparingly to match voice

## Thread Structure Template

```
🧵 THREAD:

1/ [HOOK - Stop the scroll]

2/ [Context or setup]

3/ [First main point]

4/ [Second main point]

5/ [Third main point]

...continue...

N-1/ [Key takeaway or lesson]

N/ [CTA - Follow, RT, Link]

---END THREAD---
```

## Output Format

```
THREAD: [Topic/Title]
FRAMEWORK: [Which framework used]
LENGTH: [Number of tweets]

---

1/ [Tweet 1 - HOOK]
[Character count: X/280]

2/ [Tweet 2]
[Character count: X/280]

...

N/ [Final tweet - CTA]
[Character count: X/280]

---

STANDALONE TWEET (for reposting hook):
[The hook tweet that can stand alone]
```

## Batch Generation

When asked for multiple thread ideas:

1. Provide 5-10 hook options
2. Let user select favorites
3. Develop full threads from chosen hooks

## Thread Quality Checklist

Before delivering:

- [ ] Hook creates immediate curiosity
- [ ] Each tweet under 280 characters
- [ ] One idea per tweet
- [ ] Smooth flow between tweets
- [ ] Voice matches voice DNA
- [ ] ICP would find valuable
- [ ] Has clear CTA at end
- [ ] Could go viral (shareable insight)
- [ ] First tweet works standalone

## Repurposing for Threads

When converting long-form content:

1. Identify the core insight/story
2. Extract 7-15 key points
3. Write hook based on main takeaway
4. One point per tweet
5. Add transitions between tweets
6. Create compelling CTA

## What to Avoid

- Threads that could be one tweet
- Vague or generic hooks
- Tweets that don't standalone
- Too much self-promotion
- No clear value for reader
- Walls of text in tweets
- Burying the lead
- Weak CTAs

## Example Thread

```
1/ I spent $50,000 on courses last year.

Most were garbage.

But 3 changed everything.

Here's what made them different (and what to look for):

2/ First: They had a clear outcome.

Not "learn marketing"
But "get 10 clients in 30 days"

Specificity = accountability.

3/ Second: The creator was still doing the thing.

Not "I made money 5 years ago"
But "Here's what's working NOW"

Recency matters.

4/ Third: They had a community.

Courses are lonely.
Communities create accountability.

The $500 course with active Discord > $5,000 course alone.

5/ The pattern:

✓ Specific outcome
✓ Recent practitioner
✓ Active community

Miss any of these? Skip it.

6/ Want to see my top 3?

Drop a "🔥" and I'll share the list.

Follow @handle for more lessons from building in public.
