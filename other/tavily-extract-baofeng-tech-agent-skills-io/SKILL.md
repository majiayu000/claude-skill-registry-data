# AIsa Tavily Extract

Extract clean, readable content from one or more URLs using the Tavily Extract endpoint via AIsa API. Converts web pages into structured text, stripping ads, navigation, and other noise.

## Setup

This skill requires the `AISA_API_KEY` environment variable. When installed as a Claude plugin, the key is configured via the environment variables.

## Usage

Run the search client with the `extract` subcommand:

```bash
python3 scripts/search_client.py extract --urls "<comma-separated URLs>"
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--urls` / `-u` | Yes | — | Comma-separated list of URLs to extract content from |

### Examples

```bash
# Extract a single article
python3 scripts/search_client.py extract --urls "https://example.com/article"

# Extract multiple pages
python3 scripts/search_client.py extract --urls "https://example.com/page1,https://example.com/page2"
```

## Output

For each URL, the script prints:
- **URL** — The source URL
- **Content** — Clean extracted text (up to 3000 characters per page)

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user provides a URL and wants to read or analyze its content, or when you need to fetch the full text of an article found via search. This is the best tool for "read this page" or "summarize this URL" requests.
