# discord-bot-stinger

Start with [README.md](README.md) for the workflow map and detailed references.

Equips `discord-bot-wasp-drone` to build, review, and audit Discord bots and applications on the 2026 Discord API surface. Read this file first on every invocation, then follow the guide pointer for the specific task.

## Critical directives (non-negotiables)

Every code sample, review comment, and recommendation from this stinger must respect:

1. **Never hardcode bot tokens or client secrets.** Use `process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN` (JS) or `os.environ["DISCORD_TOKEN"]` (Python). Tokens committed to source are harvested by secret-scanning bots immediately.
2. **Always specify the minimum required Gateway Intents.** Over-privileged intents trigger the Privileged Intent approval gate, slow verification, and increase PII exposure. See `guides/03-gateway-intents.md`.
3. **Pin SDK major versions in package manifests.** discord.js and discord.py introduce breaking changes. Unpinned installs silently break bots in CI.
4. **Surface bot-verification at 75 servers, not 100.** The verification application takes 1-5 business days; missing the gate hard-blocks new guild joins. See `guides/06-verification-checklist.md`.
5. **Register commands to a test guild during development.** Global registration has ~1 hour propagation delay; guild-scoped is instant. See `guides/02-slash-commands.md`.
6. **Do not recommend Wavelink.** It is abandoned. Use Mafic/lavalink.py (Python) or Shoukaku/Lavalink-Client (Node.js). See `guides/04-voice-pipeline.md`.
7. **All new voice code must use DAVE-compliant clients.** The DAVE E2EE protocol is mandatory in all voice channels since March 1, 2026.

## Open questions (flagged by scripture-historian)

> **TODO: stinger-forge open questions; resolve before next refresh:**

1. **Serenity/Poise (Rust)**: API surface not fully covered in research. Guides reference Rust conceptually; confirm `poise` slash command macro syntax from `docs.rs/poise` before next refresh.
2. **DisTube DAVE support**: Not confirmed. `guides/04-voice-pipeline.md` omits DisTube from active recommendations until DAVE compatibility is verified at `github.com/skick1234/DisTube`.
3. **Lavalink 4 Docker Compose YAML**: Reference snippet not retrieved. `guides/04-voice-pipeline.md` provides the install URL; embed the snippet on next refresh.
4. **discord.js REST rate-limit knobs**: Specific `RESTOptions` fields not retrieved. `guides/05-scaling-ops.md` covers the pattern; add specific field names on next refresh.
5. **Pycord vs discord.py**: Pycord is a maintained fork with growing adoption. `guides/01-sdk-selection.md` acknowledges the fork; defaults remain the Rapptz main-line unless the user specifies Pycord.

---

## Refresh cadence

- **Trigger immediately**: discord.js v15 reaches stable; Wavelink resumes maintenance (check `github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink`); Discord announces API v11.
- **Annual review**: Full `normal`-depth scripture-historian re-run.
- **Quarterly**: Skim `discord.com/developers/docs/change-log` for breaking changes.
