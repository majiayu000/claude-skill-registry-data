### Step 2: Voice Dimensions

**Define your voice on each spectrum:**

**Our position:** [1-5]

### Serious ←→ Playful

1 = Straightforward, no humor
5 = Witty, jokes, puns welcome

**Our position:** [1-5]
**Rationale:** [Why this fits your brand]

### Reserved ←→ Enthusiastic

5 = Exclamation points, emphatic language

5 = Plain language, accessible

**Our position:** [1-5]
**Rationale:** [Why this fits your brand]

### Respectful ←→ Irreverent

**Rationale:** [Why this fits your brand]
```

### Step 3: Core Voice Attributes

| Confident    | We know our stuff, no hedging | "This works." not "This might work."       |
| Approachable | Friendly, not corporate       | "Hey there" not "Dear valued customer"     |

## Validation

Before completing:

- [ ] Personality traits are specific, not generic
- [ ] Voice dimensions have clear positions
- [ ] Each attribute has do/don't examples
- [ ] Tone variations cover all content types
- [ ] Vocabulary lists are actionable
- [ ] Grammar rules are defined
- [ ] Messaging pillars have proof points
- [ ] Channel guidelines are specific

## Error Handling

- **Brand not clearly defined**: Start with personality questionnaire; ask about target audience and competitive positioning.
- **Voice too generic**: Push for specific adjectives; use "not X but Y" format (e.g., "not formal, but professional").
- **No existing content**: Create sample content in different tones for stakeholder feedback.
- **Conflicting input**: Identify primary audience; prioritize voice for them.
- **Too many attributes**: Limit to 3-4 core voice attributes; more becomes unmemorable.
