# Line Length Limits

Keep lines under 80-120 characters depending on team standards. Long lines are hard to read, especially in split-pane editors or during code review. Break long function calls across multiple lines. Extract long conditions into well-named variables. Configure your formatter to enforce line length. Exceptions can be made for URLs or generated code.
