description: Top-level orchestration skill for agentic SWMM modelling. Use when an agent needs one entrypoint that decides which module tools to run, in what order, and when to stop, for example to build, run, QA, and optionally calibrate a SWMM case from prepared or partially prepared inputs.

# SWMM End-to-End Orchestration

Part of [Agentic SWMM](https://github.com/Zhonghao1995/agentic-swmm-workflow) — install the project first for the executable toolchain (aiswmm CLI, SWMM solver, MCP servers).

## What this skill provides
- A top-level orchestration contract for the agent runtime.
- A stable handoff point for Agentic AI project memory in `memory/initial/`.
- A deterministic execution order across the existing module skills:
  - `swmm-canada` (entry skill for Canadian AOIs — real municipal pipes where covered, synthesized elsewhere in Canada)
  - `swmm-anywhere` (entry skill for data-scarce regions outside Canada — no real pipe data)
  - `swmm-gis`
  - `swmm-climate`
  - `swmm-params`
  - `swmm-network`
  - `swmm-builder`
  - `swmm-runner`
  - `swmm-design-review`
  - `swmm-plot`
  - `swmm-calibration`
  - `swmm-uncertainty`
  - `swmm-lid-optimization`
  - `swmm-experiment-audit`

## Routing rule — real-data path vs synth-data path

The orchestrator MUST inspect the user's inputs before choosing the entry skill:

- If the request includes any of `.shp`, `.csv`, `network.json`, a CAD file, or an existing `.inp` path → the user has real data; route to `swmm-network` (or `swmm-builder` if the INP is already prepared).
- If the request includes only a **bbox** or a **location name** with no pipe-network file attached → check the country first. For a **Canadian** AOI route to `swmm-canada` (the SWMMCanada upstream returns real published municipal storm pipes where a supported city covers the AOI, synthesized elsewhere in Canada). Outside Canada route to `swmm-anywhere`, which produces a synth `.inp`. Either way, downstream skills (`swmm-runner`, `swmm-experiment-audit`, `swmm-plot`) consume the result identically to a real-data INP.
- If both signals appear (bbox **and** a SHP) → prefer the real-data path (`swmm-network`); only fall back to `swmm-anywhere` if the user explicitly asks for a synth baseline for comparison.
- Clear stop conditions so the agent does not pretend a full model was built when critical inputs are still missing.
- A minimal real-data fallback path for Tod Creek via `scripts/real_cases/run_todcreek_minimal.py`.
- A mandatory audit handoff that consolidates artifacts, metrics, QA, comparison records, and default Obsidian audit notes after success or failure.

## When to use this skill
Use this skill when the user asks for:
- one agent-facing entrypoint for SWMM modelling,
- end-to-end build + run + QA,
- an agent to decide which SWMM module comes next,
- a real-data dry run before full automation is ready, or
- a bounded orchestration layer without rewriting the underlying scripts.

Do **not** use this skill when the user clearly wants only one module in isolation, such as only rainfall formatting or only calibration metrics.

## Recommended public memory preload
Before using this skill in Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes, or another compatible runtime, load the Markdown files in `memory/initial/`:

1. `identification_memory.md`
2. `soul.md`
3. `operational_memory.md`
4. `modeling_workflow_memory.md`
5. `evidence_memory.md`
6. `user_bridge_memory.md`

Those files define the public project identity, agent posture, evidence boundaries, and first-run user behavior. This skill remains the execution contract; the memory files should shape decisions and communication, not replace tool calls or depend on the maintainer's private local workspace.

## Supported operating modes
### Mode 0: MCP-first framework smoke test mode
Use this when the user is testing the Agentic SWMM framework itself, especially with prompts like "test the end-to-end framework", "test skill and MCP tool calls", "from raw data to INP", or "automatic modeling smoke test".

This mode tests orchestration behavior before scientific model quality. It must:
- trigger this `swmm-end-to-end` skill first;
- choose the smallest real-data subset that can exercise the chain;
- call the relevant MCP tool contracts as the primary path;
- Do not bypass MCP tool contracts by calling the underlying Python scripts as the primary path;
- use temporary script edits only for missing framework adapters that do not yet have MCP coverage;
- record every temporary script fallback as missing framework capability, not as a completed MCP feature.

The run manifest for this mode must include:
- `tool_transport`: `mcp` when the MCP server was called through the protocol, `script_fallback` when the tool contract exists but the MCP transport was bypassed, or `temporary_script` when no MCP contract exists yet;
- `mcp_tool_calls`: ordered records of the intended or actual tool calls, including server, tool name, input paths, output paths, and status;
- `missing_or_fallback_inputs`: explicit data gaps and assumptions such as missing soil, nonnumeric pipe diameter fallback, inferred outfall, inferred invert elevation, or shortened rainfall window;
- `framework_gaps`: MCP/skill gaps discovered during the run that should be implemented later.

Use `scripts/mcp_stdio_call.py` when Codex needs to verify the MCP transport directly from this repository. The helper initializes a server over stdio, checks `tools/list`, calls one tool with JSON arguments, and stores the raw MCP response as an artifact. Use repo-root relative paths in the JSON arguments; the helper resolves those to absolute paths before sending the tool call so server-local working directories do not corrupt path resolution.

For a raw-data to INP smoke test, prefer this MCP call order when inputs are present:
1. `swmm-gis-mcp.qgis_area_weighted_params` for land-use/soil area-weighted params, or record a missing-input fallback if soil is absent.
2. `swmm-climate-mcp.format_rainfall` for event rainfall.
3. `swmm-climate-mcp.build_raingage_section` when an explicit raingage artifact is needed.
4a. `swmm-network-mcp.prepare_storm_inputs` for raw municipal shapefiles (clip pipes + manholes to basin, fill mapping from `skills/swmm-network/templates/city_mapping_raw_shapefile.template.json`). Skip when the source is already a structured CAD export with explicit from/to nodes.
4b. `swmm-network-mcp.snap_pipe_endpoints` — heal sub-millimetre to centimetre vertex drift between adjacent pipe segments. Reasonable starting tolerance is 0.5–3 m. Reports clusters merged + any pipes dropped as self-loops.
4c. `swmm-network-mcp.infer_outfall` (mode `endpoint_nearest_watercourse` when a watercourse layer is available; else `lowest_endpoint`).
4d. `swmm-network-mcp.reorient_pipes` to BFS-flip flow direction.
4e. `swmm-network-mcp.import_city_network` to assemble `network.json`.
5. `swmm-network-mcp.qa`. With the 4a–4d steps above, `no_outfall_path` warnings should be limited to genuinely disconnected sub-graphs (e.g. trunk pipes that fall outside the basin clip).
5b. `swmm-network-mcp.assign_subcatchment_outlets` — REQUIRED when the subcatchments came out of `basin_shp_to_subcatchments` (which seeds every subcatchment's `outlet` to the literal outfall). This step rewrites each subcatchment's `outlet` to a real upstream junction (`mode=nearest_junction` reads `network.json`'s junctions list; or `mode=manual_lookup` for an explicit mapping). Without it the pipe network is in the .inp but receives no surface runoff. Pass the rewritten CSV (not the original) to `build_inp` in step 6.
6. `swmm-builder-mcp.build_inp`.
7. `swmm-runner-mcp.swmm_run`.
8. `swmm-runner-mcp.swmm_continuity`.
9. `swmm-runner-mcp.swmm_peak`.

Stop and report if a required MCP contract is absent. Continue with a temporary script only when the user explicitly asked to test the framework and the run manifest records the gap under `framework_gaps`.

### Mode A: Full modular build
Use this when the required explicit inputs already exist or can be produced safely:
- subcatchment polygons or builder-ready `subcatchments.csv`
- network input that can become `network.json`
- land use and soil inputs
- rainfall input

Execution order:
1. `swmm-gis`
2. `swmm-params`
3. `swmm-climate`
4. `swmm-network`
5. `swmm-builder`
6. `swmm-runner`
7. QA checks
8. `swmm-design-review` (reference-free plausibility review — no observed data needed)
9. optional `swmm-plot`
10. optional `swmm-calibration`
11. optional `swmm-uncertainty`
12. optional `swmm-lid-optimization`
13. `swmm-experiment-audit`
14. optional `swmm-report` (client Word deliverable; embeds any figures the run's plot stage holds, so plot before reporting when figures are wanted)

Exact MCP call chain for the full modular path. Two parallel branches
(GIS / hydrology vs network) merge at `build_inp`. Region-agnostic:
substitute the user's basin shapefile, pipe shapefile, watercourse
shapefile, landuse layer, soil layer, and rainfall input wherever the
inputs are referenced.

**GIS / hydrology branch (subcatchments + params)**
1. `swmm-gis-mcp.basin_shp_to_subcatchments` — basin shp → subcatchments.geojson + .csv. (Or `gis_preprocess_subcatchments` if a pre-attributed subcatchment shp + DEM exist.)
2. `swmm-gis-mcp.qgis_area_weighted_params` — intersect subcatchments × landuse × soil → weighted_params.json. Inspect the `warnings` array for any landuse classes that fell through to DEFAULT.
3. (alternative when a richer params chain is wanted) `swmm-params-mcp.map_landuse` → `map_soil` → `merge_params`.

**Climate branch (rainfall)**
4. `swmm-climate-mcp.format_rainfall` — rainfall CSV (or `.dat` via `inputDatPaths`) → rainfall.json + timeseries.txt.
5. `swmm-climate-mcp.build_raingage_section` (only when an explicit raingage artefact is needed).

**Network branch (pipe topology)**
6. `swmm-network-mcp.prepare_storm_inputs` — clip pipes (+optional manholes) shp to the basin, fill mapping.json from `templates/city_mapping_raw_shapefile.template.json`. (Skip when the source is already a structured CAD export with explicit from/to nodes.)
7. `swmm-network-mcp.snap_pipe_endpoints` — heal sub-millimetre vertex drift between pipe segments so `import_city_network` can infer connected junctions. (`BACKLOG.md B8`; skip pre-B8.)
8. `swmm-network-mcp.infer_outfall` — pick a single outfall point (mode `endpoint_nearest_watercourse` when a watercourse shp is available, else `lowest_endpoint`).
9. `swmm-network-mcp.reorient_pipes` — BFS-from-outfall flow-direction fix.
10. `swmm-network-mcp.import_city_network` — assemble network.json from the prepared geojsons + mapping.
11. `swmm-network-mcp.qa` — topology + required-attribute QA.

**Wiring + assembly**
12. `swmm-network-mcp.assign_subcatchment_outlets` — REQUIRED if subcatchments came from `basin_shp_to_subcatchments` (which writes `outlet=OUT1` as a placeholder). Rewrites the CSV so each subcatchment drains into a real upstream junction; without this the pipe network sits idle.
13. `swmm-builder-mcp.build_inp` — assemble model.inp + builder manifest.

**Run + QA + plot**
14. `swmm-runner-mcp.swmm_run` — omit the `node` arg to auto-detect the first `[OUTFALLS]` entry from the .inp.
15. `swmm-runner-mcp.swmm_continuity`
16. `swmm-runner-mcp.swmm_peak` — pass the actual outfall name explicitly (no longer defaults to `O1`).
16b. `aiswmm review --run-dir runs/<case> --rules skills/swmm-design-review/rulebooks/synth_plausibility.yaml` — reference-free plausibility review (no observed data); writes `11_review/design_review.json` + `.md`. Direct `review_run` tool / CLI verb, not an MCP server. Use the `synth_plausibility` rulebook for `swmm-anywhere` runs; use `gb50014_template` (or a local rulebook) for real-data design checks.
17. optional `swmm-plot-mcp.plot_rain_runoff_si` — paired rain + flow figure for any node.
14. optional calibration tools:
   - `swmm-calibration-mcp.swmm_sensitivity_scan`
   - `swmm-calibration-mcp.swmm_calibrate`
   - `swmm-calibration-mcp.swmm_calibrate_search`
   - `swmm-calibration-mcp.swmm_calibrate_sceua`
   - `swmm-calibration-mcp.swmm_calibrate_dream_zs`
   - `swmm-calibration-mcp.swmm_validate`
15. optional uncertainty / sensitivity analysis tools (use instead of or in addition to calibration):
   - `swmm-uncertainty-mcp.swmm_sensitivity_oat` — one-at-a-time sensitivity (parameter ranking)
   - `swmm-uncertainty-mcp.swmm_sensitivity_morris` — Morris elementary-effects screening
   - `swmm-uncertainty-mcp.swmm_sensitivity_sobol` — Sobol' first-order + total-effect indices
   - `swmm-uncertainty-mcp.swmm_uncertainty_source_decomposition` — integrate raw ensemble outputs
   - uncertainty **propagation** (hydrograph envelopes, not parameter ranking) has no MCP tool; use the scripts:
     - `python3 skills/swmm-uncertainty/scripts/uncertainty_propagate.py ...` (fuzzy alpha-cut)
     - `python3 skills/swmm-uncertainty/scripts/monte_carlo_propagate.py ...` (Monte Carlo)
16. optional LID scripts:
   - `python3 skills/swmm-lid-optimization/scripts/entropy_lid_priority.py ...`
   - `python3 skills/swmm-lid-optimization/scripts/lid_scenario_builder.py ...`
17. `swmm-experiment-audit` via CLI:
   - `aiswmm audit --run-dir runs/<case>` — canonical path; adds backup/MOC/memory-hook. Pass `--obsidian` to also copy the note to the local Obsidian vault.
   - `python3 skills/swmm-experiment-audit/scripts/audit_run.py --run-dir runs/<case>` — direct script path; Obsidian export is on by default (suppress with `--no-obsidian`).

### Mode B: Prepared-input build
Use this when `subcatchments.csv`, `network.json`, params JSON, and rainfall references already exist.

Execution order:
1. `swmm-builder`
2. `swmm-runner`
3. QA checks
4. `swmm-design-review` (reference-free plausibility review)
5. optional plotting / calibration
6. optional uncertainty / LID scenario analysis
7. `swmm-experiment-audit`

Exact MCP call chain for prepared inputs:
1. `swmm-builder-mcp.build_inp`
2. `swmm-runner-mcp.swmm_run`
3. `swmm-runner-mcp.swmm_continuity`
4. `swmm-runner-mcp.swmm_peak`
4b. `aiswmm review --run-dir runs/<case> [--rules <rulebook.yaml>]` — reference-free plausibility review; writes `11_review/`. Defaults to the `gb50014_template` rulebook; pass `--rules skills/swmm-design-review/rulebooks/synth_plausibility.yaml` for synthesized networks.
5. optional `swmm-plot-mcp.plot_rain_runoff_si`
6. optional calibration tools
7. optional uncertainty / LID scripts where a runnable base INP exists
8. `swmm-experiment-audit` via CLI:
   - `aiswmm audit --run-dir runs/<case>` — canonical path; adds backup/MOC/memory-hook. Pass `--obsidian` to also copy the note to the local Obsidian vault.
   - `python3 skills/swmm-experiment-audit/scripts/audit_run.py --run-dir runs/<case>` — direct script path; Obsidian export is on by default.

### Mode C: Minimal real-data Tod Creek fallback
Use this only when the user wants a real-data run but the full modular path is not ready because there is no trustworthy multi-subcatchment + network input yet.

Script:
- `scripts/real_cases/run_todcreek_minimal.py`

Audit command after the script returns:
- `aiswmm audit --run-dir runs/real-todcreek-minimal --workflow-mode "minimal real-data fallback"` — canonical path with backup/MOC/memory-hook.

Characteristics:
- one subcatchment
- simple junction/outfall/conduit layout
- real DEM / land use / soil / rainfall inputs
- useful as a real-data smoke test, not as the final watershed architecture

This fallback is a script path, not a module-MCP path.
The agent should choose it only when:
- the user explicitly accepts a simplified real-data smoke test, or
- full modular inputs are incomplete and the goal is to verify the repo can run with real data.

## Required decisions before execution
The orchestrator should decide these items explicitly:
- Are we doing a **full modular build** or a **minimal real-data fallback**?
- Do we already have `network.json` or equivalent network source files?
- Do we already have subcatchment polygons or builder-ready subcatchment CSV?
- Is the user asking for:
  - build only,
  - build + run + QA, or
  - build + run + QA + calibration / uncertainty / LID scenarios?

If the answer is unclear, prefer:
- build + run + QA
- no calibration
- full modular build only when required inputs are real and explicit

## Input completeness rules
### For full modular build
The run should stop and report missing inputs if any of these are absent:
- network information that can be converted to `network.json`
- subcatchment geometry or builder-ready subcatchment table
- rainfall input
- land use / soil inputs or an accepted pre-merged params artifact

### For minimal Tod Creek fallback
The run requires:
- `data/Todcreek/Geolayer/n48_w124_1arc_v3_Clip_Projec1.tif`
- `data/Todcreek/Geolayer/landuse.shp`
- `data/Todcreek/Geolayer/soil.shp`
- `data/Todcreek/Rainfall/1984rain.dat`
- `data/Todcreek/outlet_candidate.geojson`

## Execution policy
- Prefer existing module scripts and MCP tools over ad hoc one-off code.
- Keep every stage artifact under `runs/<case>/...` or another explicit run directory.
- Preserve machine-readable JSON outputs where available.
- Fail fast on missing critical inputs.
- Do not silently invent a drainage network for a supposed full build.
- If full modular inputs are incomplete but Tod Creek real-data fallback is available, say so explicitly and switch only if that matches the user’s intent.
- Always call `swmm-experiment-audit` after the attempt, even when the run fails or stops early. The audit record should reflect partial evidence rather than invent missing outputs.

## Artifact handoff contract
The top-level skill should pass artifacts between MCP tools using explicit run-local paths.

Recommended stage layout:
- `runs/<case>/01_gis/subcatchments.csv`
- `runs/<case>/01_gis/subcatchments.json`
- `runs/<case>/02_params/landuse.json`
- `runs/<case>/02_params/soil.json`
- `runs/<case>/02_params/merged_params.json`
- `runs/<case>/03_climate/rainfall.json`
- `runs/<case>/03_climate/timeseries.txt`
- `runs/<case>/03_climate/raingage.json`
- `runs/<case>/03_climate/raingage.txt`
- `runs/<case>/04_network/network.json`
- `runs/<case>/04_network/network_qa.json`
- `runs/<case>/05_builder/model.inp`
- `runs/<case>/05_builder/manifest.json`
- `runs/<case>/06_runner/model.rpt`
- `runs/<case>/06_runner/model.out`
- `runs/<case>/06_runner/manifest.json`
- `runs/<case>/07_qa/continuity.json`
- `runs/<case>/07_qa/peak.json`
- optional `runs/<case>/08_plot/...`
- optional `runs/<case>/09_calibration/...`
- optional `runs/<case>/09_uncertainty/...`
- optional `runs/<case>/09_lid/...`
- `runs/<case>/09_audit/experiment_provenance.json`
- `runs/<case>/09_audit/comparison.json`
- `runs/<case>/09_audit/experiment_note.md`

## Preflight
Before running any operating mode, every MCP server under `mcp/<server>/`
must have its `node_modules` installed. `node_modules/` is `.gitignored`,
so a fresh clone (or any server added later) needs an install step:

```bash
scripts/install_mcp_deps.sh                  # install for all mcp/*/ servers
scripts/install_mcp_deps.sh swmm-calibration # install for one server
```

The script loops over every `mcp/*/package.json` and runs `npm install`.
Exit code is non-zero if any install fails. Servers that fail to install
will not respond to `tools/list`, so a cold-start agent that skips this
step will see ambiguous "MCP server exited before response" errors deep
into Mode 0 instead of a clean install failure up front.

After install, verify with a `tools/list` probe per server, for example:

```bash
python3 skills/swmm-end-to-end/scripts/mcp_stdio_call.py \
  --server-dir mcp/swmm-calibration --tool __probe__ \
  --arguments-json '{}' --out-response /tmp/_.json
```

The harness will print the `Available tools: [...]` for that server in its
error output (a dedicated `--list-tools` flag is on the framework backlog).

## MCP execution notes
### GIS stage
- Use `gis_preprocess_subcatchments` only when a subcatchment polygon dataset already exists.
- Do not claim GIS preprocessing can replace watershed delineation or pipe-network generation.

### Params stage
- `map_landuse` and `map_soil` should target the same subcatchment ID universe.
- `merge_params` should be treated as the single params handoff into `build_inp`.

### Climate stage
- `format_rainfall` should create both JSON metadata and timeseries text.
- `build_raingage_section` should run after rainfall formatting so `series_name` or `rainfall_json` stays consistent.

### Network stage
- Use `import_network` only when raw conduits/junctions/outfalls exist.
- If `network.json` already exists, skip import and run `qa` directly.
- If no trustworthy network source exists, stop the full modular path.

### Builder stage
- `build_inp` is the only handoff into `swmm_run`.
- Treat builder validation failures as hard stops for the full modular path.

### Runner and QA stage
- `swmm_run` creates the canonical `manifest.json`.
- `swmm_continuity` and `swmm_peak` are mandatory QA steps, not optional metrics.
- Prefer the fixed `swmm_peak` parser path that reads the correct summary block.

### Calibration stage
- Do not enter calibration unless the user requested it or the workflow explicitly includes it.
- Require an observed flow file before any calibration tool is called.

### Audit stage
- Run `swmm-experiment-audit` after success, failure, or early stop.
- Use the run directory as the single audit input.
- Pass `--compare-to <baseline-run-dir>` when the user requests baseline/scenario or before/after comparison.
- The audit must write `09_audit/experiment_provenance.json`, `09_audit/comparison.json`, and Obsidian-compatible `09_audit/experiment_note.md` inside the run directory.
- The audit should also use the default Obsidian export unless the user explicitly asks for `--no-obsidian`.
- The default Obsidian vault is `~/Documents/Agentic-SWMM-Obsidian-Vault`, with `10_Memory_Layer` for durable lessons and `20_Audit_Layer` for run-level evidence.
- Do not include chat transcripts or conversational content in audit outputs.

## Agent prompt-level instruction
When an agent uses this skill, it should:
- choose one operating mode first,
- announce the chosen mode,
- create a case run directory,
- call only the MCP tools required for that mode,
- stop immediately on missing critical inputs instead of hallucinating replacements,
- call `swmm-experiment-audit` on the run directory,
- summarize which concrete artifacts and audit records were produced.

## QA gates
Minimum QA checks for a successful run:
- builder validation has no critical missing sections
- SWMM return code is zero
- `.rpt` and `.out` exist
- continuity metrics can be parsed
- peak metric can be parsed from the correct summary block

For calibration mode, also require:
- observed flow file parses successfully
- time overlap between observed and simulated series is adequate

## Output contract
At minimum, the orchestrator should leave behind:
- built `.inp`
- run `.rpt`
- run `.out`
- `manifest.json`
- a short machine-readable QA summary
- `11_review/design_review.json` + `11_review/design_review.md` (reference-free plausibility review)
- `09_audit/experiment_provenance.json`
- `09_audit/comparison.json`
- Obsidian-compatible `09_audit/experiment_note.md`

If plotting is requested, also produce:
- rainfall-runoff figure artifact

If calibration is requested, also produce:
- ranking / summary JSON
- chosen parameter set or best-params output

## Recommended agent behavior
- Use this skill as the **only top-level SWMM skill**.
- Treat module skills as subordinate implementation skills.
- Keep reasoning at the orchestration layer and calculations at the script layer.
- When a run fails, report the failing stage and the missing or invalid input rather than guessing.

## Known limitations
- This skill does not remove the need for `swmm-network`; it only coordinates it.
- Full watershed automation still depends on real subcatchment + network preparation.
- The Tod Creek real-data fallback is intentionally simplified and should not be confused with the final multi-subcatchment production workflow.
