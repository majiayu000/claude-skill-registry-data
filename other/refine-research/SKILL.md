# Research Refine: Problem-Anchored, Elegant, Frontier-Aware Plan Refinement

Refine and concretize: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Overview

Use this skill when the research problem is already visible but the technical route is still fuzzy. The goal is not to produce a bloated proposal or a benchmark shopping list. The goal is to turn a vague direction into a **problem -> focused method -> minimal validation** document that is concrete enough to implement, elegant enough to feel paper-worthy, and current enough to resonate in the foundation-model era.

Four principles dominate this skill:

1. **Do not lose the original problem.** Freeze an immutable **Problem Anchor** and reuse it in every round.
2. **The smallest adequate mechanism wins.** Prefer the minimal intervention that directly fixes the bottleneck.
3. **One paper, one dominant contribution.** Prefer one sharp thesis plus at most one supporting contribution.
4. **Modern leverage is a prior, not a decoration.** When LLM / VLM / Diffusion / RL / distillation / inference-time scaling naturally fit the bottleneck, use them concretely. Do not bolt them on as buzzwords.

```
User input (PROBLEM + vague APPROACH)
  -> Phase 0 (Claude): Freeze Problem Anchor
  -> Phase 1 (Claude): Scan grounding papers -> identify technical gap -> choose the sharpest route -> write focused proposal
  -> Phase 2 (Codex/GPT-5.4): Review for fidelity, specificity, contribution quality, and frontier leverage
  -> Phase 3 (Claude): Anchor check + simplicity check -> revise method -> rewrite full proposal
  -> Phase 4 (Codex, same thread): Re-evaluate revised proposal
  -> Repeat Phase 3-4 until OVERALL SCORE >= 9 or MAX_ROUNDS reached
  -> Phase 5: Save full history to output/refine-logs/
  -> Optional handoff: /experiment-plan for a detailed execution-ready experiment roadmap
```

## Constants

- **REVIEWER_MODEL = `gpt-5.4`** — Reviewer model used via Codex MCP.
- **MAX_ROUNDS = 5** — Maximum review-revise rounds.
- **SCORE_THRESHOLD = 9** — Minimum overall score to stop.
- **OUTPUT_DIR = `output/refine-logs/`** — Directory for round files and final report.
- **MAX_LOCAL_PAPERS = 15** — Maximum local papers/notes to scan for grounding.
- **MAX_CORE_EXPERIMENTS = 3** — Default cap for core validation blocks inside this skill.
- **MAX_PRIMARY_CLAIMS = 2** — Soft cap for paper-level claims. Prefer one dominant claim plus one supporting claim.
- **MAX_NEW_TRAINABLE_COMPONENTS = 2** — Soft cap for genuinely new trainable pieces. Exceed only if the paper breaks otherwise.

> Override via argument if needed, e.g. `/refine-research "problem | approach" -- max rounds: 3, threshold: 9`.

## State Persistence (Checkpoint Recovery)

Long-running refinement sessions may fail mid-way (e.g., API timeout, context compaction, or session interruption). To avoid losing completed work, persist state to `output/refine-logs/REFINE_STATE.json` after each phase boundary:

```json
{
  "phase": "review",
  "round": 1,
  "threadId": "019cd392-...",
  "last_score": 6.5,
  "last_verdict": "REVISE",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-22T20:00:00"
}
```

**Field definitions:**

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `phase` | `"anchor"` / `"proposal"` / `"review"` / `"refine"` / `"done"` | Last **completed** phase |
| `round` | 0–MAX_ROUNDS | Current round number |
| `threadId` | string or null | Reviewer thread ID for `codex-reply` continuity |
| `last_score` | number or null | Most recent overall score from reviewer |
| `last_verdict` | string or null | Most recent verdict (READY / REVISE / RETHINK) |
| `status` | `"in_progress"` / `"completed"` | Loop status |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 | When state was last written |

**Write rules:**
- **Write after each phase completes** (not before). Overwrite each time — only the latest state matters.
- **On completion** (Phase 5 finished), set `"status": "completed"`.

## Output Structure

```
output/refine-logs/
├── refine_state.json
├── round-0-initial-proposal.md
├── round-1-review.md
├── round-1-refinement.md
├── round-2-review.md
├── round-2-refinement.md
├── ...
├── final_proposal.md
├── refine_report.md
└── score-history.md
```

Every `round-N-refinement.md` must contain a **full anchored proposal**, not just incremental fixes.

## Workflow

### Initialization (Checkpoint Recovery)

Before starting any phase, check whether a previous run left a checkpoint:

1. **Check for `output/refine-logs/REFINE_STATE.json`**:
   - If it **does not exist** → **fresh start** (proceed to Phase 0 normally)
   - If it exists AND `status` is `"completed"` → **fresh start** (delete state file, previous run finished)
   - If it exists AND `status` is `"in_progress"` AND `timestamp` is **older than 24 hours** → **fresh start** (stale state from a killed/abandoned run — delete the file)
   - If it exists AND `status` is `"in_progress"` AND `timestamp` is **within 24 hours** → **resume**

2. **On resume**, read the state file and recover context:
   - Read all existing `output/refine-logs/round-*.md` files to restore prior work
   - Read `output/refine-logs/SCORE_HISTORY.md` if it exists
   - Recover `threadId` for reviewer thread continuity
   - Log to the user: `"Checkpoint found. Resuming after phase: {phase}, round: {round}."`
   - **Jump to the next phase** based on the saved `phase` value:

   | Saved `phase` | What was completed | Resume from |
   |---------------|-------------------|-------------|
   | `"anchor"` | Phase 0 done | Phase 1 (read anchor from round-0 context) |
   | `"proposal"` | Phase 1 done | Phase 2 (read `round-0-initial-proposal.md`) |
   | `"review"` | Phase 2 or 4 done | Phase 3 (read latest `round-N-review.md`) |
   | `"refine"` | Phase 3 done | Phase 4 (read latest `round-N-refinement.md`) |

3. **On fresh start**, ensure `output/refine-logs/` directory exists and proceed to Phase 0.

### Phase 0: Freeze the Problem Anchor

#### Step 0.1: Source the Input

Before extracting the anchor, decide what material is available:

- **Read `output/IDEA_REPORT.md`** (produced by `generate-idea`) if it exists.
- **Read `output/LIT_REVIEW_REPORT.md`** (produced by `lit-review`) if it exists.
- **If both exist**: use them as the primary source for problem framing, technical gap, and grounding literature. `$ARGUMENTS` is treated as an optional filter / pointer to which candidate idea to refine (if `IDEA_REPORT.md` contains multiple). **Steps 1.1 and 1.2 are skipped** — the gap and grounding material are already captured.
- **If only one exists**: read it and still skip the step it covers (IDEA_REPORT → covers Step 1.2; LIT_REVIEW_REPORT → covers Step 1.1). Perform the other step.
- **If neither exists**: focus on `$ARGUMENTS` as the sole input and run Phase 1 in full.

Record which source was used at the top of `ROUND_0_INITIAL_PROPOSAL.md`.

#### Step 0.2: Extract the Anchor

Before proposing anything, extract the user's immutable bottom-line problem. This anchor must be copied verbatim into every proposal and every refinement round.

Write:

- **Bottom-line problem**: What technical problem must be solved?
- **Must-solve bottleneck**: What specific weakness in current methods is unacceptable?
- **Non-goals**: What is explicitly *not* the goal of this project?
- **Constraints**: Compute, data, time, tooling, venue, deployment limits.
- **Success condition**: What evidence would make the user say "yes, this method addresses the actual problem"?

If later reviewer feedback would change the problem being solved, mark that as **drift** and push back or adapt carefully.

**Checkpoint:** Write `output/refine-logs/REFINE_STATE.json` with `{"phase": "anchor", "round": 0, "threadId": null, "last_score": null, "last_verdict": null, "status": "in_progress", "timestamp": "<now>"}`.

### Phase 1: Build the Initial Proposal

#### Step 1.1: Scan Grounding Material

**Skip this step if `output/LIT_REVIEW_REPORT.md` was read in Step 0.1** — its Synthesis section already provides grounding. Pull any additional details only if the review report is silent on a specific mechanism.

Check `papers/` first. Read only the relevant parts needed to answer:

- What mechanism do current methods use?
- Where exactly do they fail for this problem?
- What training objectives, representations, or interfaces are reusable?
- What details distinguish a real method from a renamed high-level idea?

If local material is insufficient, search recent top-venue/arXiv work online. Focus on **method sections, training setup, and failure modes**, not just abstracts.

#### Step 1.2: Identify the Technical Gap

**Skip this step if `output/IDEA_REPORT.md` was read in Step 0.1** — the selected idea already names the technical gap, bottleneck, and core claim. Lift them directly into the proposal (Method Thesis, Contribution Focus, Core Mechanism) and proceed to Step 1.3.

Do not stop at generic research questions. Make the gap operational:

1. **Current pipeline failure point**: where does the baseline break?
2. **Why naive fixes are insufficient**: larger context, more data, prompting, memory bank, or stacking more modules.
3. **Smallest adequate intervention**: what is the least additional mechanism that could plausibly fix the bottleneck?
4. **Frontier-native alternative**: is there a more current route using foundation-model-era primitives that better matches the bottleneck?
5. **Core technical claim**: what exact mechanism claim could survive top-venue scrutiny?
6. **Required evidence**: what minimum proof is needed to defend that claim?

#### Step 1.3: Choose the Sharpest Route

Before locking the method, compare two candidate routes if both are plausible:

- **Route A: Elegant minimal route** — the smallest mechanism that directly targets the bottleneck.
- **Route B: Frontier-native route** — a more modern route that uses Deep learning / LLM / VLM / Diffusion / RL / distillation / inference-time scaling *only if* it gives a cleaner or stronger story.

Then decide:

- Which route is more likely to become a strong paper under the stated constraints?
- Which route has the cleaner novelty story relative to the closest work?
- Which route avoids contribution sprawl?

If both routes are weak, rethink the framing instead of combining them into a larger system by default.

#### Step 1.4: Concretize the Method First

The proposal must answer "how would we actually build this?" Prefer method detail over broad experimentation and prefer reuse over invention.

Cover:

1. **One-sentence method thesis**: the single strongest mechanism claim.
2. **Contribution focus**: one dominant contribution and at most one supporting contribution.
3. **Complexity budget**: what is frozen or reused, what is new, and what tempting additions are intentionally excluded.
4. **System graph**: modules, data flow, inputs, outputs.
5. **Representation design**: what latent, embedding, plan token, reward signal, memory state, or alignment space is used?
6. **Training recipe**: data source, supervision, pseudo-labeling, negatives, curriculum, losses, weighting, stagewise vs joint training.
7. **Inference path**: how the trained components are used at test time and what signals flow where.
8. **Why the mechanism stays small**: why a larger stack is unnecessary.
9. **Exact role of any frontier primitive**: if you use an LLM / VLM / Diffusion / RL component, specify whether it acts as planner, teacher, critic, reward model, generator prior, search controller, or distillation source.
10. **Failure handling**: what could go wrong and what fallback or diagnostic exists?
11. **Novelty and elegance argument**: why this is more than naming a module and why the paper still looks focused.

If the method is still only described as "add a module" or "use a planner," it is not concrete enough.

#### Step 1.5: Design Minimal Claim-Driven Validation

Experiments exist to validate the method, not to dominate the document.

For each core claim, define the **smallest strong experiment** that can validate it. Every claim must be specified concretely enough that `/experiment-design` can turn it into a run plan without re-deriving scope.

Required fields per claim:

- **Claim statement** — the exact mechanism-level assertion
- **Anti-claim to rule out** — the alternative explanation a skeptical reviewer would reach for (e.g. "gain only comes from more parameters," "works only because of data leakage," "modern primitive is decorative")
- **Dataset / split / task** — named benchmark(s), splits, and the task formulation
- **Baseline family** — the single strongest comparison, plus the one ablation that isolates the contribution (avoid padded baseline lists)
- **Decisive metric** — the one metric that decides the claim; secondary metrics are optional
- **Success criterion** — the directional + magnitude outcome that would make the claim believable (e.g. "≥ 2 points on metric X under matched compute")
- **Failure interpretation** — what a negative result would mean for the paper
- **Stochastic variance handling** — seeds or confidence protocol if randomness matters
- **Compute envelope** — order-of-magnitude GPU-hours so the handoff is realistic

Additional rules:

- **Every claim must have an anti-claim.** Claims without an anti-claim cannot be experimentally isolated.
- Ensure one experiment block directly supports the **Problem Anchor** — mark it as the **anchor block**.
- If complexity risk exists, include one **simplification or deletion check** (compare final method against an overbuilt variant the paper intentionally rejects).
- If a frontier primitive is central, include one **necessity check** (compare the chosen primitive against the strongest plausible simpler or older alternative).
- Default to **1-3 core claims** and leave the full execution roadmap to `/experiment-design`.

#### Step 1.6: Write the Initial Proposal

Save to `output/refine-logs/ROUND_0_INITIAL_PROPOSAL.md`.

Use this structure:

```markdown

## Experiment Design Handoff

Everything `/experiment-design` needs to build the roadmap without re-deriving scope:

- **Anchor claim ID:**
- **Must-prove claims (ordered):**
- **Must-run ablations:**
- **Critical datasets / splits / metrics:**
- **Strongest baseline family per claim:**
- **Central frontier primitive (or "none"):**
- **Highest-risk assumptions:**
- **Hard constraints** (compute cap, data access, annotation limits, deadlines):
- **Nice-to-have vs must-run boundary:**

## Compute & Timeline Estimate
- Estimated GPU-hours:
- Data / annotation cost:
- Timeline:
```

**Checkpoint:** Update `output/refine-logs/REFINE_STATE.json` with `{"phase": "proposal", "round": 0, ...}`.

### Phase 2: External Method Review (Round 1)

Send the full proposal to GPT-5.4 for an **elegance-first, frontier-aware, method-first** review. The reviewer should spend most of the critique budget on the method itself, not on expanding the experiment menu.

```
mcp__codex__codex:
  model: REVIEWER_MODEL
  config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}
  prompt: |
    You are a senior ML reviewer for a top venue (NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR).
    This is an early-stage, method-first research proposal.

    Your job is NOT to reward extra modules, contribution sprawl, or a giant benchmark checklist.
    Your job IS to stress-test whether the proposed method:
    (1) still solves the original anchored problem,
    (2) is concrete enough to implement,
    (3) presents a focused, elegant contribution,
    (4) uses foundation-model-era techniques appropriately when they are the natural fit.

    Review principles:
    - Prefer the smallest adequate mechanism over a larger system.
    - Penalize parallel contributions that make the paper feel unfocused.
    - If a modern LLM / VLM / Diffusion / RL route would clearly produce a better paper, say so concretely.
    - If the proposal is already modern enough, do NOT force trendy components.
    - Do not ask for extra experiments unless they are needed to prove the core claims.

    Read the Problem Anchor first. If your suggested fix would change the problem being solved,
    call that out explicitly as drift instead of treating it as a normal revision request.

    === PROPOSAL ===
    [Paste the FULL proposal from Phase 1]
    === END PROPOSAL ===

    Score these 7 dimensions from 1-10:

    1. **Problem Fidelity**: Does the method still attack the original bottleneck, or has it drifted into solving something easier or different?

    2. **Method Specificity**: Are the interfaces, representations, losses, training stages, and inference path concrete enough that an engineer could start implementing?

    3. **Contribution Quality**: Is there one dominant mechanism-level contribution with real novelty, good parsimony, and no obvious contribution sprawl?

    4. **Frontier Leverage**: Does the proposal use current foundation-model-era primitives appropriately when they are the right tool, instead of defaulting to old-school module stacking?

    5. **Feasibility**: Can this method be trained and integrated with the stated resources and data assumptions?

    6. **Validation Focus**: Are the proposed experiments minimal but sufficient to validate the core claims? Is there unnecessary experimental bloat?

    7. **Venue Readiness**: If executed well, would the contribution feel sharp and timely enough for a top venue?

    **OVERALL SCORE** (1-10): Weighted toward Problem Fidelity, Method Specificity, Contribution Quality, and Frontier Leverage.
    Use this weighting: Problem Fidelity 15%, Method Specificity 25%, Contribution Quality 25%, Frontier Leverage 15%, Feasibility 10%, Validation Focus 5%, Venue Readiness 5%.

    For each dimension scoring < 7, provide:
    - The specific weakness
    - A concrete fix at the method level (interface / loss / training recipe / integration point / deletion of unnecessary parts)
    - Priority: CRITICAL / IMPORTANT / MINOR

    Then add:
    - **Simplification Opportunities**: 1-3 concrete ways to delete, merge, or reuse components while preserving the main claim. Write "NONE" if already tight.
    - **Modernization Opportunities**: 1-3 concrete ways to replace old-school pieces with more natural foundation-model-era primitives if genuinely better. Write "NONE" if already modern enough.
    - **Drift Warning**: "NONE" if the proposal still solves the anchored problem; otherwise explain the drift clearly.
    - **Verdict**: READY / REVISE / RETHINK

    Verdict rule:
    - READY: overall score >= 9, no meaningful drift, one focused dominant contribution, and no obvious complexity bloat remains
    - REVISE: the direction is promising but not yet at READY bar
    - RETHINK: the core mechanism or framing is still fundamentally off
```

**If the external reviewer model is not configured correctly, use Claude Code subagent instead.**

**CRITICAL: Save the `threadId`** from this call for all later rounds.

**CRITICAL: Save the FULL raw response** verbatim.

Save review to `output/refine-logs/ROUND_1_REVIEW.md` with the raw response in a `<details>` block.

**Checkpoint:** Update `output/refine-logs/REFINE_STATE.json` with `{"phase": "review", "round": 1, "threadId": "<saved>", "last_score": <parsed>, "last_verdict": "<parsed>", ...}`.

### Phase 3: Parse Feedback and Revise the Method

#### Step 3.1: Parse the Review

Extract:

- **Problem Fidelity**
- **Method Specificity**
- **Contribution Quality**
- **Frontier Leverage**
- **Feasibility**
- **Validation Focus**
- **Venue Readiness**
- **Overall score**
- **Verdict**
- **Drift Warning**
- **Simplification Opportunities**
- **Modernization Opportunities**
- **Action items** ranked by priority

Update `output/refine-logs/SCORE_HISTORY.md`:

```markdown
# Score Evolution

| Round | Problem Fidelity | Method Specificity | Contribution Quality | Frontier Leverage | Feasibility | Validation Focus | Venue Readiness | Overall | Verdict |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| 1     | X                | X                  | X                    | X                 | X           | X                | X               | X       | REVISE  |
```

**STOP CONDITION**: If overall score >= SCORE_THRESHOLD, verdict is READY, and there is no unresolved drift warning, skip to Phase 5.

#### Step 3.2: Revise With an Anchor Check and a Simplicity Check

Before changing anything:

1. Copy the **Problem Anchor verbatim**.
2. Write an **Anchor Check**:
   - What is the original bottleneck?
   - Does the current method still solve it?
   - Which reviewer suggestions would cause drift if followed blindly?
3. Write a **Simplicity Check**:
   - What is the dominant contribution now?
   - What components can be removed, merged, or kept frozen?
   - Which reviewer suggestions add unnecessary complexity?
   - If a frontier primitive is central, is its role still crisp and justified?

Then process reviewer feedback:

- If **valid**: sharpen the mechanism, simplify if possible, or modernize if the paper really improves.
- If **debatable**: revise, but explain your reasoning with evidence.
- If **wrong, drifting, or over-complicating**: push back with evidence from local papers and the Problem Anchor.

Bias the revisions toward:

- a sharper central contribution
- fewer moving parts
- cleaner reuse of strong existing backbones
- more natural foundation-model-era leverage when it improves the paper
- leaner, claim-driven experiments

Do **not** add multiple parallel contributions just to chase score. If the reviewer requests another module, first ask whether the same gain can come from a better interface, distillation signal, reward model, or inference policy on top of an existing backbone.

Save to `output/refine-logs/ROUND_N_REFINEMENT.md`:

```markdown
# Round N Refinement

## Problem Anchor
[Copy verbatim from round 0]

## Anchor Check
- Original bottleneck:
- Why the revised method still addresses it:
- Reviewer suggestions rejected as drift:

## Simplicity Check
- Dominant contribution after revision:
- Components removed or merged:
- Reviewer suggestions rejected as unnecessary complexity:
- Why the remaining mechanism is still the smallest adequate route:

## Changes Made

### 1. [Method section changed]

### 2. [Novelty / modernity / feasibility / validation change]
- Reviewer said:
- Action:
- Reasoning:

## Revised Proposal
[Full updated proposal from Problem Anchor through Claim-Driven Validation Sketch **and** the Experiment Design Handoff block. Every claim must still carry: anti-claim, dataset/split/task, baseline family, decisive metric, success criterion, failure interpretation. Do not drop these fields when revising.]
```

**Checkpoint:** Update `output/refine-logs/REFINE_STATE.json` with `{"phase": "refine", "round": N, ...}`.

### Phase 4: Re-evaluation (Round 2+)

Send the revised proposal back to GPT-5.4 in the **same thread**:

```
mcp__codex__codex-reply:
  threadId: [saved from Phase 2]
  model: REVIEWER_MODEL
  config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}
  prompt: |
    [Round N re-evaluation]

    I revised the proposal based on your feedback.
    First, check whether the original Problem Anchor is still preserved.
    Second, judge whether the method is now more concrete, more focused, and more current.

    Key changes:
    1. [Method change 1]
    2. [Method change 2]
    3. [Simplification / modernization / pushback if any]

    === REVISED PROPOSAL ===
    [Paste the FULL revised proposal]
    === END REVISED PROPOSAL ===

    Please:
    - Re-score the same 7 dimensions and overall
    - State whether the Problem Anchor is preserved or drifted
    - State whether the dominant contribution is now sharper or still too broad
    - State whether the method is simpler or still overbuilt
    - State whether the frontier leverage is now appropriate or still old-school / forced
    - Focus new critiques on missing mechanism, weak training signal, weak integration point, pseudo-novelty, or unnecessary complexity
    - Use the same verdict rule: READY only if overall score >= 9 and no blocking issue remains

    Same output format: 7 scores, overall score, verdict, drift warning, simplification opportunities, modernization opportunities, remaining action items.
```

Save review to `output/refine-logs/ROUND_N_REVIEW.md`.

**Checkpoint:** Update `output/refine-logs/REFINE_STATE.json` with `{"phase": "review", "round": N, "threadId": "<saved>", "last_score": <parsed>, "last_verdict": "<parsed>", ...}`.

Then return to Phase 3 until:

- **Overall score >= SCORE_THRESHOLD** and verdict is READY and no unresolved drift
- or **MAX_ROUNDS reached**

### Phase 5: Final Report and Logs

#### Step 5.1: Write `output/refine-logs/FINAL_PROPOSAL.md`

This file is the clean, experiment-design-ready version of the proposal. It should contain **no review chatter, no round history, no raw reviewer output** — only the final method and the information `/experiment-design` needs to build a claim-driven roadmap.

**Readiness gate**: before saving, verify every section below has content. If any of these are blank, the handoff will fail:
- Problem Anchor (bottleneck + success condition)
- Method thesis + dominant contribution
- System overview + core mechanism + training/inference recipe
- Each claim has: anti-claim, dataset, baseline family, decisive metric, success criterion, failure interpretation
- At least one anchor claim is tagged
- Experiment Design Handoff section is fully populated

## Experiment Design Handoff

This section is the contract `/experiment-design` will consume. Keep it self-contained.

- **Anchor claim ID:** C1
- **Must-prove claims (ordered by priority):**
- **Must-run ablations:**
- **Critical datasets / splits / metrics:**
- **Strongest baseline family per claim:**
- **Central frontier primitive (or "none"):**
- **Highest-risk assumptions (things that could invalidate the plan):**
- **Hard constraints:**
  - Compute cap:
  - Data access / licensing:
  - Annotation or human-eval limits:
  - Deadlines / venue targets:
- **Must-run vs nice-to-have boundary:**
- **Known evaluation pitfalls to avoid** (leakage, metric mismatch, unmatched compute, train-test overlap):

## Compute & Timeline Estimate
- Estimated total GPU-hours (main method + baselines + ablations):
- Data / annotation cost:
- Timeline (weeks to each milestone):
- Biggest bottleneck:

If the final verdict is not READY, still write the best current final version here and leave `Open Weaknesses` frank — `/experiment-design` needs to know what is shaky.

#### Step 5.2: Write `output/refine-logs/REFINE_REPORT.md`

This is the single consolidated report. It merges the round-by-round review record, the refinement summary, and the drift/pushback log that previously lived in a separate `REVIEW_SUMMARY.md`.

## Overall Evolution
- [How the method became more concrete]
- [How the dominant contribution became more focused]
- [How unnecessary complexity was removed]
- [How modern technical leverage improved or stayed intentionally minimal]
- [How drift was avoided or corrected]

## Final Status
- Anchor status: [preserved / corrected / unresolved]
- Focus status: [tight / slightly broad / still diffuse]
- Modernity status: [appropriately frontier-aware / intentionally conservative / still old-school]
- Strongest parts of final method:
- Remaining weaknesses:

## Next Steps
- If READY: proceed to `/experiment-design` for a full experiment roadmap, then `/deploy-experiment`
- If REVISE: manually address the remaining mechanism weaknesses, then re-run `/refine-research`
- If RETHINK: revisit the core mechanism, possibly with `/generate-idea`

**Checkpoint:** Update `output/refine-logs/REFINE_STATE.json` with `{"phase": "done", "status": "completed", ...}`.

## Key Rules

- **Large file handling**: If the Write tool fails due to file size, immediately retry using Bash (`cat << 'EOF' > file`) to write in chunks. Do NOT ask the user for permission — just do it silently.

- **Anchor first, every round.** Always carry forward the same Problem Anchor.
- **One paper, one dominant contribution.** Avoid multiple parallel contributions unless the paper truly needs them.
- **The smallest adequate mechanism wins.** Bigger is not automatically better.
- **Prefer reuse over invention.** Start from strong existing backbones and add only what the bottleneck requires.
- **Modern techniques are a prior, not a decoration.** Use LLM / VLM / Diffusion / RL-era components when they sharpen the method, not when they only make the proposal sound trendy.
- **Minimal experiments, maximal specificity.** Inside this skill, experiments only need to prove the core claims — but each claim must carry anti-claim, dataset, baseline family, decisive metric, success criterion, and failure interpretation so `/experiment-design` can build the roadmap without re-deriving scope.
- **Handoff is a hard gate.** `FINAL_PROPOSAL.md` must include a fully populated Experiment Design Handoff section. A proposal that cannot be handed off has not actually been refined.
- **Review the mechanism, not the parts count.** A long module list is not novelty.
- **Pushback is encouraged.** If reviewer feedback causes drift or unnecessary complexity, argue back with evidence.
- **ALWAYS use `config: {"model_reasoning_effort": "xhigh"}`** for all Codex review calls.
- **Save `threadId` from Phase 2** and use `mcp__codex__codex-reply` for later rounds.
- **Do not fabricate results.** Only describe expected evidence and planned experiments.
- **Be specific about compute and data assumptions.** Vague "we'll train a model" is not enough.
- **Document everything.** Save every raw review, every anchor check, every simplicity check, and every major method change.

## Composing with Other Skills

This skill sits between idea discovery and execution:

```
/experiment-design-pipeline              -> one-shot refine + experiment planning
/generate-idea "direction/topic"       -> candidate ideas
/refine-research "PROBLEM: ... | APPROACH: ..."  <- you are here
/experiment-design                -> detailed experiment roadmap
/deploy-experiment                 -> execute the chosen method
/auto-review-loop               -> iterate on results and paper
```

Typical flow:

1. `/generate-idea` or local reading gives you a problem and a vague method direction
2. `/refine-research` turns that into an anchored, elegant, frontier-aware method plan
3. `/experiment-design` turns the final proposal into a detailed claim-driven experiment roadmap
4. `/experiment-design-pipeline` is the one-shot wrapper when the user wants both stages in a single request
5. `/deploy-experiment` executes the chosen runs
6. Later loops operate on results, not just ideas

This skill also works standalone if you already know the problem and just need the method to become concrete.
