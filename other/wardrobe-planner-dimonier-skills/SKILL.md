# Wardrobe Planner

This skill provides a systematic 7-stage methodology for organizing wardrobe and closet spaces, based on First Principles Framework (FPF). The approach emphasizes observation over assumption, testing over guessing, and continuous improvement over one-time fixes.

## The 7-Stage Process

### Stage 1: OBSERVATION (Understand Reality)

**Actions:**

1. **Inventory contents** - Remove EVERYTHING from the closet, sort by categories (clothing, shoes, accessories, seasonal items)
2. **Measure space** - Record height, width, depth of the closet; note obstacles (pipes, outlets, structural elements)
3. **Analyze usage patterns** - Identify what you access daily, weekly, seasonally
4. **Document current problems** - Write down what doesn't work (doesn't fit, hard to reach, gets wrinkled)

**Stage outcome:** Complete item list, accurate dimensions, and clear understanding of current issues.

### Stage 2: HYPOTHESIS GENERATION (Generate Options)

**Actions:**

1. **Create 3-5 organization variants** without judging their quality:
   - Option A: Shelves + hanging rods + pull-out drawers
   - Option B: Modular containers + hanging rods
   - Option C: Combination of ready-made storage systems
   - etc.

2. **For each variant, sketch out**:
   - Which zones will exist (everyday clothing, seasonal, shoes, accessories)
   - Which elements are needed (rods, shelves, drawers, baskets, hooks)
   - Approximate cost

**Stage outcome:** Several draft concepts without evaluation.

### Stage 3: ANALYSIS (Check Logic)

**Actions:**

1. **For each variant, ask questions**:
   - Will everything fit? (verify mathematically: volume of items ≤ volume of closet)
   - Is daily-use clothing easily accessible?
   - Is ergonomics considered? (eye level = frequently used, top/bottom = rarely used)
   - Does it fit the budget?
   - Can you implement it yourself?

2. **Identify contradictions and risks**:
   - "This option requires drilling into load-bearing walls"
   - "Shoe ventilation isn't accounted for here"
   - "Door placement will interfere with access"

**Stage outcome:** Unrealistic options eliminated, 1-2 finalists with clear pros and cons.

### Stage 4: PRACTICAL TESTING (Prototype)

**Actions:**

1. **Create a prototype of the chosen option**:
   - Mark zones with painter's tape on closet walls
   - Use temporary solutions (boxes instead of containers, rope instead of rod)
   - Live with this prototype for 3-7 days

2. **Gather facts**:
   - Time typical actions (find a shirt, get sneakers)
   - Document inconveniences ("need to remove three boxes to reach the fourth")
   - Note what didn't fit or what space remains unused

3. **Adjust the plan** based on reality

**Stage outcome:** Life-tested final plan accounting for real-world surprises.

### Stage 5: IMPLEMENTATION (Sequential Execution)

**Clear separation:**

#### 5.1 WHAT IS NEEDED (Requirements)
- Zone for 20 hangers of everyday clothing at 140-170 cm height
- Shoe shelf for 10 pairs, accessible without bending
- Closed containers for seasonal items

#### 5.2 HOW TO DO IT (Instructions)
- **Step 1:** Install rod at 165 cm height, 80 cm length
- **Step 2:** Mount shoe shelf at 90 cm height
- **Step 3:** Place containers on upper shelf (200+ cm)
- **Tools:** drill, level, anchors
- **Materials:** chrome-plated rod 80cm, chipboard shelf 80x30 cm, containers 40x30x20 cm

#### 5.3 WHAT WAS DONE (Action Log)
- Jan 23, 2026, 14:00-15:30: Rod installed, required 4 anchors, hung 18 hangers. Slight sag - add third mounting point.
- Jan 23, 2026, 16:00-16:45: Shoe shelf secured, fits 12 pairs (more than planned).

**Key rule:** Do NOT proceed to the next step until the previous one is completed and documented.

### Stage 6: RESULT VERIFICATION (Audit)

**Actions:**

1. **Check against requirements** from section 5.1:
   - ✅ Zone for 20 hangers present? → Yes, holds 18, room for 2 more
   - ✅ Shelf for 10 pairs of shoes? → Yes, fits 12
   - ✅ Containers for seasonal items? → Yes, 4 containers on upper shelf

2. **Measure effectiveness**:
   - Time to assemble an outfit: was 5 minutes → now 2 minutes
   - Amount of forgotten items: was ~20% → now ~5%

3. **Document deviations**:
   - "Rod sagged → added third mounting point"
   - "Containers too deep → replaced with shallower ones"

**Stage outcome:** Verified solution with documented results and adjustments.

### Stage 7: EVOLUTION (Continuous Improvement)

**Ongoing cycle:**

- After 1 month: Assess what's not working, what can be improved
- After 3 months: Check if new items require zone redistribution
- With season change: Redistribute zones (winter items accessible, summer items up top)

## Key Principles

1. **Separate facts from opinions**
   - Fact: "I have 47 hangers"
   - Opinion: "I need a lot of space for clothing"

2. **Don't confuse "plan" and "reality"**
   - Plan: "Rod will support 30 kg"
   - Reality: "Rod sagged at 20 kg" → adjust plan

3. **Clearly define element roles**
   - Rod is NOT for storing shoes (even if technically possible)
   - Upper shelves are NOT for daily items (inconvenient to reach)

4. **Everything must be verifiable**
   - Not "comfortable closet", but "outfit assembly time < 3 minutes"
   - Not "lots of space", but "holds 50 hangers + 15 pairs of shoes"

5. **Act sequentially**
   - First main zones, then small details
   - First testing, then buying expensive solutions

## Summary

This is the FPF approach without jargon: systematically observe → creatively generate options → logically verify → practically test → carefully implement → honestly evaluate → continuously improve.
