## Writing Tips

### Voiceover Best Practices

1. **Write for the ear**: Use conversational language
2. **Short sentences**: 15-20 words max per sentence
3. **Active voice**: "The company launched" not "was launched by"
4. **Present tense**: Creates immediacy
5. **Read aloud**: Test if it sounds natural
6. **Pause points**: Use "..." for natural breathing pauses

### Hook Formulas

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Curiosity | "What if I told you..." |
| Stakes | "This could change everything about..." |
| Contrast | "Everyone thought X, but actually..." |
| Question | "Have you ever wondered why..." |
| Bold claim | "This is the biggest {thing} since..." |

### Pacing Guidelines

| Section | % of Video | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Hook | 5-10% | Grab attention |
| Context | 15-20% | Set up understanding |
| Main content | 50-60% | Deliver value |
| Implications | 10-15% | Make it relevant |
| CTA | 5-10% | Drive action |

## Word Count to Duration

| Words | Approx. Duration |
|-------|------------------|
| 50 | 15 seconds |
| 100 | 30 seconds |
| 150 | 45 seconds |
| 200 | 60 seconds |
| 300 | 90 seconds |
| 400 | 2 minutes |

Speaking pace: ~150 words per minute
