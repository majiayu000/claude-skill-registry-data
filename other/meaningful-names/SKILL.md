# Meaningful Names

Use intention-revealing names that explain what a variable holds or what a function does. Avoid single-letter variables (except loop counters), abbreviations, and cryptic names. Function names should be verbs or verb phrases (getUserById, calculateTax). Class names should be nouns. The name length should be proportional to its scope—broader scope requires more descriptive names.
