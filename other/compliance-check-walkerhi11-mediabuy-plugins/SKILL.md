# Compliance Check

Review creative for regulatory and platform compliance.

## Process

### Step 1: Check FTC Disclosure Requirements

**Required Disclosures:**
- Material connections (paid/sponsored)
- Affiliate relationships
- Typical results (if showing testimonials)
- Paid endorsements

**Disclosure Placement:**
- Must be clear and conspicuous
- Close to the claim
- Same format as claim (video = video disclosure)
- Mobile-readable size

**Common FTC Issues:**
- Hidden disclosures in fine print
- Disclosures that require scrolling
- "Results not typical" buried at end
- Influencer posts without #ad

### Step 2: Verify Platform Policy Compliance

**Facebook/Meta Policies:**
- No before/after images implying unrealistic results
- No personal attributes targeting ("Are you overweight?")
- No misleading claims
- No prohibited content (weapons, adult, etc.)
- Landing page must match ad claims

**TikTok Policies:**
- Similar to Meta plus TikTok-specific rules
- Authenticity requirements
- No misleading information

**Google/YouTube Policies:**
- Healthcare restrictions
- Financial service requirements
- Destination requirements

**Native Ad Policies:**
- Varies by network
- Generally stricter on health claims
- Editorial-style requirements

### Step 3: Flag Restricted Claims

**Health Claims:**
- Disease treatment/cure claims
- Drug-like claims
- Specific medical outcomes
- "Clinically proven" without evidence

**Financial Claims:**
- Income guarantees
- "Get rich quick" implications
- Investment returns promises

**Before/After:**
- Unrealistic transformations
- Implied guaranteed results
- Time-specific promises

**Testimonials:**
- Atypical results presented as typical
- Fake reviews/testimonials
- Undisclosed paid testimonials

### Step 4: Suggest Compliant Alternatives

**Reframing Techniques:**
- "May help support..." vs "Cures..."
- "Users reported..." vs "You will..."
- "Individual results vary" disclaimer
- Opinion-based language

**Safe Phrasing:**
| Problematic | Compliant Alternative |
|-------------|----------------------|
| "Lose 30 lbs in 30 days" | "Supports healthy weight management" |
| "Cures diabetes" | "Supports healthy blood sugar levels" |
| "Make $10K/month" | "Income potential varies" |
| "Guaranteed results" | "Results may vary" |
