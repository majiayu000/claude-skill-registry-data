# Web Search Research

Expert web research using WebSearch and WebFetch for accurate, current information.

## Quick Reference

- **[Strategies](strategies.md)** - Query-type-specific search approaches
- **[Progressive Search](progressive.md)** - Time-boxed research rounds
- **[Synthesis Format](synthesis.md)** - Organizing findings
- **[Quality Guidelines](quality.md)** - Research best practices

## When to Use

- Find modern information not in training data
- Locate official documentation for APIs/libraries
- Research best practices and current recommendations
- Discover technical solutions to specific problems
- Compare technologies, approaches, or tools

## Date Context Awareness

**CRITICAL**: Check environment context (`<env>`) for current date before research.

**Why**: Ensures searches use current year, prevents outdated best practices.

## Core Process

1. **Analyze** - Break down query, identify key terms
2. **Search** - Execute strategic searches
3. **Fetch** - Retrieve content from authoritative sources
4. **Synthesize** - Organize and present findings

## Research Depth

| Level | Time | Use When |
|-------|------|----------|
| Quick | 15-20 min | Simple questions, checking syntax |
| Standard | 30-45 min | Technical decisions, best practices |
| Deep | 60-90 min | Architecture decisions, critical systems |
| Exhaustive | 2+ hr | Mission-critical, novel domains |

See **[strategies.md](strategies.md)** for API/docs/best-practices search patterns and **[progressive.md](progressive.md)** for time-boxed approach.
