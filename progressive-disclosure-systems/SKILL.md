# Progressive Disclosure Systems (React 18)

## Summary

Design progressive disclosure UIs that reveal data and components in optimal sequences.

## Key Capabilities

- Orchestrate staged reveals with `Suspense` and transitions.
- Optimize perceived performance with incremental loading.
- Maintain UX continuity under partial data availability.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Model user attention as a function of reveal order.
- Optimize reveal sequences using empirical engagement metrics.
- Validate that progressive disclosure reduces cognitive load.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Demonstrate a staged reveal flow with measurable UX gains.
- Provide a rationale for sequencing decisions.
- Document fallback behavior under missing data.
