# Persona Intelligence Cards Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing discovery/interview style calls with multiple personas.
- Equipping teams with quick reference for executive, technical, or procurement stakeholders.
- Updating messaging blocks ahead of launches or new industries.

## Framework
1. **Persona Snapshot** – role, priorities, KPIs, success metrics.
2. **Pain/Gain Map** – common challenges, desired outcomes, current initiatives.
3. **Questions & Triggers** – discovery prompts, red flags, buying signals.
4. **Proof & Stories** – tailored case studies, metrics, references.
5. **Objection Handling** – typical concerns and recommended responses.

## Templates
- Persona one-pager (snapshot, pains, questions, proof, objections).
- Discovery cheat sheet for multi-threaded calls.
- Exec briefing note (headline, outcome, ask).

## Tips
- Keep snapshots updated quarterly with new customer evidence.
- Highlight deal-specific context (competitor, product, region) for better adoption.
- Pair with `call-brief-framework` to slot persona notes directly into call briefs.
