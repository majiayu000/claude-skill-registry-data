# Custom Content Template Manager

Create and manage custom content type templates beyond the 8 built-in types (article, blog, whitepaper, faq, research-paper, video-script, case-study, newsletter). Define section structure, word count ranges, readability targets, citation requirements, and quality standards — then use the template with `/contentforge:create-content` for consistent, repeatable content production.

## Where templates live

- **Built-in templates (read-only):** `templates/content-types/` inside the installed plugin — article, blog, whitepaper, faq, research-paper, video-script, case-study, newsletter.
- **Custom templates (user-created):** `~/.claude-marketing/_templates/` — **never** write into the installed plugin directory. Plugin updates and reinstalls wipe the plugin folder; anything saved there is lost. `~/.claude-marketing/_templates/` survives updates.

## When to Use

Use `/contentforge:cf-template` when:
- You need a **content type not covered** by the 8 built-in templates (product comparison, landing page copy, press release, webinar outline, etc.)
- You want to **standardize a content format** your team produces regularly
- You need to **modify an existing template** (e.g., add a section to the article template)
- You're onboarding a client who has **specific content format requirements**
- You want to **import a content structure** from an example file

**For producing content using a template**, use `/contentforge:create-content --type=custom:template-name`.
**For the 8 built-in templates**, see `templates/content-types/` (these ship with the plugin and cannot be deleted).

## What This Command Does

1. **Define Template** — Specify content type name, base type (or custom), word count range, readability target, and citation requirements
2. **Create Section Structure** — Define sections with names, descriptions, word count allocations, and ordering
3. **Set Quality Standards** — Readability target (grade level), citation density, keyword placement rules, and custom quality criteria
4. **Generate Template File** — Create the template .md file in `~/.claude-marketing/_templates/`
5. **Validate Pipeline Compatibility** — Test that the template works with all ContentForge pipeline phases

## Required Inputs

**Minimum Required:**
- **Template Name** — Name for the custom template (e.g., "case-study", "product-comparison", "email-newsletter")

**Optional:**
- **Base Type** — Start from an existing template and modify: article, blog, whitepaper, faq, research-paper, video-script, case-study, newsletter, or `custom` (blank slate)
- **Word Count Range** — Minimum and maximum word count (e.g., 1500-2500)
- **Readability Target** — Flesch-Kincaid grade level target (e.g., 8-10 for general, 12-14 for professional)
- **Citation Minimum** — Minimum number of citations required (e.g., 5)
- **Section Structure** — Array of section names with descriptions and word count allocations

## How to Use

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```
/contentforge:cf-template
```
**Prompts you for:**
1. Template name
2. Base type (or custom)
3. Word count range
4. Readability target
5. Citation minimum
6. Sections (add one at a time, or import from example)

### Quick Mode
```
/contentforge:cf-template case-study --base=article --words=1500-2500 --readability=10-12 --citations=8
```

### Import from Example File
```
/contentforge:cf-template product-comparison --from-example=./example-product-comparison.docx
```
Analyzes the example file's structure (headings, sections, word count) and creates a template matching that format.

### Modify Existing Template
```
/contentforge:cf-template article --modify --add-section="Expert Quotes:Include 3-5 expert quotes with attribution:200-300"
```

### List All Templates
```
/contentforge:cf-template --list
```
Shows built-in and custom templates with key specifications.

## What Happens

### Step 1: Template Definition (1-2 minutes)

Define the template's core specifications.

**From Base Type:**
- Load the base template's structure and specifications
- Allow modifications (add/remove/reorder sections, change word counts, adjust quality standards)

**From Example File:**
- Parse the example document's heading structure (H1/H2/H3)
- Measure word counts per section
- Identify citation patterns
- Generate a template matching the observed structure

**From Custom (Blank Slate):**
- Start with no predefined structure
- User defines every section from scratch

**Example:**
```
Template Definition

  + Added "Solution Implementation" section
  + Added "Results & Metrics" section
  + Added "Client Quote" section
  - Removed generic "Background" section
  * Changed conclusion to "Key Takeaways + CTA"

## Troubleshooting

### "Word counts don't sum to range"
**Cause:** Section word count allocations don't add up to the template's total word count range.
**Solution:** Adjust individual section word counts or the template's total range. The template creator will warn you during definition if allocations are mismatched.

### "Pipeline validation failed at Phase 7"
**Cause:** Quality standards are too strict or conflicting (e.g., Grade 7 readability with 25 citations — low readability + high citation density is hard to achieve).
**Solution:** Relax either the readability target or the citation minimum. The validation will suggest which constraint to adjust.

### "Template not found when using --type=custom:name"
**Cause:** Template file doesn't exist in `~/.claude-marketing/_templates/` (custom) or `templates/content-types/` (built-in), or the name doesn't match.
**Solution:** Run `/contentforge:cf-template --list` to see available templates. Names are kebab-case (e.g., `case-study`, not `Case Study`). Custom templates created before mid-2026 may still sit inside the old plugin-directory location — if so, move them to `~/.claude-marketing/_templates/` so plugin updates don't delete them.

### "Can't modify built-in template"
**Cause:** Built-in templates (article, blog, whitepaper, faq, research-paper, video-script, case-study, newsletter) are read-only.
**Solution:** Create a custom template based on the built-in one: `/contentforge:cf-template my-article --base=article`. This creates a copy you can modify freely.

## Limitations

- **Custom templates** live at `~/.claude-marketing/_templates/` on this machine (not synced to cloud unless exported)
- **Base type modification** copies the base — changes to the base later won't propagate to the custom template
- **Maximum sections**: 15 per template (more than 15 makes the pipeline unwieldy)
- **Minimum word count**: 300 words (below this, the quality scoring system is unreliable)
- **Import from example** works best with well-structured .docx files (clear heading hierarchy)

## Agent Used

None. This skill uses deterministic template creation (section definition, word count calculation, validation rules) without agent-based reasoning.
