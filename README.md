# Claude Skill Registry (Data)

This repo contains the **archived skill contents** (the heavy, browsable skill files).

**Canonical layout**
- Category folders at repo root (e.g. `data/`, `development/`, `devops/`, …)
- Each skill lives under a category: `data/<skill>/SKILL.md` + `data/<skill>/metadata.json`

**Legacy layout (still present)**
- Some skills also exist at the repo root (e.g. `<skill>/SKILL.md`).  
  These are **legacy copies** and will be cleaned up. Use the category folders as the source of truth.

**Where the index + site live**
- Core repo: https://github.com/majiayu000/claude-skill-registry-core
