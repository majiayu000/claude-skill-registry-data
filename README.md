# Claude Skill Registry (Data)

This repo contains the **archived skill contents** (the heavy, browsable skill files).

**Canonical layout**
- Category folders at repo root (e.g. `data/`, `development/`, `devops/`, …)
- Each skill lives under a category: `data/<skill>/SKILL.md` + `data/<skill>/metadata.json`

**Legacy layout**
- Root-level duplicate skill copies were removed on **2026‑02‑05**.  
  If any appear again, treat them as stale and move into a category folder.

**Archive size**
- **74,213** `SKILL.md` files (as of 2026‑02‑05)

**Where the index + site live**
- Core repo: https://github.com/majiayu000/claude-skill-registry-core
