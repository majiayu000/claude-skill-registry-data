## Defaults

| Parameter | Default Value | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| parameter_free | true | This skill has no tunable parameters; analysis scope set by temporal_scope frontmatter |

## Preflight

Run canonical pre-flight per `contracts/preflight.md`. Include the `X-Agentii-Trace` header on every tool call per `contracts/x-agentii-trace-header.md` — carry the `_run_id` from your first tool result and name yourself (and your parent, if you were spawned).

## Data Source Priority

1. Strategy methodology — `references/strategy-methodology.md` (bundled long/short framework)
2. Strategy frameworks — `search_investment_strategies(domain=fundamental)`
3. Historical precedent — `search_investment_cases` + `search_by_analogue(company_situation=...)`
4. Financials — `search_xbrl_facts` for unit economics and decline-rate evidence

## Methodology

### Retrieval Scope
structured_only

### Retrieval Strategy
**Ownership & insider signals**: `search_institutional_holdings` (top-10 holders + whale portfolios, `direction=accumulating|reducing|new|exited`) and `search_insider_trades` (Form-4 transactions with SEC URLs) are available as signal inputs.

Branch (a) Structured Data Query from `contracts/retrieval.md`. Retrieve frameworks via `search_investment_strategies`, precedent via `search_investment_cases` and `search_by_analogue`. Detailed methodology in `references/strategy-methodology.md`.

### Temporal Scope
See frontmatter temporal_scope block.

### Tool Allowlist
See frontmatter allowed_tools.

### Protocol

Every long/short position rests on an **earnings disconnect** — a gap between what the market
has priced and what the business will deliver. The unifying question across all strategy
types is: what does consensus believe, and what do I believe differently? Strategy
spectrum, short archetypes, and process detail are in `references/strategy-methodology.md`.

**Consensus is not the published number.** Sell-side consensus is a simple average of
analyst estimates; buy-side consensus typically moves ahead of it. Trading against the
published figure while the real positioning has already shifted is a common and expensive
error. Triangulate the effective buy-side expectation before sizing any view.

#### Steps

1. **Strategy Classification**: Place the idea on the spectrum from spread-focused to
   fundamentals-focused — merger arbitrage (0-18mo), general event-driven (0-24mo), activist
   (0-24mo), value/deep value (0-5yr+), growth or growth-at-reasonable-price (0-5yr+). The
   classification sets the expected holding period and the evidence bar. Categories overlap;
   record the dominant driver rather than forcing a single label.

2. **Consensus Reconstruction**: Establish the published sell-side figure, then estimate the
   effective buy-side expectation. Document the gap and its direction — the disconnect is
   the position, not the absolute valuation level.

3. **Idea Provenance**: Record how the idea was sourced — industry research and trade events,
   tangential analysis of adjacent markets, practitioner conversations, curated research
   communities, or quantitative screens. Provenance predicts which failure modes to test
   for: screen-sourced ideas need qualitative validation, conversation-sourced ideas need
   independent quantitative confirmation.

4. **Long-Side Thesis**: Apply value or growth frameworks per classification. Value requires
   a discount to net present value on a price basis; growth requires a discount on an
   earnings basis. State which, and why the market has mispriced it.

5. **Short-Side Archetype** (when shorting): Classify into one of three patterns —
   **competition short** (complacent incumbent facing a credible new entrant; test the
   entrant's unit economics and assess whether incumbent management can and will react),
   **consumer euphoria** (a product with outsized enthusiasm that will not sustain; test via
   market sizing and product work), or **disappearing business** (an incumbent in a
   structurally terminal market; establish the rate of decline, the cash-flow profile during
   decline, and whether cash can be redeployed). Each archetype has a distinct evidence
   requirement — do not substitute a valuation opinion for the archetype test.

6. **Precedent Retrieval**: Query `search_by_analogue` for the matching situation and
   `search_investment_cases` for outcome history. Weight precedent by archetype match, not
   sector match.

7. **Risk and Invalidation**: Name what would falsify the thesis and by when. For shorts,
   additionally record borrow availability, short interest, and days-to-cover — a correct
   short thesis in a crowded, hard-to-borrow name is not an executable position.

8. **Output**: Deliver the classification, the quantified disconnect, the archetype evidence,
   precedent with /v/ citations, and explicit invalidation conditions.

## Output Structure

1. **Executive Summary** — strategy classification, the disconnect, and direction in 2-3 sentences
2. **Strategy Classification** — position on the spread-to-fundamentals spectrum with expected holding period
3. **Consensus Disconnect** — published sell-side figure vs estimated buy-side expectation, with the gap quantified
4. **Idea Provenance** — sourcing route and the failure modes it implies
5. **Thesis Detail** — long-side value/growth basis, or short-side archetype with its specific evidence test
6. **Historical Analogues** — archetype-matched precedent with /v/ citations
7. **Executability** — for shorts: borrow, short interest, days-to-cover
8. **Risk and Invalidation** — falsification conditions and deadline
9. **Coverage Gaps** — data limitations and degraded flags

## Error Handling

| Error | Fallback |
|-------|----------|
| No strategy frameworks available | Proceed with `references/strategy-methodology.md`; flag `knowledge_coverage: degraded` |
| Buy-side consensus cannot be triangulated | Report the sell-side figure only and mark the disconnect as unquantified |
| Borrow / short-interest data unavailable | Mark the short as not executability-cleared; do not present it as actionable |
| `search_by_analogue` returns empty | Continue without precedent; annotate `coverage_gap` |
