# runZero  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `runzero-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/runzero/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/runzero/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `runzero-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `runzero-cli` and `runzero-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

runZero's console and SDK answer one query at a time, online-only, against a license-bound daily quota. This CLI syncs your assets, services, software, certificates, and vulnerability findings into local SQLite once, then turns 'what changed on my attack surface' (diff), 'what critical thing is exposed and vulnerable' (triage), and 'who is affected by this CVE' (affected) into a single quota-free local command  -  with --json, --select, --agent output, and typed exit codes for clean scripting.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this CLI when you need to query, slice, or diff a runZero attack surface repeatedly without spending the license-bound daily API quota, when you need to join assets to services/software/vulnerabilities offline (which the live API cannot do in one call), or when you are scripting inventory pulls, exposure triage, scan orchestration, or fleet hygiene into your own tooling. It is the right choice for MSP/MSSP weekly exposure sweeps, incident-response CVE pivots, and asset-inventory cleanup.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Attack-surface intelligence (local store)
- **`diff`**  -  Show which assets, services, ports, and software appeared or disappeared between two local syncs.

  _Reach for this to answer 'what changed on my attack surface' without re-querying the live API or paying any daily quota._

  ```bash
  runzero-cli diff --since 7d --agent
  ```
- **`triage`**  -  Rank assets by criticality joined to their exposed services and high-severity vulnerability findings.

  _Pick this when you need the single ranked list of 'what critical thing is exposed and vulnerable' instead of three separate API queries reconciled by hand._

  ```bash
  runzero-cli triage --internet-facing --agent
  ```
- **`affected`**  -  Given a CVE, list every affected asset with its services and criticality.

  _During an incident, use this to get the blast radius of an advisory in one command._

  ```bash
  runzero-cli affected CVE-2024-3094 --agent
  ```
- **`exposure-map`**  -  Roll up which protocols and ports are exposed across a CIDR, asset-counted per service.

  _Use this to see which subnets concentrate risky exposed services before planning a scan or segmentation change._

  ```bash
  runzero-cli exposure-map 10.0.0.0/8 --agent
  ```
- **`exposure-delta`**  -  List services and ports that became newly exposed or newly vulnerable since the last sync, ranked by asset criticality.

  _Run this after each sync for the Monday-morning answer to 'what NEW thing is exposed', without burning daily API quota._

  ```bash
  runzero-cli exposure-delta --agent
  ```
- **`certs-expiring`**  -  List TLS certificates expiring within a window or using weak crypto, joined to the asset and service presenting them.

  _Use this in the weekly exposure sweep to catch expiring or weak certs with the asset context needed to act._

  ```bash
  runzero-cli certs-expiring --days 30 --agent
  ```

### Fleet hygiene (local store)
- **`software rollup`**  -  Group installed software by product and version with a count of assets running each.

  _Use this to find how many distinct versions of a package are deployed and which assets run the laggards._

  ```bash
  runzero-cli software rollup <name> --agent   # e.g. <name> = openssl
  ```
- **`stale`**  -  Bucket assets by last-seen age, end-of-life OS, and missing tag/owner  -  emitting IDs ready to pipe into the bulk commands.

  _Run this for a weekly hygiene pass, then act on the asset_ids with the org bulk-asset commands (e.g. org remove-bulk-assets to retire them)._

  ```bash
  runzero-cli stale --days 30 --agent
  ```

### Scan orchestration
- **`scan-watch`**  -  Start a scan on a site and follow the task to completion in one command, with a typed exit code on the result.

  _Use this to script 'scan and wait' into a pipeline instead of babysitting the console task page or re-pasting a polling loop._

  ```bash
  runzero-cli scan-watch 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 --targets 10.0.0.0/24 --json
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
runzero-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Sync then triage exposure offline

```bash
runzero-cli inventory sync && runzero-cli triage --internet-facing --agent
```

Pull the inventory once, then rank internet-facing assets by criticality and vulnerability exposure entirely from the local store.

### Narrow a deeply-nested asset list for an agent

```bash
runzero-cli org get-assets --search 'alive:t protocols:smb2' --agent --select id,addresses,os,services.protocol,services.port
```

Live asset records nest services and addresses; --select with dotted paths returns only the fields an agent needs so it does not burn context on the full payload.

### CVE blast radius during an incident

```bash
runzero-cli affected CVE-2024-3094 --agent
```

Pivot from a single advisory to every affected asset, its services, and its criticality in one local join.

### Weekly stale-asset hygiene list

```bash
runzero-cli stale --days 45 --json --select asset_id,name,reasons
```

Find assets not seen in 45 days (plus EOL-OS and untagged/unowned) locally; feed the asset_ids into org update-bulk-asset-tags or org remove-bulk-assets to clean up.

### Software version rollup across the fleet

```bash
runzero-cli software rollup <name> --agent   # e.g. <name> = openssl
```

Group every installed build of a product (here, OpenSSL) by version with the count of assets running each, so you can target the outdated ones. Omit `<name>` to roll up the entire software inventory.

## Auth Setup

runZero uses an HTTP Bearer API token. The token prefix encodes its scope: an Account key (starts with CT) reaches everything, an Organization key (starts with OT) reaches the org and export endpoints, and an Export token (starts with ET) reaches export endpoints only. Set your token in the environment and run doctor to confirm it is accepted before syncing (doctor checks connectivity, not scope  -  the prefix letters above are the scope signal).

Run `runzero-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  runzero-cli account create-asset-ownership-types --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
runzero-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
runzero-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
runzero-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/runzero-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `RUNZERO_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `RUNZERO_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
runzero-cli profile save briefing --json
runzero-cli --profile briefing account create-asset-ownership-types
runzero-cli profile list --json
runzero-cli profile show briefing
runzero-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `runzero-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add runzero-mcp -- runzero-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which runzero-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   runzero-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `runzero-cli <command> --help`.
