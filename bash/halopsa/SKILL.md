# HaloPSA  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `halopsa-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/halopsa/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/halopsa/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `halopsa-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `halopsa-cli` and `halopsa-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Wraps the full Halo REST API (952 endpoints across tickets, clients, assets, contracts, time, KB, and workflows) with offline-first search, agent-native JSON output, and cross-entity commands like `triage`, `client card`, and `contracts burn` that join tables Halo's UI scatters across five tabs.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for halopsa-cli when an agent needs to triage, dispatch, or report against a HaloPSA / HaloITSM / HaloCRM tenant without clicking through the web UI. It is the right tool for cross-entity questions ("who's overloaded", "which tickets are about to breach", "which client is burning their contract"), bulk operations (stale-ticket close, batch action posts, batch time entries), and ETLs that previously required hand-rolled scripts. It is NOT the right tool for end-user portal browsing or for tenants you don't have API credentials to.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cross-entity dispatch views
- **`triage`**  -  See per-agent open ticket load, stale tickets, and 24-hour SLA-breach count in one table  -  the dispatcher view Halo's UI scatters across five tabs.

  _Reach for this when an agent asks 'who should I assign this P1 to' or 'where are we bleeding'. One call, one screen._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli triage --team Support --json
  ```
- **`tickets age-out`**  -  Find tickets stale in a status for N days, preview them, then bulk-close with a templated action via --apply.

  _Reach for this on the Monday queue cleanse to close 30 stale tickets in one command instead of 30 clicks._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli tickets age-out --status "Awaiting Customer" --stale-days 14 --action-note "Auto-closing per policy" --apply
  ```
- **`sla breaching`**  -  List tickets whose targetdate falls in the next N hours, sorted by time-to-breach, with agent + client + current status.

  _Reach for this on Friday afternoon or anytime before a hand-off to pre-empt SLA breaches._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli sla breaching --within 24h --team Support --json
  ```
- **`agent workload`**  -  Per-agent: open tickets, tickets touched this week, billable hours logged, oldest open ticket age.

  _Reach for this when rebalancing the queue or asking 'who's overloaded'._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli agent workload --team Support --json
  ```

### Per-client situational awareness
- **`client card`**  -  One panel: client + sites + active tickets + open contracts + contract hours remaining + recent KB articles linked to their tickets + asset count.

  _Reach for this on every client call. Open it before answering the phone, paste it into ticket notes._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli client card "Acme Corp" --json
  ```
- **`asset history`**  -  Every ticket that touched this asset, chronological, with agent and time logged.

  _Reach for this when a machine keeps coming back to the queue  -  the pattern lives in the history, not in the latest ticket._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli asset history LAP-0042 --json
  ```
- **`kbarticle suggest`**  -  FTS5-rank KB articles against a ticket's summary + details + last action text; print top 5 with snippets.

  _Reach for this mid-call when a known fix probably exists but you don't remember the exact KB title._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli kbarticle suggest --ticket 12345 --limit 5
  ```

### Local-only analytics
- **`time gaps`**  -  List tickets the agent touched this week that have zero time logged on them.

  _Reach for this on Friday before submitting the timesheet. Stops 'I know I worked that ticket but where is it' archaeology._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli time gaps --agent=me --week current
  ```
- **`contracts burn`**  -  Per contract: hours bank, hours consumed this period (sum of billable time on that client's tickets), days remaining, projected overage.

  _Reach for this mid-month before a client conversation  -  know whether they're tracking over their bank._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli contracts burn --client "Acme Corp" --month current --json
  ```
- **`rules dump`**  -  Print every ticket rule and workflow as readable flat text  -  conditions → actions, one block per rule.

  _Reach for this during quarterly automation audits or when investigating an unexpected routing._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli rules dump --workflow "New Ticket" > rules-audit.txt
  ```
- **`tickets changed-since`**  -  Tickets where any action or status change occurred since timestamp, grouped by ticket.

  _Reach for this after a meeting or when coming back from lunch. 'What did I miss' in one call._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli tickets changed-since 09:00 --mine --json
  ```
- **`standup`**  -  Per-agent for the window: tickets closed, tickets reopened, time logged, top client.

  _Reach for this the moment before standup. One paste, everyone sees yesterday's progress._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli standup --team Support --since yesterday
  ```
- **`client overlay`**  -  Rank all clients by a chosen metric (open tickets, stale, SLA at-risk, hours over bank). Top N out.

  _Reach for this when looking for the next escalation to invest time in. Whichever client is on top is the one to call._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli client overlay --metric open_tickets --top 10 --json
  ```

### Local state that compounds
- **`time leaks`**  -  Billable time entries not yet attached to any invoice, summed by client and agent  -  the revenue sitting un-invoiced.

  _Reach for this in Monday billing prep to catch revenue leaks before invoices go out._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli time leaks --month current --json
  ```

### Reporting that writes itself
- **`sla scorecard`**  -  Historical SLA pass-rate for closed tickets  -  % met resolution targets, by team or agent.

  _Reach for this for the weekly leadership report instead of a brittle export pipeline._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli sla scorecard --since 30d --by team
  ```

### Cross-entity intelligence
- **`assets expiring`**  -  Assets whose linked contract ends in the next N days, joined to the owning client and sorted by days-to-expiry.

  _Reach for this in renewal prep and proactive replacement planning._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli assets expiring --within 60
  ```
- **`tickets reopens`**  -  Tickets that bounced from closed back to open in the window, grouped by agent and client with reopen counts.

  _Reach for this in quality audits to find boomerang patterns by agent or client._

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli tickets reopens --since 30d
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
halopsa-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Monday queue cleanse

```bash
halopsa-cli tickets age-out --status "Awaiting Customer Reply" --stale-days 14 --action-note "Auto-closing per policy"
```

Preview every stale customer-waiting ticket. Add --apply when you're ready to close them.

### Friday SLA radar before hand-off

```bash
halopsa-cli sla breaching --within 24h --team Support --agent --select id,summary,client_name,agent_name,minutes_to_breach
```

List every ticket the on-call shift inherits that's at risk of breaching SLA in their first 24h. Pipe to anything.

### Pre-call client briefing

```bash
halopsa-cli client card "Acme Corp" --agent --select active_tickets,contract_hours_remaining,assets,recent_kb_links
```

Get the client's complete situation in one query before answering the phone. Use --select to narrow what an agent sees.

### Friday timesheet reconcile

```bash
halopsa-cli time gaps --agent=me --week current --json
```

Find every ticket you touched this week with zero time logged so the gap doesn't ship with your timesheet.

### Contract overage check before client meeting

```bash
halopsa-cli contracts burn --client "Acme Corp" --month current --json
```

See current hours consumed vs. bank with projected overage so the contract conversation isn't a surprise.

## Auth Setup

Halo uses OAuth2 client_credentials. Create an API application in your tenant under Configuration > Integrations > Halo PSA API (Authentication Method: Client ID and Secret  -  Services), set `HALOPSA_TENANT=<yoursub>` in your env, then run `halopsa-cli auth login --client-id <id> --client-secret <secret>`. The CLI exchanges the credentials at https://<tenant>.halopsa.com/auth/token and caches the access token (auto-refreshed before expiry).

Run `halopsa-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  halopsa-cli actions list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
halopsa-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
halopsa-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
halopsa-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/halopsa-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `HALOPSA_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `HALOPSA_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
halopsa-cli profile save briefing --json
halopsa-cli --profile briefing actions list
halopsa-cli profile list --json
halopsa-cli profile show briefing
halopsa-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `halopsa-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add halopsa-mcp -- halopsa-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which halopsa-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   halopsa-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `halopsa-cli <command> --help`.
