# agentii.constitution

## Bootstrap (empty workspace, Q83)

Scaffolds `constitution.md` (prose, SemVer footer, Sync Impact Report slot) +
`constitution.yaml` (arity constraints, budgets, drift thresholds) +
`assumptions.yaml` + `value-checks.yaml` + `taxonomy.yaml` — all with `[ALL_CAPS]`
placeholders. `constitution_pin: unratified` is legal until ratification.

## Bump rules (Q33 — written in, not advisory)

| bump | meaning | consequence |
|---|---|---|
| MAJOR | a principle removed or incompatibly redefined | `stale` + gate-5 → dispatch re-examination |
| MINOR | a principle added or substantially extended | `stale` + gate-5 → dispatch re-examination |
| PATCH | wording only | **nothing** |

Mislabeling a substantive change as PATCH is the one social failure this mechanism
cannot self-correct — the Sync Impact Report (`old → new`, changed principles,
deferred TODO) makes the diff visible to review.

## Re-examination dispatch (Q33 A+)

MINOR/MAJOR → all `constitution_pin`-older theses marked `stale` → **budget report
first** (affected theses × pillars) → human confirms via gate 5 → dispatch. Scope
is bounded by the Sync Impact Report (only pillars depending on amended principles).

## Invocation

```bash
# Resolve the kit root first — contracts/kit-root.md. The kit's scripts do NOT ship
# with the skills, so never assume the CWD is the checkout.
KIT=""
for c in "${AGENTII_KIT_ROOT:-}" \
         "$(cat "$HOME/.claude/skills/agentii/.kit-root" 2>/dev/null)" \
         "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}"; do
  [ -n "$c" ] && [ -f "$c/scripts/agentii_cmd.py" ] && { KIT="$c"; break; }
done
if [ -z "$KIT" ]; then d="$PWD"; while [ "$d" != "/" ]; do
  [ -f "$d/scripts/agentii_cmd.py" ] && { KIT="$d"; break; }; d="$(dirname "$d")"; done; fi
[ -n "$KIT" ] || { echo "agentii kit not found — see contracts/kit-root.md" >&2; exit 1; }
