description: Show at-a-glance status of all per-repo Phase 2 dev-team sessions across the active acme-* fleet. Reports which repos are running, idle, crashed, or completed. Use when CEO asks "how are the dev teams doing", "what's the sprint status", "any crashes?", or wants a fleet snapshot.

# Sprint Status Across Active Fleet

## Read the active repo registry

```!
CTO_HOME_REQUIRED=1
# >>> CTO-HOME ANCHOR (canonical — sync with: bash scripts/cto/lint-skills.sh --apply) >>>
# Fleet state lives in the CTO home, and neither obvious anchor is reliable alone:
# `git rev-parse` returns whatever repo the SHELL sits in, so one lingering cd into a dev
# repo silently retargets the skill; and $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR was observed EMPTY in skill
# shells (2026-08-13) — /handoff then resolved the registry against a dev repo and refused
# with an error that blamed the registry rather than the anchoring. So: try every anchor,
# VALIDATE each candidate before accepting it, and when none holds either fail naming the
# real cause or fall back explicitly and say so.
# Skills that read the fleet registry set CTO_HOME_REQUIRED=1 before this block.
#
# NO POSITIONAL PARAMETERS IN THIS BLOCK — no dollar-1, no dollar-2, not even awk's dollar-1.
# (Spelled out rather than written literally, because the rewrite described next hits comments
#  too: a literal example here would itself be replaced with argument text.)
#
# This block is embedded in SKILL.md, and the skill runtime rewrites every dollar-followed-by-
# digits token in the FILE with the invocation's arguments before the shell ever sees it. The
# rewrite is document-wide: no awareness of code fences, no escape (a backslash before it does
# not protect it — it renders empty), and it applies inside comments and string literals alike.
# A shell function's own positional parameter is therefore replaced by argument text, and when
# the skill is invoked with no arguments it is replaced by nothing at all.
#
# The first version of this block used positional parameters and was consequently broken from
# the day it shipped: _cto_is_home tested a garbage path on every candidate, so the anchor
# NEVER matched, and every skill carrying it silently fell back to the cwd repo — precisely the
# confident wrong answer it was written to prevent. Found 2026-09-01, six weeks after it
# shipped, because the fallback usually landed on the right repo by luck.
#
# Candidates are passed in named variables instead. Brace-wrapped positionals happen to survive
# the rewrite; do not use them either — the next person to write the bare form reintroduces the
# bug, and it fails silently. Guarded by lint CHECK E.

## Your task as CTO

Read the table above. Present to the CEO in tight form:
1. **Headline:** "N of M repos are RUNNING / IDLE / CRASHED / COMPLETE / no-session"
2. **Crashed repos (if any):** name them and suggest `/resume-dev-team <repo>`
3. **Stalled IDLE sessions (no activity >30min):** flag them — may need attention or `/peek` to investigate
4. **Completed repos:** suggest `/sprint-accept <sprint-dir>` if not already done

If no Phase 2 sessions exist on any repo, just say so — that means we're between sprints or pre-rollout.

Sign as: — CTO
