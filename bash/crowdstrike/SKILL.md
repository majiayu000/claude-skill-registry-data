# CrowdStrike Falcon  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `crowdstrike-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/crowdstrike/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/crowdstrike/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `crowdstrike-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `crowdstrike-cli` and `crowdstrike-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Match the official Falcon CLIs feature-for-feature on alerts, devices, incidents, Spotlight vulnerabilities, prevention policies, and MSSP Flight Control  -  then go beyond them. fleet sync pulls every child tenant into one local SQLite store keyed by CID, so fleet scorecard, fleet vulns, fleet stale, and fleet policy-drift answer cross-tenant questions instantly and offline, with agent-native JSON on every command.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this CLI when an agent or operator needs to inspect or act on a CrowdStrike Falcon estate  -  especially an MSP/MSSP estate spanning many child CIDs. It is the right tool for cross-tenant posture questions (vulnerabilities, stale sensors, policy drift, alert triage) that would otherwise require dozens of live, paginated API calls, and for any scripted alert/device/incident/policy action with agent-native JSON output.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Real-Time Response (RTR) shell sessions, file get/put, or script execution - not implemented; use Falcon-Toolkit or the Falcon console
- Sensor install/uninstall or update rollouts - use your RMM or the Falcon console
- Streaming detections into a SIEM - use the CrowdStrike SIEM connector / Falcon Data Replicator
- Legacy /detects/* Detects API workflows - decommissioned upstream; the Alerts API commands replace it
- Cross-tenant fleet rollups without a parent-CID Flight Control API client - they degrade to single-CID coverage

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cross-tenant fleet intelligence
- **`fleet sync`**  -  Pull hosts, alerts, vulnerabilities, policies, and the Flight Control fabric from every child tenant into one local store keyed by CID. Requires a parent-CID API client with Flight Control (MSSP) scope; without it, sync degrades to the single authenticated CID.

  _Reach for this first: it builds the offline fleet store every other fleet command reads from._

  ```bash
  crowdstrike-cli fleet sync --all-cids --json
  ```
- **`fleet scorecard`**  -  One posture board across all tenants: host count, sensor coverage, open critical alerts, critical vulns, and policy posture per CID.

  _Use when an agent needs a whole-book-of-business health summary without dozens of live calls._

  ```bash
  crowdstrike-cli fleet scorecard --json
  ```
- **`fleet vulns`**  -  Rank and filter Spotlight vulnerabilities across every tenant at once, by severity or CVE.

  _Use to answer 'every critical exposure across all customers' in one shot._

  ```bash
  crowdstrike-cli fleet vulns --severity critical --json
  ```
- **`fleet stale`**  -  Find hosts across all tenants whose sensor has not checked in within N days.

  _Use to catch coverage gaps (offline sensors) before they become blind spots._

  ```bash
  crowdstrike-cli fleet stale --days 14 --json
  ```
- **`fleet policy-drift`**  -  Diff each tenant's prevention policy settings against a baseline CID to surface under-protected tenants.

  _Use to enforce a security baseline across a multi-tenant book._

  ```bash
  crowdstrike-cli fleet policy-drift --json
  ```
- **`fleet alerts`**  -  One severity-sorted new-alert queue spanning all tenants, from the local store.

  _The MSP analyst's morning view: what needs attention across every customer, ranked._

  ```bash
  crowdstrike-cli fleet alerts --status new --json
  ```
- **`fleet tenants`**  -  See the whole Flight Control fabric - every child CID, its CID groups, user groups, and role grants - as one offline roster.

  _Reach for this when you need the multi-tenant RBAC and tenant roster without walking five live MSSP endpoints._

  ```bash
  crowdstrike-cli fleet tenants --agent
  ```
- **`fleet remediate`**  -  Group fleet-wide exposure by remediation action - which single fix clears the most hosts and tenants.

  _Use this to turn a vulnerability list into a patch worklist ranked by cross-tenant blast radius._

  ```bash
  crowdstrike-cli fleet remediate --severity critical --agent
  ```
- **`fleet trend`**  -  See which tenants got worse since the last sync - week-over-week deltas in open critical alerts and critical vulnerabilities.

  _Use this for degradation detection across the book of business - the live API only ever shows current state._

  ```bash
  crowdstrike-cli fleet trend --agent
  ```

### Offline intelligence
- **`fleet search`**  -  Full-text search across synced hosts, alerts, vulnerabilities, and policies across all tenants, instantly and offline.

  _Use for instant lookups without burning live API quota or waiting on pagination._

  ```bash
  crowdstrike-cli fleet search <term> --json --select cid,kind,name
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
crowdstrike-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Whole-fleet critical exposure

```bash
crowdstrike-cli fleet vulns --severity critical --agent --select cid,cve,hostname,severity
```

Pulls every critical Spotlight vuln across all tenants from the store and narrows to the fields an agent needs.

### Morning triage queue

```bash
crowdstrike-cli fleet alerts --status new --agent --select cid,severity,name,device.hostname
```

One severity-sorted new-alert queue across every tenant, field-narrowed for agent context.

### Coverage audit

```bash
crowdstrike-cli fleet stale --days 30 --json
```

Lists hosts whose sensor has gone dark for 30+ days across the whole fleet.

### Baseline enforcement

```bash
crowdstrike-cli fleet policy-drift --json
```

Surfaces tenants whose prevention policy is weaker than the baseline CID.

### Tenant coverage at a glance

```bash
crowdstrike-cli fleet scorecard --agent --select cid,coverage_pct,critical_vulns,open_critical_alerts
```

Narrows the per-tenant posture board to the fields an agent needs to triage the fleet.

## Auth Setup

Auth is OAuth2 client_credentials. Create an API client in the Falcon console (Support > API Clients & Keys) with scopes for the resources you use, then set FALCON_CLIENT_ID and FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET and run 'crowdstrike-cli auth login' to mint and cache a bearer token (auto-refreshed before expiry). For MSSP/Flight Control, a single parent-CID client operates on child tenants by minting a member_cid-scoped token; the fleet commands handle this for you, minting a per-tenant token for each child CID (or for a single tenant you name). Pick your cloud by overriding the base/token URL (US-1 default, US-2, EU-1, or GovCloud).

Run `crowdstrike-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  crowdstrike-cli incidents get --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
crowdstrike-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
crowdstrike-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
crowdstrike-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/crowdstrike-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `CROWDSTRIKE_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `CROWDSTRIKE_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
crowdstrike-cli profile save briefing --json
crowdstrike-cli --profile briefing incidents get
crowdstrike-cli profile list --json
crowdstrike-cli profile show briefing
crowdstrike-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `crowdstrike-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add crowdstrike-mcp -- crowdstrike-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which crowdstrike-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   crowdstrike-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `crowdstrike-cli <command> --help`.
