# Maxio  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `maxio-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/maxio/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/maxio/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `maxio-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `maxio-cli` and `maxio-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Every Maxio Advanced Billing resource is queryable offline, but the point is the revenue math no other tool computes: the five-bucket MRR movement waterfall, NRR/GRR/quick-ratio, per-client recurring-revenue history, and a 'what needs attention' triage rollup. It snapshots each sync into a local time series, so historic cohort and retention curves accrue even though the live API has no endpoint to reconstruct them after the fact. Reads are the safe default; mutating commands execute only when you invoke them.

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI when an agent or operator needs Maxio recurring-revenue intelligence from the terminal: current and historic MRR/ARR, the movement waterfall, retention and churn, per-client revenue, and a revenue triage list. It is the right tool when the answer requires joining or trending data across subscriptions, customers, components, and invoices, or when the Maxio dashboard is too slow/manual to query.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Do not use this CLI for GAAP recognized revenue, ASC 606, or deferred-revenue schedules  -  those live in SaaS Optics, a separate Maxio API not covered by this build.
- Do not point an autonomous agent at create, cancel, refund, or modify operations against production without a human in the loop  -  these are real writes that execute when invoked; preview them with --dry-run and require approval (see governance.md).
- Do not use it for payment processing, collections, or dunning actions.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### History the live API can't reconstruct
- **`mrr waterfall`**  -  See MRR move month over month, broken into New, Expansion, Contraction, Churn, and Reactivation  -  plus ARR and growth rate.

  _Reach for this when an agent needs the recurring-revenue movement breakdown for a period instead of a single point-in-time number._

  ```bash
  maxio-cli mrr waterfall --since 2026-01-01 --group-by month --agent
  ```
- **`mrr client`**  -  Normalized MRR for one customer or the whole book, with the history the live API has no endpoint for.

  _Use this to answer 'what is recurring revenue for this account, and how has it trended' without scraping the dashboard._

  ```bash
  maxio-cli mrr client --customer 1234567 --since 2025-01-01 --agent
  ```
- **`retention`**  -  Net and gross revenue retention, logo churn, revenue churn, and quick ratio over any window.

  _Pick this when the question is about retention ratios over time rather than the raw movement dollars._

  ```bash
  maxio-cli retention --since 2025-01-01 --group-by month --agent
  ```
- **`cohort`**  -  Revenue and logo retention by signup-month cohort across N periods.

  _Use for cohort analysis; depth grows as the local snapshot history accumulates across syncs._

  ```bash
  maxio-cli cohort --by signup-month --periods 12 --agent
  ```

### Agent-native revenue ops
- **`triage`**  -  A ranked list of accounts that need attention: past-due, large upcoming renewals, and high-value concentration.

  _Reach for this to answer 'what revenue needs my attention this week' in one call instead of fanning out across endpoints._

  ```bash
  maxio-cli triage --limit 20 --agent
  ```
- **`reconcile`**  -  Per-customer gaps between normalized MRR and the amounts actually invoiced, with the deltas flagged.

  _Use this to catch where normalized recurring revenue and invoiced amounts diverge (discounts, usage spikes, proration)._

  ```bash
  maxio-cli reconcile --since 2026-01-01 --agent
  ```
- **`usage-drivers`**  -  Which metered/usage components drove expansion versus contraction MRR, ranked.

  _Pick this when expansion or contraction needs to be attributed to specific usage-billed components._

  ```bash
  maxio-cli usage-drivers --since 2026-01-01 --limit 20 --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
maxio-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Board-prep MRR movement

```bash
maxio-cli mrr waterfall --since 2026-01-01 --group-by month --agent
```

The month-by-month New/Expansion/Contraction/Churn/Reactivation breakdown, agent-formatted for a deck.

### Narrow a deeply-nested subscription pull

```bash
maxio-cli subscriptions-json list-subscriptions --agent --select subscription.product.name,subscription.state,subscription.current_period_ends_at
```

Use --agent with --select dotted paths so the agent reads only the fields it needs instead of the full nested subscription payload.

### Find accounts that need attention

```bash
maxio-cli triage --limit 20 --agent
```

Ranked accounts that need attention: past-due, large upcoming renewals, and high-value concentration.

### Reconcile one client's normalized vs billed

```bash
maxio-cli reconcile --customer 1234567 --since 2026-01-01 --agent
```

Per-customer gaps between normalized MRR and what was actually invoiced for that client.

## Auth Setup

Maxio Advanced Billing uses HTTP Basic authentication. Set three environment variables: MAXIO_USERNAME, MAXIO_PASSWORD, and MAXIO_SITE (your subdomain, e.g. acme for acme.chargify.com). For Advanced Billing API-key access, MAXIO_USERNAME is your API key (Config -> Integrations -> API Keys) and MAXIO_PASSWORD is the literal value 'x'. Read commands are safe to run by default; mutating commands execute when you invoke them (some prompt for confirmation interactively, which --agent/--yes skips), so preview with --dry-run and approve writes per your agent policy.

Run `maxio-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  maxio-cli api-exports export-invoices --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
maxio-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
maxio-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
maxio-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/maxio-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `MAXIO_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `MAXIO_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration.

```
maxio-cli profile save briefing --json
maxio-cli --profile briefing api-exports export-invoices
maxio-cli profile list --json
maxio-cli profile show briefing
maxio-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `maxio-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add maxio-mcp -- maxio-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which maxio-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   maxio-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `maxio-cli <command> --help`.
