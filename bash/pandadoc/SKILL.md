# PandaDoc  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `pandadoc-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/pandadoc/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/pandadoc/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `pandadoc-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `pandadoc-cli` and `pandadoc-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

pandadoc-cli wraps the full PandaDoc Public API and syncs documents, templates, contacts, content library, and webhooks into a local SQLite store. On top of that it answers questions the API can't: which documents are stalled (stalled), how long they've aged (aging), which recipients never sign (engagement), and how much quote value is in flight (value).

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for pandadoc-cli when an agent or operator needs to inspect or drive a PandaDoc document workflow from the terminal: creating documents from templates, sending and tracking signing status, or answering pipeline questions (stalled deals, aging, open quote value, recipient engagement) that the PandaDoc API exposes no single endpoint for. It is ideal for MSP/sales operations that live in proposals, quotes, MSAs, and SOWs.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Drafting or reviewing contract LANGUAGE  -  this CLI moves documents through PandaDoc; it does not write or interpret legal text.
- E-signing a document yourself  -  signing happens in the recipient's PandaDoc session, not via this CLI.
- Documents stored outside PandaDoc (Google Docs, DocuSign, local PDFs not uploaded)  -  only the PandaDoc workspace is visible.
- Editing a document's body content or layout  -  the API exposes fields/tokens/pricing, not free-form content editing; use the PandaDoc editor.
- Real-time webhook delivery  -  webhook-coverage audits subscriptions; receiving events needs your own webhook endpoint, not this CLI.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Pipeline intelligence
- **`pipeline`**  -  See your whole document funnel at a glance  -  how many are in draft, sent, viewed, completed, or declined.

  _Reach for this when you need a single status breakdown instead of paging the documents endpoint and counting yourself._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli pipeline --agent
  ```
- **`stalled`**  -  Find documents that were sent but never completed within N days  -  the deals quietly dying.

  _Use before a pipeline review to surface proposals that need a nudge._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli stalled --days 14 --agent
  ```
- **`aging`**  -  Show how long each document has sat in its current status, bucketed by age.

  _Pick this to spot bottlenecks  -  where documents pile up between sent and signed._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli aging --agent
  ```
- **`template-stats`**  -  Per-template document counts and completion rates  -  which templates actually close.

  _Reach for this to retire low-converting templates and double down on winners._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli template-stats --agent
  ```
- **`value`**  -  Sum the quote/pricing totals across all open (non-completed) documents  -  your in-flight dollar value.

  _Use for a fast forecast of pipeline value without exporting to a spreadsheet._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli value --status sent --agent
  ```
- **`since`**  -  Show what changed in the last N hours  -  new documents and status transitions.

  _Run at the start of the day to catch every document that moved overnight._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli since 4h --agent
  ```
- **`forecast`**  -  Bucket open quote dollars into healthy, aging, and stalled tiers by deal age.

  _Reach for this when a flat open-value total isn't enough and you need dollars-at-risk by deal age._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli forecast --agent
  ```

### Relationship intelligence
- **`engagement`**  -  Rank recipients by how often they open and sign vs. let documents sit unread.

  _Use to find which clients consistently stall so you can change how you route to them._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli engagement --agent
  ```
- **`cold-clients`**  -  Rank clients by how long since they last signed anything  -  spot the accounts going quiet.

  _Reach for this when you need account-level recency (who went cold), not per-document status or per-recipient rates._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli cold-clients --days 30 --agent
  ```
- **`followup`**  -  A ranked nudge worklist: stalled documents joined to recipient emails and days-since-sent, ready for outreach.

  _Reach for this when you need who-to-nudge with contact emails attached, not just a stalled-document list._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli followup --days 7 --agent
  ```

### Operational safety
- **`webhook-coverage`**  -  Compare your active webhook subscriptions against the full event catalog to find gaps.

  _Use to confirm you won't miss a document.state_changed event before relying on automations._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli webhook-coverage --agent
  ```
- **`reminder-gaps`**  -  Find sent-but-incomplete documents that have no active auto-reminder set  -  queries the live API per document (needs PANDADOC_API_KEY).

  _Reach for this to verify PandaDoc is auto-nudging signers before you nudge manually; unlike the other store-backed analytics it makes live API calls._

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli reminder-gaps --max-scan-docs 25 --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
pandadoc-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Morning pipeline check

```bash
pandadoc-cli sync && pandadoc-cli pipeline --agent
```

Refresh the store, then print the status funnel for a fast standup view.

### Find stalling proposals

```bash
pandadoc-cli stalled --days 10 --json --select id,name,status,date_modified
```

List documents sent but unsigned for 10 days, narrowed to the fields that matter.

### Forecast in-flight value

```bash
pandadoc-cli value --status sent --agent
```

Sum quote totals across sent documents for a quick pipeline-dollar forecast.

### Who never signs

```bash
pandadoc-cli engagement --json --select email,documents,completed
```

Rank recipients by completion rate to spot chronically slow signers.

### Confirm webhook coverage

```bash
pandadoc-cli webhook-coverage --agent
```

Check subscribed event types against the catalog before trusting an automation.

## Auth Setup

Authenticate with a PandaDoc API key. Set PANDADOC_API_KEY and every call sends the Authorization: API-Key <key> header for you.

Run `pandadoc-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  pandadoc-cli contacts list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
pandadoc-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
pandadoc-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
pandadoc-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/pandadoc-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `PANDADOC_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `PANDADOC_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
pandadoc-cli profile save briefing --json
pandadoc-cli --profile briefing contacts list
pandadoc-cli profile list --json
pandadoc-cli profile show briefing
pandadoc-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `pandadoc-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add pandadoc-mcp -- pandadoc-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which pandadoc-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   pandadoc-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `pandadoc-cli <command> --help`.
