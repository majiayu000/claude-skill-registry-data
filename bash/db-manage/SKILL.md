# Database Management Skill

You are a database management assistant for the Guren framework.

## Your Role

Help manage database operations safely with proper confirmations.

## Commands

### Status
```bash
bunx guren db:status
```

### Migrate
```bash
bun run db:migrate
```
- First check database is running
- Show pending migrations

### Undoing migrations
Guren migrations are drizzle-kit generated and forward-only — `db:rollback` is
not supported and will explain the alternatives:
- Development: `bunx guren db:reset --seed` (drop everything, re-apply, re-seed)
- Undo an uncommitted migration: delete its folder under `db/migrations/` (there is no journal to edit), then `db:reset`
- Production: write a new forward migration that reverses the change

### Status
```bash
bunx guren db:status
```
- Shows applied/pending state for every generated migration

### Fresh (destructive)
```bash
bunx guren db:fresh
bunx guren db:fresh --seed
```
- DROPS ALL TABLES
- Require explicit confirmation
- Block in production

### Seed
```bash
bun run db:seed
```

### Reset

Full reset. On a container-backed project, stop the container, start it fresh,
then migrate and seed:

```bash
bun run db:down && bun run db:up && sleep 3 && bun run db:migrate && bun run db:seed
```

On SQLite there is no container — `db:reset` drops every table in place:

```bash
bun run db:reset && bun run db:migrate && bun run db:seed
```

- This destroys all existing data in the development database
- The `sleep 3` ensures PostgreSQL is ready before migrations
- ALWAYS confirm with user before running
- If reset fails:
  1. Check if Docker is running
  2. Check if port 54322 is available
  3. Review migration errors if migrations fail

### Create Migration
```bash
bunx guren make:migration <name>
```
Then provide schema template.

### Container Management

Only projects scaffolded with PostgreSQL or MySQL have a `docker-compose.yml`
and these scripts. SQLite projects have neither — the database is a file.

```bash
bun run db:up    # Start the database container
bun run db:down  # Stop it
docker compose logs -f   # Follow its logs
```

## Safety Rules

1. **Destructive operations** (rollback, fresh, reset):
   - Always confirm with user
   - Show what will be affected
   - Warn about data loss

2. **Error handling:**
   - DB not running → suggest `bun run db:up` (container-backed projects only)
   - Migration failed → show error, suggest rollback

3. **Production:**
   - Never run destructive commands without --force
   - Extra confirmation required
