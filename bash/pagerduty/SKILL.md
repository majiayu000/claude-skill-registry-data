# PagerDuty  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `pagerduty-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/pagerduty/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/pagerduty/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `pagerduty-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `pagerduty-cli` and `pagerduty-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Triage the incident queue, resolve who's on call now and next, and run service and escalation hygiene checks without leaving the shell. Sync once and the local store powers analytics no single API call exposes: pulse for what's hot right now, oncall who for the live escalation chain, audit coverage for escalation gaps, and insights mttr/responders/noisy for offline post-incident analytics.

## When to Use This CLI

Choose this CLI when an agent or operator needs to manage PagerDuty incidents, on-call schedules, services and escalation policies from the terminal, or when they need cross-entity analytics (MTTA/MTTR, on-call coverage, responder workload, noisy services) that the live API exposes only through the paid Analytics product or not at all. It is the right tool for MSP NOC triage, on-call resolution under pressure, and monthly reliability reviews.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Do not use this CLI to send or ingest events/alerts (triggering incidents from monitoring)  -  that is the PagerDuty Events API v2, a separate ingestion surface this CLI does not wrap.
- Do not use it for real-time push notifications or webhook delivery  -  it polls REST; use PagerDuty webhook subscriptions for push.
- Do not treat insights mttr/responders/noisy as a replacement for paid PagerDuty Analytics in billing disputes  -  they are offline reconstructions from synced log entries and only as complete as the last sync window.
- Do not use it to administer users/SSO/billing at the account level  -  account provisioning belongs in the PagerDuty web admin console.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local-store analytics that compounds
- **`pulse`**  -  One offline call shows what's hot right now: open incidents bucketed by service, urgency and status with how long each has gone unacknowledged, sorted by SLA risk.

  _Reach for this instead of N web-UI tabs when an agent or NOC analyst needs the current incident picture across every service in one shot._

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli pulse --agent
  ```
- **`audit coverage`**  -  Flags services whose escalation chain is broken: empty tiers, single point of failure, expired or empty schedules, or no escalation policy at all.

  _Run before an on-call rotation to catch services that would page nobody when they break._

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli audit coverage --agent
  ```
- **`insights mttr`**  -  Mean time to acknowledge and resolve, computed from synced log-entry timestamps and grouped by service, team or priority.

  _Use for post-incident reviews to get MTTA/MTTR by service this month without scripting the analytics API._

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli insights mttr --by service --since 30d --agent
  ```
- **`insights responders`**  -  Per-responder page, ack and resolve counts plus the share of pages that landed off-hours (nights and weekends).

  _Reach for this for on-call fairness and burnout reviews to see who is carrying the off-hours load._

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli insights responders --since 30d --agent
  ```
- **`insights noisy`**  -  Ranks services by incident volume, auto-resolve rate and re-trigger/flapping rate over a window.

  _Use to find which services to tune first when alert fatigue is high._

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli insights noisy --top 10 --since 7d --agent
  ```
- **`incidents changes`**  -  For an incident, see the change events that shipped on the same service in the window right before it triggered, ranked by proximity.

  _Reach for this first in root-cause triage: it answers 'what shipped right before this broke' without opening the web UI._

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli incidents changes PT4KHLK --window 120m --agent
  ```
- **`audit schedule-gaps`**  -  Find future time windows where a schedule has nobody on call, before an incident finds the hole for you.

  _Run before each rotation change to catch uncovered windows; neither the API nor the web UI has an equivalent report._

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli audit schedule-gaps --days 14 --agent
  ```
- **`insights stale`**  -  Open incidents with no log activity past a threshold, grouped by responder and service  -  the ones quietly rotting.

  _Use during shift handoffs to sweep forgotten incidents that pulse's SLA-risk ranking may not surface._

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli insights stale --hours 24 --agent
  ```

### On-call intelligence
- **`oncall who`**  -  Resolves who is on call right now for a service or team, who is on next, and the exact handoff timestamp.

  _Use at 2am to know exactly who to escalate to and when the current responder hands off, without clicking through the UI._

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli oncall who --service PXXXXXX --agent
  ```
- **`oncall hours`**  -  On-call hours per user over a time window, derived from synced schedule layers and overrides.

  _Reach for this for monthly on-call fairness or MSP billing reviews without the paid analytics product._

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli oncall hours --since 30d --agent
  ```
- **`incidents timeline`**  -  Reconstructs one incident's full chronology  -  trigger, every ack, note, reassignment, escalation and resolve  -  with elapsed deltas between events.

  _Use during or after an incident to get a clean, ordered story of what happened and how long each step took._

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli incidents timeline PXXXXXX --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
pagerduty-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Triage the morning queue

```bash
pagerduty-cli pulse --agent
```

One offline call buckets open incidents by service and urgency with unacked age, sorted by SLA risk.

### Narrow a verbose incident list for an agent

```bash
pagerduty-cli incidents list --agent --select incidents.id,incidents.title,incidents.status,incidents.service.summary
```

PagerDuty incident objects are deeply nested; dotted --select returns only the fields the agent needs and saves context.

### Find escalation coverage gaps

```bash
pagerduty-cli audit coverage --agent
```

Flags services that would page nobody  -  empty tiers, single point of failure, expired schedules, or no policy.

### Post-incident MTTR by service

```bash
pagerduty-cli insights mttr --by service --since 30d --agent
```

Reconstructs mean time to acknowledge/resolve offline from synced log entries, grouped by service.

### Resolve who to escalate to

```bash
pagerduty-cli oncall who --service PXXXXXX --agent
```

Joins escalation policy, schedule and overrides to show who is on now, who is next, and the handoff time.

## Auth Setup

Authenticate with a PagerDuty REST API key in the Authorization header as `Token token=<key>`. Set it via the PAGERDUTY_API_KEY environment variable. Read-only by default  -  mutating commands require explicit flags and support --dry-run.

Run `pagerduty-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  pagerduty-cli abilities list --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
pagerduty-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
pagerduty-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
pagerduty-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/pagerduty-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `PAGERDUTY_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `PAGERDUTY_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
pagerduty-cli profile save briefing --json
pagerduty-cli --profile briefing abilities list
pagerduty-cli profile list --json
pagerduty-cli profile show briefing
pagerduty-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `pagerduty-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add pagerduty-mcp -- pagerduty-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which pagerduty-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   pagerduty-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `pagerduty-cli <command> --help`.
