# NinjaOne  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `ninjaone-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/ninjaone/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/ninjaone/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `ninjaone-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `ninjaone-cli` and `ninjaone-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

Existing NinjaOne tools are 1:1 API mirrors or Python libraries you script yourself. This CLI syncs your whole estate into local SQLite, then answers the questions MSPs actually ask across clients with offline FTS, analytics rollups, --json/--select/--csv, and typed exit codes. Commands like patch-compliance, backup-coverage, av-sweep, fleet-health, and drift are cross-fleet joins the API never returns in one call, and every command is agent-native through the MCP Cobra-tree mirror.

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI when an agent or technician needs fleet-wide answers across many NinjaOne organizations  -  patch compliance, unprotected-device detection, AV threat blast-radius, OS end-of-life exposure, software sprawl, or week-over-week drift  -  rather than a single device or report lookup. It is also the right tool for scripted automation: every command speaks --json/--select with typed exit codes, and the local store keeps queries fast and offline.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Inspecting a single device's backup bytes or job history  -  use the generated backup / queries backup-usage commands, not backup-coverage
- Trend-over-time questions  -  use drift, not fleet-health; point-in-time scoring  -  use fleet-health, not drift
- Real-time alert paging, remote control sessions, or console-only workflows  -  this CLI covers the NinjaOne public API surface only
- Other RMM platforms (Datto RMM, N-able N-central, Atera)  -  this CLI is NinjaOne-only

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Cross-fleet rollups (local store only)
- **`patch-compliance`**  -  One row per organization showing percent OS-patched, percent software-patched, failed counts, and the worst-offender device across your whole fleet.

  _Reach for this when an agent or tech needs the single 'who is non-compliant' answer across many clients instead of pivoting two reports by hand._

  ```bash
  ninjaone-cli patch-compliance --min-pct 95 --agent
  ```
- **`backup-coverage`**  -  Lists every device with no backup usage (or zero bytes / stale job), grouped by organization, so unprotected endpoints surface immediately.

  _The fastest DR-oversight answer: which managed endpoints are silently unprotected right now._

  ```bash
  ninjaone-cli backup-coverage --agent --select deviceName,org,reason
  ```
- **`software-audit`**  -  For each software title, counts the distinct versions installed across the fleet and where each version lives; flags titles fragmented across many versions.

  _Find license sprawl and update lag (the same app at 14 versions) in one query instead of scrolling per-device inventories._

  ```bash
  ninjaone-cli software-audit --min-versions 3 --json
  ```

### Risk and exposure scoring
- **`fleet-health`**  -  A transparent 0-100 score per organization from patch, backup, AV, and stale-device signals, with the contributing deductions itemized.

  _One artifact for a quarterly business review: an agent can read the itemized deductions and explain why a client is trending down._

  ```bash
  ninjaone-cli fleet-health --org 42 --agent
  ```
- **`av-sweep`**  -  Given a threat name or a stale-definition window, lists every device fleet-wide carrying it, grouped by organization and location.

  _Turns one threat detection into a blast-radius answer during triage without walking the API device by device._

  ```bash
  ninjaone-cli av-sweep --definition-stale-days 7 --agent
  ```
- **`stale-devices`**  -  Lists devices whose last contact exceeds a threshold, with days-since and owning organization and location.

  _Surfaces endpoints that quietly stopped checking in, which are invisible in per-org device lists._

  ```bash
  ninjaone-cli stale-devices --days 14 --csv
  ```
- **`os-eol`**  -  Lists devices running end-of-life operating systems, grouped by organization, against a curated EOL reference table.

  _A security-and-compliance answer for QBRs: which clients are running OS versions past their support date._

  ```bash
  ninjaone-cli os-eol --agent
  ```

### Time-series (local snapshots)
- **`drift`**  -  Diffs the current sync against the previous stored snapshot to show which organizations got better or worse on patch, backup, or stale metrics.

  _The only way to answer 'which clients are drifting' without rebuilding a spreadsheet from scratch each week._

  ```bash
  ninjaone-cli drift --metric patch --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
ninjaone-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Monday patch-compliance review

```bash
ninjaone-cli sync && ninjaone-cli patch-compliance --min-pct 95 --agent
```

Sync the fleet, then get a per-org compliance table ready to pipe into a report or an agent.

### Find unprotected endpoints for a DR audit

```bash
ninjaone-cli backup-coverage --agent --select deviceName,org,reason
```

List every device with no/stale backup, narrowing the agent-shaped output to the fields that matter.

### AV threat blast-radius during triage

```bash
ninjaone-cli av-sweep --threat 'Trojan.Generic' --json
```

Find every device fleet-wide carrying a named threat, grouped by org and location.

### QBR health snapshot for one client

```bash
ninjaone-cli fleet-health --org 42 --agent
```

Get an itemized 0-100 health score an agent can narrate in a quarterly review.

### Narrow a verbose report for an agent

```bash
ninjaone-cli queries get-device-health-report --agent --select results.deviceId,results.healthStatus
```

Use --select with dotted paths to keep only the fields you need from a large nested report.

## Auth Setup

NinjaOne uses OAuth2 client-credentials. Create an API app under Administration > Apps > API, then set NINJAONE_CLIENT_ID and NINJAONE_CLIENT_SECRET. The default base URL is https://app.ninjarmm.com; for non-US tenants set NINJAONE_BASE_URL (e.g. https://eu.ninjarmm.com) and NINJAONE_TOKEN_URL (e.g. https://eu.ninjarmm.com/ws/oauth/token). Run 'ninjaone-cli doctor' to confirm auth and reachability.

Run `ninjaone-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  ninjaone-cli activities --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
ninjaone-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
ninjaone-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
ninjaone-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/ninjaone-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `NINJAONE_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `NINJAONE_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
ninjaone-cli profile save briefing --json
ninjaone-cli --profile briefing activities
ninjaone-cli profile list --json
ninjaone-cli profile show briefing
ninjaone-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Async Jobs

For endpoints that submit long-running work, the generator detects the submit-then-poll pattern (a `job_id`/`task_id`/`operation_id` field in the response plus a sibling status endpoint) and wires up three extra flags on the submitting command:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--wait` | Block until the job reaches a terminal status instead of returning the job ID immediately |
| `--wait-timeout` | Maximum wait duration (default 10m, 0 means no timeout) |
| `--wait-interval` | Initial poll interval (default 2s; grows with exponential backoff up to 30s) |

Use async submission without `--wait` when you want to fire-and-forget; use `--wait` when you want one command to return the finished artifact.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `ninjaone-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add ninjaone-mcp -- ninjaone-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which ninjaone-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   ninjaone-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `ninjaone-cli <command> --help`.
