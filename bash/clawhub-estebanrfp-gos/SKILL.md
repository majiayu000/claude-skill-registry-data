# ClawHub CLI

IMPORTANT: Before searching or installing from ClawHub, ALWAYS check if the skill
already exists as a bundled skill in this project. Run `ls skills/` from the project
root to list available bundled skills. Bundled skills are curated, tested, and adapted
for NyxClaw — prefer them over ClawHub versions. Only use ClawHub for skills not
available locally.

Use when you need to fetch new skills on the fly, sync installed skills to latest or a specific version, or publish new/updated skill folders.

Install

```bash
npm i -g clawhub
```

Auth (publish)

```bash
clawhub login
clawhub whoami
```

Search

```bash
clawhub search "postgres backups"
```

Install

```bash
clawhub install my-skill
clawhub install my-skill --version 1.2.3
```

Update (hash-based match + upgrade)

```bash
clawhub update my-skill
clawhub update my-skill --version 1.2.3
clawhub update --all
clawhub update my-skill --force
clawhub update --all --no-input --force
```

List

```bash
clawhub list
```

Publish

```bash
clawhub publish ./my-skill --slug my-skill --name "My Skill" --version 1.2.0 --changelog "Fixes + docs"
```

Notes

- Default registry: https://clawhub.com (override with CLAWHUB_REGISTRY or --registry)
- Default workdir: cwd (falls back to NyxClaw workspace); install dir: ./skills (override with --workdir / --dir / CLAWHUB_WORKDIR)
- Update command hashes local files, resolves matching version, and upgrades to latest unless --version is set
