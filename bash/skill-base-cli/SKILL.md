  The official Skill Base CLI client.

Triggered when users say "publish skill to skill base", "install collection", "import skill from github", "download/update/delete skill from skill base", "configure skb", "am I logged in", "check skb login", or "configure skill-base-cli".

# Pull and Publish Skills with skb

Assistants should complete operations by **running terminal commands**. Package name **`skill-base-cli`**, command **`skb`** after installation.

## When to Use This Skill
- Users request to search, install, update, delete, or publish specific skills using the `skb` command.
- Users want to install an admin-curated **collection** (recommended skill pack) in one shot.
- Users need to configure the client connection address (`skb init`) or log in (`skb login`).
- Users want to **search, install, update, or publish** Skills to a privately deployed Skill Base site.

## When NOT to Use This Skill
- Users want to deploy, start, or maintain the Skill Base server itself (use `skill-base-web-deploy` instead).


Web detail pages offer AI Agent prompts and CLI commands bound to the selected version and site. When using these, skip CLI installation if already available and choose the current agent's install directory via `skb install --help`.

Web contributor profiles at `/users/:id` list skills the user published versions for. Publishing via `skb publish` or GitHub import contributes to the same history; no separate CLI profile command is required.

The Web publish form now reveals confirmation after content is read. CLI publish and GitHub-import arguments are unchanged.

## Environment

- Node.js >= 18
- Installation: `npm install -g skill-base-cli`, or `npx skill-base-cli <subcommand>`
- Server address: Environment variable **`SKB_BASE_URL`** takes priority, otherwise reads **`~/.skill-base/config.json`**, default is `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Set and save: `skb init --server <site root URL>` (do not include `/api`)

## Login and Authentication Rules (Important)
- **No login required**: `search`, `install`, `update`, `init` and other regular read operations usually do not require login. Assistants **should not** proactively ask users to log in before these operations.
- **Login required**: **`skb publish`** and **`skb import-github`** must be logged in.
- **Login flow (`skb login`)**:
  1. Execute `skb login` in the terminal.
  2. The console will output a login page URL containing `from=cli`, open the login page in a browser.
  3. After successful web login, a **verification code** (in the format `XXXX-XXXX`) will be provided.
  4. Enter the verification code in the terminal to exchange for a PAT.
- Logout: `skb logout`.
- Check login: `skb whoami` (calls `GET /api/v1/auth/me` with the saved PAT; exit `0` if valid). Use `skb whoami -q` for scripts (exit code only) or `skb whoami --json` for machine-readable output.

## Local Web UI

- `skb ui` — starts a small server on `127.0.0.1:9847` (override with `--port`), opens the browser, proxies `/api/v1/*` to the configured Skill Base with the saved PAT. Use `--no-open`, `--host <address>` (default `127.0.0.1`).

## Search and Install

```bash
skb search <keyword>
skb install <skill_id>              # Latest version
skb install <skill_id>@<version>    # Specific version, e.g., v20260327.161122
skb install <skill_id> -d <target_directory>
skb install <skill_id> -i cursor      # Install to IDE skill directory
skb install <skill_id> -i cursor -g # Global IDE directory (where supported)
```

Options: `-d/--dir`, `-i/--ide` (alias `-a/--agent`), `-g/--global`. Common IDE values: `cursor`, `claude-code`, `codex`, `copilot`, `windsurf`, `qoder`, `opencode`, `trae`, `openclaw`, `codebuddy`, `workbuddy`, and others — run `skb install --help` for the full list.

### Install a Collection

Collections are admin-curated flat packs (e.g. "frontend team essentials"), not a folder tree. One command downloads the collection zip and installs all member skills.

```bash
skb install --collection <id_or_slug>
skb install --collection 1 --ide cursor
skb install --collection frontend-team --ide cursor
```

- `target` (skill id) and `--collection` are mutually exclusive
- On name conflicts, CLI lists all conflicting paths and asks once whether to overwrite all; cancel skips the entire collection install

## Manage Local Installs

```bash
skb list                              # or: skb ls
skb update <skill_id>
skb update <skill_id> -d <directory>
skb delete <skill_id>                 # or: skb rm
skb delete <skill_id> --all
skb delete <skill_id> -d <directory> -y
```

- `skb install` records install path, version, timestamp, IDE type, and global flag in `~/.skill-base/config.json`
- `skb list` / `skb ls` aggregate by skill (most recent first); pick one to update, delete local files, or clear records only
- `skb update <skill_id>` shows versions with changelog and uploader, then multi-select recorded install directories (or updates directly when only one exists)
- `skb update <skill_id> -d <directory>` bypasses records and updates `<directory>/<skill_id>` directly
- `skb delete <skill_id>` lists recorded install directories for multi-select (or `--all` / `-d` / `-y` for scripting); only removes paths whose directory name matches `skill_id`

## Publish

- **Skill name must pass `/^[\w-]+$/` validation, e.g., skill-base-cli**
- Prepare content in a **folder named after the skill**, root directory must contain **`SKILL.md`**
- **Recommended**: Use frontmatter in SKILL.md to mark name and description as the skill name and description
- If SKILL.md frontmatter has a name field, it must match the folder name
- If **no frontmatter is used**: Use the folder name as the skill name; the first paragraph of non-`#` text under the title is the skill description (can be overridden with `--description`)
- Execute in the skill directory: `skb publish`; or execute from any location: `skb publish <skill_folder_path>`
- Common usage: `skb publish <path> --changelog "description"`
- After publishing, describe the result to the user in 2 sentences, no need to be verbose

## Import from GitHub (public repos, skill-base login required)

- `skb import-github owner/repo` or `skb import https://github.com/owner/repo`,like `https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/pdf`
- Same auth as publish (`skb login`)
- Options: `--ref`, `--subpath`, `--target <skill_id>`, `--changelog`, `--dry-run` (preview JSON only)
- Server downloads the repo archive; private repos are not supported

## Troubleshooting Failures

- First confirm **`SKB_BASE_URL`** points to the instance the user wants to use, as skill-base can be deployed internally and ports can be changed, verify the address is correct
- If the user deployed skill-base on a server, most servers need inbound/outbound port configuration to be accessible, users need to check if the address is accessible in the browser
- Check if it's a network issue, can use ping/telnet to confirm
- Publish failure: First **`skb login`**; then verify **`SKB_BASE_URL`**, folder name and frontmatter **`name`** are consistent and match `[\w-]+`, check `SKILL.md` and network
- Install failure: Use **`skb search`** to verify `skill_id`; when unsure of version, use `skb install <skill_id>` to install latest
