# ConnectWise PSA  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `connectwise-manage-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/connectwise-manage/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/connectwise-manage/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `connectwise-manage-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `connectwise-manage-cli` and `connectwise-manage-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

A spec-generated CLI over the ConnectWise Manage REST API covering tickets, time, companies, contacts, agreements, configurations, projects, opportunities, and members. It syncs the high-gravity entities into a local SQLite store so you get instant full-text search and cross-table views the PSA never surfaces in one place  -  `unbilled` reconciles tickets against logged time, `account` assembles a full company 360, `board`/`stale`/`workload` give a dispatcher's queue at a glance. Every command speaks `--json`/`--select` and the whole tree is exposed as an MCP server for AI-driven triage.

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI when an MSP task touches the ConnectWise PSA system-of-record from the terminal or an agent: triaging or updating service tickets, logging billable time, pulling company / contact / agreement context, checking the CMDB, or reconciling unbilled work and agreement burn. It is the right choice when you want offline-fast queries, cross-entity views the web UI can't compose, or an MCP surface over the PSA. It is not the right choice for ConnectWise Automate (RMM) or for tenant administration screens the REST API doesn't cover.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local joins that compound
- **`unbilled`**  -  Find tickets you touched or closed in a window that have zero or under-threshold time logged against them.

  _Reach for this before a billing cutoff or at end-of-day to catch revenue leaking from unlogged time._

  ```bash
  connectwise-manage-cli unbilled --since 7d --agent
  ```
- **`account`**  -  One card for a company: contacts, active agreements, deployed configurations, open-ticket count, and last activity.

  _Use it to prep a QBR or to get full context before any escalation call without clicking through tabs._

  ```bash
  connectwise-manage-cli account "Acme Corp" --agent
  ```
- **`agreement-burn`**  -  Hours logged against an agreement's company in a period versus the agreement's allotment, as a utilization percentage with over/under flag.

  _Use it to spot unprofitable clients before they blow their block-hours._

  ```bash
  connectwise-manage-cli agreement-burn --period 30d --agent
  ```

### Dispatcher views
- **`board`**  -  Open tickets on a board, oldest first, with each ticket's age, owner, status, and priority joined from the synced reference data.

  _Reach for this for the morning queue sweep instead of reloading the web board view._

  ```bash
  connectwise-manage-cli board 2 --unassigned
  ```
- **`stale`**  -  Open tickets with no update in N days, oldest first, with board and owner columns so you see what's rotting and whose it is.

  _Use it for the daily 'what's rotting on my board' pass before standup._

  ```bash
  connectwise-manage-cli stale --days 5
  ```
- **`workload`**  -  Open ticket count and aging per tech, so you route the next ticket to whoever is lightest.

  _Reach for this when deciding who should take a new escalation._

  ```bash
  connectwise-manage-cli workload --agent
  ```

### Query ergonomics
- **`condition`**  -  Build a validated ConnectWise conditions expression from flags (handling string quoting, bracketed dates, and AND-default / OR-parentheses), or explain what an existing expression queries.

  _Use it whenever a list command returns surprisingly empty  -  the DSL's quoting and AND/OR rules are the usual culprit._

  ```bash
  connectwise-manage-cli condition build --field board/name --op = --value "Help Desk"
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
connectwise-manage-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Triage new tickets, agent-friendly

```bash
connectwise-manage-cli service get-tickets --conditions 'status/name="New"' --agent --select id,summary,board.name,company.identifier,owner.identifier
```

Narrows the deeply-nested ticket payload to the five fields an agent actually needs, so it doesn't burn context parsing the full record.

### Find unbilled work before the billing cutoff

```bash
connectwise-manage-cli unbilled --since 7d --agent
```

Lists tickets touched this week with zero or under-threshold time logged  -  the join the PSA won't give you.

### Account 360 before a QBR

```bash
connectwise-manage-cli account "Acme Corp" --agent
```

One card with contacts, active agreements, deployed configurations, and open-ticket count instead of five web screens.

### Build a safe conditions filter

```bash
connectwise-manage-cli condition build --field board/id --op in --value 2,3 --field status/name --op = --value New
```

Emits a validated conditions string (correct quoting, AND join) you can paste into any list command.

### Large / historical tenant: keep sync and reads fast

On a tenant with years of history, a plain `sync` is expensive: ConnectWise list endpoints declare no "changed since" parameter, so every sync re-fetches each resource in full (you'll see `resource_not_incremental` warnings) and `--since` has **no effect on the sync itself**. Use these levers:

- **Scope the sync with a conditions filter** so it fetches only a working window instead of the whole history. `sync` takes no resource positional: name the resource with `--resources` and attach the condition with `--resource-param <resource>:<key>=<value>` (repeat the pair per high-volume resource). Build the expression with `condition build` first:

  ```bash
  connectwise-manage-cli sync --resources service-tickets --resource-param "service-tickets:conditions=lastUpdated > [2025-01-01T00:00:00Z]"
  ```

- **Keep reads local.** The cross-entity views (`unbilled`, `account`, `agreement-burn`, `board`, `stale`, `workload`) read the local mirror. `search` defaults to auto mode (it tries the live API first); add `--data-source local` and/or `--type <resource>` to stay fully offline. If a command exceeds its default timeout on a big tenant, give it more room with `--timeout 2m`.
- **On the MCP server**, the `search` tool is already local-only and bounded; run the other commands via `connectwise-manage_execute` and add the same `--param` / `--data-source local` / `--timeout` flags when the tenant is large.

## Auth Setup

ConnectWise Manage uses HTTP Basic auth with a twist: the username is the composite `companyId+publicKey` and the password is the `privateKey`, plus a `clientId` GUID header is required on every call (registered at developer.connectwise.com). Set CW_COMPANY_ID, CW_PUBLIC_KEY, CW_PRIVATE_KEY, and CW_CLIENT_ID; set CW_SITE to your region host (api-na, api-eu, api-au) or your on-prem host. Run `doctor` to validate all four credentials and reachability before anything else.

Run `connectwise-manage-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  connectwise-manage-cli project get --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
connectwise-manage-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
connectwise-manage-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
connectwise-manage-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/connectwise-manage-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `CONNECTWISE_MANAGE_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `CONNECTWISE_MANAGE_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
connectwise-manage-cli profile save briefing --json
connectwise-manage-cli --profile briefing project get
connectwise-manage-cli profile list --json
connectwise-manage-cli profile show briefing
connectwise-manage-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `connectwise-manage-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add connectwise-manage-mcp -- connectwise-manage-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which connectwise-manage-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   connectwise-manage-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `connectwise-manage-cli <command> --help`.
