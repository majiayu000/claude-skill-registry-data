# Citation Verification with Gemini File Search

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

Scan pandoc-flavored markdown drafts for citations, upload source PDFs to a Gemini File Search store, and verify each citation is grounded in its source. Produces a structured REVIEW-CITES.md report.

## Prerequisites

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` env var set (Google AI Studio; on this machine: `export GOOGLE_API_KEY="$(cat $GEMINI_API_KEY_FILE)"`)
- Bun runtime
- `rclone` with a `google-drive:` remote configured (used to bypass Google Drive FUSE deadlocks)
- `python3` with `pymupdf4llm` installed (used for PDF text extraction in passage grounding)
- `readwise` CLI installed and authenticated (for Readwise article export in source materialization)
- One or more `.bib` files with `file` fields mapping bibkeys to PDF paths (e.g., Paperpile's `paperpile.bib`)

## Source Materialization

Before running cite-check, materialize all sources locally:

```bash
cd ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}
bun materialize-sources.ts \
  --bib ~/Google\ Drive/My\ Drive/resources/Paperpile/paperpile.bib \
  --bib ./references/sources.bib \
  --refs ./references \
  --drafts ./drafts \
  --debug
```

This populates `references/` with local copies of all cited sources:
- **Paperpile PDFs** → batch `rclone copy` from Google Drive → `references/<bibkey>.pdf`
- **Readwise articles** (reports, news, speeches without PDFs) → search by title, export markdown → `references/<bibkey>.md`
- **Gaps** → printed at the end for manual action (Obsidian web clipper or manual sourcing)

After materialization, cite-check operates purely locally.

## Usage

```bash
cd ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}
bun install  # first time only

# Single bib file
bun cite-check.ts --bib ~/Google\ Drive/My\ Drive/resources/Paperpile/paperpile.bib --drafts <path-to-drafts>

# Multiple bib files (Paperpile + project-local; first bib wins on duplicate keys)
bun cite-check.ts \
  --bib ~/Google\ Drive/My\ Drive/resources/Paperpile/paperpile.bib \
  --bib ./references/sources.bib \
  --drafts <path-to-drafts>
```

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--bib <path>` | Yes* | -- | Path to .bib file (repeatable; first wins on duplicate keys) |
| `--store <id>` | No | auto-create | Use existing File Search store ID |
| `--drafts <dir>` | No | `./drafts` | Directory with markdown draft files |
| `--out <path>` | No | `<drafts>/REVIEW-CITES.md` | Output report path |
| `--limit <n>` | No | all | Check only first N citations (smoke test) |
| `--dry-run` | No | false | Print prompts without querying |
| `--sequential` | No | false | Run queries one-at-a-time instead of Batch API (default: batch) |
| `--retry-model <model>` | No | the `pro` role | Retry UNSUPPORTED results with a stronger model |
| `--audit` | No | false | Audit source availability without querying (checks Paperpile PDFs) |
| `--debug` | No | false | Verbose logging |

*Either `--bib` or `--store` is required.

### Ask Mode: Targeted Source Queries

Ask a specific question about a single source:

```bash
# Does Bebchuk2019 support a specific claim?
bun cite-check.ts ask @Bebchuk2019-uq "do expense ratios fall since 2010?" --bib paperpile.bib

# What does a source say about a topic?
bun cite-check.ts ask @Brav2022-ht "what are retail turnout rates?" --bib paperpile.bib --bib sources.bib
```

The `ask` mode uploads the single source PDF via the legacy Files API (with manifest caching, 48h TTL), queries Gemini with inline file references, and prints the answer with supporting passages to stdout. No File Search store is created and no report is generated.

### Cross-Directory File Resolution

When multiple `--bib` files are provided, file paths are resolved across all bib directories. This handles the common case where a project-local `sources.bib` has `file = {All Papers/...}` paths that are relative to the Paperpile folder rather than the project's `references/` directory. The tool tries each bib directory as a fallback when the primary path doesn't exist on disk.

## How It Works

1. **Extract citations** from markdown using pandoc `[@bibkey]` syntax
2. **Parse bib file** to map bibkeys to PDF file paths via `file` fields
3. **Sync the File Search Store, per file** — PDFs for cited bibkeys are imported into a persistent Gemini File Search store with bibkey metadata. Google Drive FUSE paths are copied locally via `rclone` to avoid EDEADLK deadlocks. Stores persist across runs (no 48h TTL). "Changed" means the SHA-256 of the **bytes** of a cited source differs — not just its bibkey or path — so swapping a PDF at the same path under the same bibkey (a working paper replaced by the published version) invalidates it. A missing or unreadable source hashes to a `<missing>` sentinel rather than erroring; coverage is reported separately.

   State (`.cite-check-store.json`, in the drafts directory) records a **per-bibkey** hash, so invalidation is surgical rather than whole-store: one swapped PDF among 46 re-imports one document, not 46. The run takes one of three paths and always logs which and why on stderr:

   - `[store] REUSE` — no cited source changed; zero API calls.
   - `[store] SURGICAL` — changed and removed keys have their document deleted, then changed and added keys are imported. Delete comes first, so a failed import leaves the key **absent** from the store and it reports NOT_IN_STORE rather than being verified against stale bytes. Documents are located by paginating `documents.list` and matching `customMetadata.bibkey` — never `displayName`, which the store replaces with a random id on import.
   - `[store] FULL REBUILD` — the store is deleted and everything re-imported. This is the fallback for anything that leaves the store's contents unknowable: no prior state, state written before per-key hashes existed (a one-time migration), a `documents.list` failure, a key the state claims was imported but no document carries, or a failed delete. A silent partial update is the failure mode this guards against, so the reason is always printed.
4. **Query Gemini** with structured prompts for each citation, using the `fileSearch` tool with metadata filtering to scope each query to the relevant source documents
5. **Classify** each citation as SUPPORTED / PARTIAL / UNSUPPORTED / NOT_IN_STORE / ERROR
6. **Verify grounding** — for SUPPORTED/PARTIAL results, extract source PDF text via `pymupdf4llm` and run token-level LCS alignment to confirm the passage Gemini quoted actually exists in the source. Ungrounded passages are flagged `[UNGROUNDED]` in the report.
7. **Write report** to REVIEW-CITES.md

### Bib File Format

The `--bib` flag expects a `.bib` file where entries have a `file` field with a path relative to the bib file's directory. Paperpile's exported `paperpile.bib` follows this convention:

```bibtex
@article{Hu2024-bm,
  author = {Edwin Hu and ...},
  title = {{Custom proxy voting advice}},
  file = {All Papers/H/Hu et al. 2024 - Custom proxy voting advice.pdf},
  year = {2024}
}
```

All bib entries are parsed. Entries with a `file` field (~95% of Paperpile entries) are imported into the File Search store. Only sources for bibkeys that are actually cited in the drafts are imported.

### Citation Features

- Bracketed `[@key]` and in-text `@key` citations
- Locators: `[@key, p. 42]`
- Compound cites: `[@a; @b]` (queried together)
- Footnote indirection: citations in `[^id]:` footnote bodies
- Bluebook signals: `see`, `cf.`, `see also`, etc. (softens verification)
- Parenthetical extraction: `[@key] (holding that X)`

## Output

REVIEW-CITES.md with:
- Summary counts (supported/partial/unsupported/not in store/error/ungrounded)
- Details table: status, file:line, bibkey, claim, response
- `[UNGROUNDED]` flag on any SUPPORTED/PARTIAL result whose passage failed grounding verification

## Batch Mode (Default)

By default, all citation queries are submitted as a single Gemini Batch API job using the File Search tool with metadata filtering. Each query is scoped to the relevant source documents via bibkey metadata, so there is no cross-contamination between queries.

```bash
# Default (batch)
bun cite-check.ts --bib paperpile.bib --drafts ./drafts

# Sequential (one query at a time, useful for debugging)
bun cite-check.ts --bib paperpile.bib --drafts ./drafts --sequential
```

The `--sequential` flag runs each query as an individual `generateContent` call instead of a batch job. This is useful for debugging or when batch jobs hit rate limits.

## Audit Mode

Run `--audit` before checking citations to see which sources are available and which need to be added:

```bash
bun cite-check.ts --bib paperpile.bib --bib sources.bib --drafts ./drafts --audit
```

The audit checks each cited bibkey for PDF availability on disk (via bib `file` field with cross-directory resolution). Missing sources should be added to Paperpile.

Exit code is 1 if any sources are missing, 0 if all sources are available. No Gemini store is created and no queries are sent.

## Passage Grounding

After Gemini returns a SUPPORTED/PARTIAL result with a `supporting_passage`, the tool verifies the passage actually exists in the source PDF text using token-level LCS alignment (ported from [langextract](https://github.com/google/langextract)'s WordAligner). Two gates reject bad matches:

- **Coverage gate** (default 0.75): at least 75% of passage tokens must appear in the matched source span
- **Density gate** (default 0.33): matched tokens must be at least 33% of the source span length (rejects scattered matches)

Signal cites (`see`, `cf.`, etc.) use relaxed thresholds (0.5 coverage / 0.2 density) since they only need conceptual alignment.

Grounding requires extracting text from the source PDF. This uses `pymupdf4llm` (via `extract-pdf-text.py`) which preserves document structure, footnotes, and tables as clean markdown. Extracted text is cached in `<drafts>/.cite-check-text/`.

> The Gemini File Search API behind the primary grounding signal — store creation, metadata filtering, and the `groundingMetadata` shape `grounding.ts` parses — is documented in `skills/gemini-batch/references/file-search.md`.

## Google Drive FUSE Bypass

PDF files stored on Google Drive Desktop's FUSE mount (`~/Google Drive/My Drive/`) are subject to EDEADLK deadlocks when accessed concurrently or when not locally cached. The tool detects Google Drive paths — including through symlinks (e.g., `references/All Papers → ~/Google Drive/.../Paperpile/All Papers`) — and uses `rclone copyto` to fetch them to a local cache (`~/.cache/cite-check-pdfs/`) before upload or text extraction. Requires `rclone` with a `google-drive:` remote configured.

## Architecture

```
cite-extract.ts          -- Pure citation extraction (no I/O)
gemini.ts                -- Gemini API wrapper (File Search store CRUD, query, legacy upload for ask mode, rclone FUSE bypass)
grounding.ts             -- Post-hoc passage grounding (tokenizer, LCS aligner)
extract-pdf-text.py      -- PDF text extraction via pymupdf4llm
materialize-sources.ts   -- Copy Paperpile PDFs + Readwise articles to references/
cite-check.ts            -- CLI orchestrator (extract -> import -> query -> ground -> report)
```
