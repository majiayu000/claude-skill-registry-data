# HubSpot  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `hubspot-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/hubspot/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/hubspot/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `hubspot-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `hubspot-cli` and `hubspot-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

A local SQLite data layer no other HubSpot tool has: HubSpot's own CLI (`hs`) only covers CMS  -  there has never been a sales/CRM CLI from HubSpot itself. This one mirrors your CRM into local SQLite so commands like `nurture-mine`, `stale deals`, `owner-load`, and `pipeline-health` answer cross-table questions instantly and offline. New in this reprint: `sync --with-history` persists per-property snapshots into a shared property-history table, and `meetings ever-had` / `meetings status-report` answer questions HubSpot's standard search API physically cannot  -  'every meeting that was EVER status X in month Y, even after it flipped.'

## When to Use This CLI

Use hubspot-cli whenever an agent or human needs Sales Hub data without paying for a live API round trip per query. It is the right pick for nurture loops, pipeline-health dashboards, stale-prospect detection, bulk property updates from CSV, monthly property-history reports (`meetings status-report`, `meetings ever-had`), and any cross-object join (engagements × deals × owners) that the HubSpot web UI cannot answer in one screen. ANTI-TRIGGERS  -  do NOT use this CLI for: HubSpot CMS / themes / serverless functions (use the official `hs` CLI), Marketing emails / campaigns / forms / ads, Conversations / Inbox / Support workflows, Commerce Hub (orders / invoices / subscriptions / payments / carts / contracts).

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds

- **`stale`**  -  Find contacts or deals with no engagement in N days, scoped by owner or pipeline stage  -  instantly, offline.

  _Use this when the user asks 'what's gone cold'  -  works after one sync, no API quota burn._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli stale deals --days 21 --owner me --json
  ```
- **`owner-load`**  -  Open deals per rep per pipeline stage with $ totals, count, and oldest-deal age  -  the Monday-morning sales-lead report.

  _Pick this over per-rep API calls when surfacing 'who has too many in-flight deals' or 'where is rep capacity hot'._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli owner-load --pipeline default --json
  ```
- **`pipeline-health`**  -  Per-stage rollup of count, $ total, $ at risk (idle deals near their close date), and the oldest-stuck deal  -  one query for a sales-ops dashboard. Closed Lost weighted at probability 0, Closed Won at 1.0.

  _Use this for forecast-vs-reality checks before a pipeline review._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli pipeline-health default --idle-days 14 --json
  ```
- **`nurture queue`**  -  Ranked 'who to contact today' list scored by stale-days × deal amount × stage probability, with the rationale exposed as columns.

  _Reach for this in the nurture skill or any daily-touch-list loop where an agent needs a priority order with reasons attached._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli nurture queue --owner me --top 20 --agent
  ```
- **`deals top`**  -  Composite-ranked top-N deals by (signal × amount × stage-probability × inverse-days-since-contact) with the score breakdown exposed as columns.

  _Pick this for sales-lead Monday reviews or when an agent needs the top opportunities ranked by signal-weighted score, not raw amount._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli deals top --top 5 --pipeline default --json
  ```

### Property history & audit

- **`meetings history`**  -  Show the full timeline of property changes for a single meeting (outcome, title, owner, custom fields)  -  when each value was set, by whom, and from what source.

  _Reach for this when investigating 'when did this meeting flip from Scheduled to No Show, and who changed it'. Requires a prior 'sync --resources hubspot-meetings-crm --with-history <props>' to populate the history table._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli meetings history 53612340987612345 --json
  ```
- **`meetings ever-had`**  -  Find every meeting whose given property was EVER set to a given value within a date range  -  even if it has since changed.

  _Pick this when a customer or audit asks 'every meeting that was at some point in status X during month Y'. Requires a prior 'sync --with-history' capture; the standard /search API cannot answer it._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli meetings ever-had --property hs_meeting_outcome --value Scheduled --from 2026-04-01 --to 2026-04-30 --json
  ```
- **`meetings status-report`**  -  Composes the meetings ever-had query into the canonical monthly-report shape: every meeting that touched the given status in the given month, with owner, title, current status, and the timestamp of the original status set.

  _Use this once per month per customer report  -  one command replaces a Python pull + a HubSpot export + a manual cross-reference. Requires a prior 'sync --resources hubspot-meetings-crm --with-history hs_meeting_outcome'._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli meetings status-report --status scheduled --month 2026-04 --csv
  ```
- **`sync --with-history`**  -  Opt-in sync flag that requests propertiesWithHistory for the named properties on meetings (and on deals, contacts, companies when scoped to those). Persists per-property snapshots into the shared hubspot_property_history table.

  _Reach for this when you need property change history retained. Without --with-history sync only captures current values; with it, every read after that point can answer 'was this property ever value X' questions._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli sync --resources hubspot-meetings-crm --with-history hs_meeting_outcome,hs_meeting_title,hubspot_owner_id
  ```
- **`deals velocity`**  -  Per-deal days-in-current-stage and per-stage median/p90 dwell time, computed from dealstage change history  -  find where deals rot.

  _Use this when the user asks where deals stall or how long deals sit per stage  -  requires a prior sync deals --with-history dealstage._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli deals velocity --pipeline default --json
  ```

### Cross-object intelligence

- **`engagements of`**  -  Unified chronological timeline of every call, email, meeting, note, and task touching a contact, deal, or company.

  _Use this when an agent or human asks 'what touched this prospect/deal'  -  one command instead of five paginated API calls._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli engagements of contact:12345 --since 30d --json
  ```
- **`notes signals`**  -  Scan note bodies for buying / lost signals (meeting scheduled, budget approved, no response, competitor chosen) and emit per-deal signal counts with the source note id.

  _Use this when summarizing what's heating up or cooling off in the pipeline without re-reading every note._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli notes signals --pipeline default --since 30d --json
  ```
- **`since`**  -  What changed across contacts, deals, and engagements since a given timestamp  -  agent-friendly cross-object delta.

  _Reach for this in agent loops that need to react to CRM activity since the last run without paginating every collection._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli since 24h --types deals,engagements --owner me --json
  ```
- **`contacts funnel`**  -  One-shot funnel table of contacts per lifecycle stage (subscriber → lead → MQL → SQL → opportunity → customer) with stage-to-stage conversion ratios.

  _Use this for 'where is the top of funnel leaking' questions  -  instant offline funnel snapshot after one sync._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli contacts funnel --json
  ```
- **`deals unowned`**  -  Open deals with no owner or owned by a deactivated rep, with per-stage dollar exposure  -  the hygiene gap owner-load can't see.

  _Use this in the weekly hygiene pass to find orphaned deals before they rot  -  distinct from owner-load, which only aggregates owned deals._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli deals unowned --pipeline default --json
  ```
- **`contacts win-back`**  -  Contacts attached to a Closed Won deal but with no engagement in N days  -  the customer-expansion and re-engage list.

  _Use this for post-win expansion outreach  -  distinct from nurture-mine (open-deal cold) and stale (any cold)._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli contacts win-back --cold-days 90 --json
  ```
- **`deals forecast`**  -  Probability-weighted pipeline forecast bucketed by close-date month  -  the canonical GM revenue question, answered offline.

  _Use this for close-month weighted totals for revenue reviews; pipeline-health answers per-stage risk, forecast answers per-month expectation._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli deals forecast --pipeline default --json
  ```

### Bulk operations

- **`nurture-mine`**  -  Surface the contacts assigned to you that have gone cold but still have open deals  -  the daily 'who do I call' list, computed across local SQLite.

  _Reach for this when an agent or human needs the daily Titans-style nurture queue without round-tripping HubSpot for every prospect._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli nurture-mine --owner me --stale-days 14 --agent
  ```
- **`contacts bulk-update`**  -  Apply a CSV of property changes to many contacts at once, pre-validating each row against HubSpot's property schema (types, picklists) before any mutation.

  _Pick this over the HubSpot UI when sales-ops needs to update hundreds of contacts and demands a pre-flight error report rather than silent failures._

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli contacts bulk-update --from-csv people.csv --map email=Email,lifecyclestage=Stage --dry-run
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
hubspot-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query. `--json` (and other machine formats) keep that exit-2 contract and write `{"matches":[]}` on stdout so agents can inspect the envelope without treating a miss as success.

## Recipes


### Monthly customer report  -  every meeting EVER scheduled in April

```bash
hubspot-cli sync --resources hubspot-meetings-crm --with-history hs_meeting_outcome,hs_meeting_title,hubspot_owner_id && hubspot-cli meetings status-report --status scheduled --month 2026-04 --csv > april-scheduled.csv
```

Two commands: refresh meetings with property history retained, then emit the canonical CSV the customer expects. Includes every meeting that was set to Scheduled at any point in April, even if it later flipped to No Show or Completed  -  only the property-history snapshot table can answer this.

### Investigate a single meeting's status history

```bash
hubspot-cli meetings ever-had --property hs_meeting_outcome --value Scheduled --from 2026-04-01 --to 2026-04-30 --agent --select id,property,value,timestamp,source_type --json
```

Find every meeting touching status Scheduled in April; agent-friendly dotted-path --select keeps only the columns the agent needs, --agent enables compact output.

### Today's nurture queue for me

```bash
hubspot-cli nurture queue --owner me --top 20 --agent
```

Ranked daily contact list with stale-days, deal $, and stage probability columns  -  drop straight into `/nurture today`.

### Cross-object timeline for a deal

```bash
hubspot-cli engagements of deal:1234567 --since 90d --json --select id,type,timestamp,subject,from_owner
```

Every call, email, meeting, note, and task touching the deal in the last 90 days  -  one query replaces five paginated API calls; --select keeps the agent context tight.

### Find every cold deal in my pipeline

```bash
hubspot-cli stale deals --days 21 --owner me --json --select id,name,amount,stage,idle_days
```

Open deals that have not had an engagement in 21 days, scoped to me, with only the fields an agent needs.

### Bulk-update lifecycle stage from a campaign CSV

```bash
hubspot-cli contacts bulk-update --from-csv titans.csv --map email=email,lifecyclestage=Stage --dry-run
```

Validate the CSV against the local properties schema before any write; drop --dry-run when the report is clean.

## Auth Setup

Authenticate with a HubSpot Private App access token (prefix `pat-…`). Create one at https://app.hubspot.com/private-apps with CRM read+write scopes, then export it as `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`. The token's scopes determine which commands work  -  `doctor` reports them.

Run `hubspot-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color`.

Global format flags share one contract on promoted, novel, sync, and `--deliver` paths:

- `--json`  -  one JSON document on stdout (sync progress events go to stderr)
- `--compact`  -  keep identity/status/timestamp fields; does not change the document vs stream shape
- `--csv` / `--plain`  -  tabular rows (collection envelopes unwrap to the row array)
- `--quiet`  -  one identity value per row, no envelope

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  hubspot-cli crm get-v4-objects-object-type-object-id-associations-to-object-type-get-page mock-value mock-value mock-value --agent --select paging,results
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit confirmation**  -  `--agent` does not imply `--yes`; pass `--yes` separately only after the target, arguments, and side effects are clear
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and use `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Paths and state

Agents should treat the CLI's path resolver as part of the runtime contract:

- Use `--home <dir>` for one invocation, or set `HUBSPOT_HOME=<dir>` to relocate all four path kinds under one root.
- Use per-kind env vars only when a specific kind must diverge: `HUBSPOT_CONFIG_DIR`, `HUBSPOT_DATA_DIR`, `HUBSPOT_STATE_DIR`, `HUBSPOT_CACHE_DIR`.
- Resolution order is per-kind env var, `--home`, `HUBSPOT_HOME`, XDG (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`), then platform defaults.
- `config` contains settings like `config.toml` and profiles. `data` contains `credentials.toml`, `data.db`, cookies, and auth sidecars. `state` contains persisted queries, jobs, and `teach.log`. `cache` contains regenerable HTTP/cache files.
- Stored secrets live in `credentials.toml` under the data dir. Existing legacy `config.toml` secrets are read for compatibility and leave `config.toml` on the first auth write.
- Run `hubspot-cli doctor --fail-on warn` to surface path and credential-location warnings. `agent-context` exposes a schema v4 `paths` block for agents that need the resolved dirs.
- For MCP, pass relocation through the MCP host config. The MCP binary does not inherit CLI flags:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "hubspot": {
        "command": "hubspot-mcp",
        "env": {
          "HUBSPOT_HOME": "/srv/hubspot"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

Fleet precedence: an inherited per-kind env var overrides an explicit `--home` for that kind. Use `HUBSPOT_HOME` or per-kind vars as durable fleet levers, and use `--home` only for a single invocation. Relocation is not reversible by unsetting env vars; move files manually before clearing `HUBSPOT_HOME`, or `doctor` will not find credentials left under the former root.

## Automatic learning

This CLI ships a self-capturing learning loop. The CLI does its own bookkeeping: every invocation is journaled locally, a failed flag followed by a corrected retry auto-derives a `flag_alias` candidate, and a `teach` on a query family without a playbook auto-synthesizes a `playbook_candidate` from the session's journal. Your job is judgment only: `recall` first, act on surfaced candidates, `teach` the final answer, `playbook amend` when you observe a correction. You never record failures by hand.

### Step 1: `recall` before any discovery

Before list/search/drill commands on a new user question, pass the question as an argv or MCP tool argument to `recall --agent`. Do not interpolate user-controlled text into a shell command line.

Quoted `recall "<question>"` breaks on an apostrophe, which is ordinary English. A quoted heredoc breaks when a body line equals the delimiter, and that delimiter is published in these docs. Write the question with a non-shell file-writing tool, then read it back as data:

```bash
# Write the question verbatim with your file-writing tool (no shell involved).
# Command substitution on a file only ever yields data  -  the shell never
# parses the file's bytes as syntax.
QUERY=$(cat /path/to/question.txt)
hubspot-cli recall "$QUERY" --agent
```

Prefer MCP: pass the question as the tool's query argument. `"$QUERY"` after a file read is argv-safe; putting the question itself in the command text is not.

The response envelope:

```json
{
  "query": "...",
  "normalized": "<normalized form>",
  "query_entities": ["..."],
  "found": true | false,
  "match_score": 0.0,
  "results": [
    { "resource_id": "...", "resource_type": "...", "venue": "...",
      "confidence": 2, "entity_match": "exact|partial|unknown",
      "source": "taught|preseed|pattern", "warnings": ["..."] }
  ],
  "mismatches": [ /* only when --debug-mismatches */ ],
  "warnings": [ /* top-level */ ],
  "candidates": [
    { "id": 12, "class": "flag_alias | playbook_candidate",
      "summary": "...", "sightings": 3, "last_seen": "...",
      "rationale": "...",
      "next_action": ["<trial command>", "hubspot-cli learnings confirm 12"] }
  ],
  "playbook": {
    "query_family": "...",
    "playbook": {
      "steps": [ { "cmd": "<command with {slot} substitution>", "purpose": "..." } ],
      "entity_slots": ["$ENTITY"],
      "expected_tool_calls": 3
    },
    "slots_resolved": { "$ENTITY": { "token": "<live token>", "canonical": "<canonical>" } },
    "notes": "<workarounds + gotchas for this query family>"
  },
  "notes": "<duplicate surface for non-playbook callers>"
}
```

Empty-store short-circuit: if the store has no learnings, playbooks, or candidates yet (recall finds nothing and `learnings list` and `learnings candidates` are both empty), skip recall for the rest of this session instead of taxing every query; resume recall-first once something has been taught.

### Step 2: decision tree

Read `candidates`, `playbook`, `notes`, `results[0]`, and warnings in that order:

```
if Candidates present (warnings include "candidates_present"):
    -> candidates are try-then-confirm, never facts. Follow each candidate's
       two-step next_action verbatim: run the trial command first, then run
       `learnings confirm <id>` only after the trial verified the behavior.
       Reject a wrong candidate with `learnings reject <id>`.
    -> NEVER re-teach something recall surfaced as a candidate; confirm or
       reject that candidate instead of teaching a duplicate.
    -> candidates ride alongside playbooks and resource hits, not instead of
       them; continue with the branches below after acting on them.

if Playbook present:
    -> READ Playbook.notes verbatim FIRST (workarounds + gotchas the CLI surface doesn't expose)
    -> replay Playbook.steps in order, substituting Playbook.slots_resolved entries
       for the entity slot tokens. If a step's slot is unresolved, fall back to
       discovery for that step only.
    -> the Playbook's expected_tool_calls is a budget; if you find yourself running
       materially more, record the divergence via `hubspot-cli playbook amend`
       at end-of-session.

elif Notes present (no Playbook):
    -> read Notes verbatim before any discovery step; they carry known gotchas
       for this query family even when no structured choreography exists yet.

elif Found AND Results[0].EntityMatch == "exact" AND Results[0].Confidence >= 2:
    -> skip discovery; fetch live data for Results[*].ResourceID in parallel

elif Found AND Results[0].EntityMatch == "partial":
    -> candidate hint, NOT a hit; read the resource title to validate before trusting

elif (any row in Mismatches[] when --debug-mismatches was passed):
    -> treat as cold start; the stored learning is for a different entity
       (different canonical resolved from query_entities)

else:  // Found == false, no playbook, no notes
    -> cold start; run discovery normally; teach the answer afterward (Step 4).
       If the family has no playbook yet, that teach auto-synthesizes a
       playbook candidate from this session's journal - you do not need to
       record one by hand.
```

Playbook and Notes are orthogonal to the per-resource path. A recall response can carry both a Playbook AND a `Results[]` hit - use both: the Playbook tells you which choreography to run; the resource hits short-circuit specific steps. Default to skipping `mismatches`; pass `--debug-mismatches` only when investigating cold-start surprises.

Candidate judgment details: `learnings confirm <id>` prints the candidate's full payload before materializing it - check that the printed payload matches the behavior you verified. `learnings reject <id>` tombstones the derivation signature so the same candidate does not resurface. The envelope carries only the few candidates worth acting on now; `hubspot-cli learnings candidates` lists the full open set.

Graceful degradation: if `learnings confirm` is an unknown command, you are driving an older binary - ignore the candidates guidance and follow the rest of the protocol.

### Step 3: always read `warnings`

- `low_confidence`: row exists at `confidence<2`. Treat as a hint, not a skip-discovery hit.
- `resource_not_in_store`: the local store doesn't have the resource the learning points at. The match validator couldn't classify entities  -  direct-fetch and re-evaluate.
- `cross_alias_match` (per-result): the row was taught under a different alias and matched the live query's canonical via `entity_lookups` (e.g., a "USA" teach satisfying a "United States" recall). Trust the resource_id.
- `similar_shape_different_entity:<canonical>` (top-level): a structurally matching row exists but its canonical entity differs from the live query's. Treated as cold start; the warning carries the conflicting canonical as a hint, but the row is NOT promoted into Results.
- `ambiguous_alias` (top-level): a single query entity resolved to multiple canonicals (e.g., "Cards" → Arizona Cardinals + St. Louis Cardinals). Surface the ambiguity from context before committing to a resource.
- `candidates_present` (top-level): the envelope carries a `candidates` section. Handle it via the candidates branch in Step 2 before anything else.
- `lookup_refresh_available` (top-level): an entity in the query has no lookup row yet, but synced data could provide one. Run `hubspot-cli sync` to refresh entity lookups.
- Top-level `no_learnings_for_query_family`: the table had no rows above the Jaccard floor. Pure cold start.

### Step 4: `teach &` after finalizing your response - always

Teaching is unconditional. After resolving a query the store could not answer, background-teach the final resource mapping - no call-count threshold, no judging whether it was "worth" learning. The teach is the anchor of the loop: it triggers playbook synthesis for a family without a playbook, and same-referent phrasings fold into one family so near-duplicate teaches do not fragment the store. Fire it after assembling your user-facing response but BEFORE emitting it, with a shell `&` so the call returns immediately. Pass the query the same way as recall  -  argv/MCP, or file-then-`$QUERY`. Do not splice the question into the command text:

```bash
QUERY=$(cat /path/to/question.txt)
hubspot-cli teach --query "$QUERY" --resource-type <type> --resource <id1> --resource <id2>
# (append shell `&` to background it)
```

Silent on success. Errors only land in `teach.log` under the resolved state dir. Teach the **most specific** resource - if the user asked a broad question and you walked through parent records to find the specific answer, teach the leaf id, not the parent. The CLI uses seeded `entity_lookups` for cross-alias resolution at recall time, so a teach under one alias (e.g., "Niners") satisfies future queries under another alias (e.g., "49ers", "San Francisco") automatically.

PII rule: teach the structural question with identifiers stripped - never include names, emails, phone numbers, account ids, or other personal identifiers in taught queries or notes. The CLI scans teach queries for obvious email/phone shapes and warns, but does not block; strip before teaching rather than relying on the warning.

### Step 5: playbooks - optional flags, automatic synthesis

You do not need to decide whether a session "deserves" a playbook: a teach on a family without one auto-synthesizes a `playbook_candidate` from the session's journal, and the next session judges it via confirm/reject. Attach explicit playbook flags only when you already hold choreography worth recording verbatim - workarounds the CLI didn't surface (silently-dropped flags, undocumented params, pagination tricks, payload gotchas). Prefer the **integrated one-call form** - record the resource learning and the playbook in the same `teach` invocation:

```bash
# Common case: record both the resource learning AND the playbook in one call.
QUERY=$(cat /path/to/question.txt)
hubspot-cli teach \
  --query "$QUERY" \
  --resource <id> \
  --playbook-file ~/playbooks/<shape>.json \
  --playbook-notes-file ~/playbooks/<shape>-notes.md
# (append shell `&` to background it)

# Alternate: playbook-only (no resource to record alongside).
QUERY=$(cat /path/to/question.txt)
hubspot-cli teach-playbook \
  --query "$QUERY" \
  --playbook-file ~/playbooks/<shape>.json \
  --notes-file ~/playbooks/<shape>-notes.md
```

Playbook files are JSON with `steps`, `entity_slots`, `expected_tool_calls`. Notes files are markdown carrying the gotchas verbatim. File-free callers (MCP-only agents) pass the same content inline: `--playbook-json` and `--playbook-notes` on the integrated `teach` form, `--playbook-json` and `--notes` on `teach-playbook`. On the integrated `teach` form, the playbook flags are optional - omit them entirely for a resource-only teach. On the standalone `teach-playbook` form, at least one of the playbook and notes flags must be set; both empty is rejected. Playbooks are keyed on the structural query family (entities stripped) so a recipe taught from one entity-shaped query applies to every other query of the same shape, with `slots_resolved` binding the live query's canonical at recall time.

When you DO find a playbook on a future recall, treat it as ground truth: replay the steps with `slots_resolved` substitutions, skip the discovery that the choreography already documents, and read `notes` before any step.

### Step 6: `playbook amend &` when your debug response identifies a correction

If your debug-protocol response identifies a concrete correction the notes or playbook should know  -  a workaround, an undocumented endpoint shape, a stale field name, observed schema drift, an empty-payload fallback  -  fire `playbook amend` BEFORE emitting your user-facing response. Same fire-and-forget posture as `teach`. Pass the query and note as argv/MCP arguments, or write each with a non-shell file tool and read them back (`QUERY=$(cat ...)`, `NOTE=$(cat ...)`). Do not interpolate either string into the command text:

```bash
QUERY=$(cat /path/to/question.txt)
NOTE=$(cat /path/to/note.txt)
hubspot-cli playbook amend \
  --query "$QUERY" \
  --add-note "$NOTE"
# (append shell `&` to background it)
```

What counts as worth amending: a behavior you OBSERVED this session that future-you would benefit from knowing. Examples worth amending:

- A workaround for a CLI surface that silently drops or misorders a flag.
- An undocumented endpoint shape (response wrapped in `{meta, results}`, payload nested two levels deeper than the docs claim).
- Observed schema drift (a field renamed, an index that shifted between seasons, a category label that the API now returns lower-cased).

What does NOT belong in notes:

- The year-specific or entity-specific answer to the user's question. That's the response, not a learning.
- Per-team / per-athlete / per-row data the playbook already retrieves at runtime.
- Statements that paraphrase what the existing notes already say.

The amend command appends to the family's existing notes with a timestamped marker (`[amend YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ]: <text>`). Multiple amends accumulate; the audit trail is visible. If no playbook exists yet for the family, amend creates a notes-only one (so cold-start corrections still land).

#### PII discipline for amend notes

`playbook amend` notes are designed to potentially flow upstream as shared knowledge in future versions of the Printing Press. Keep them clean of user-identifying content so the upstream-contribution path stays open without retroactive scrubbing:

- **Do NOT embed** paths to user filesystems, personal API keys or tokens, user email addresses, user GitHub handles, or specific query histories tied to a single user.
- **Acceptable**: endpoint shapes, undocumented field names, API gotchas, observed schema drift, workarounds for CLI surfaces, generalizable pagination or retry tactics.

If a correction is only meaningful with user-specific context, it belongs in a personal note, not in the playbook amend.

### Measuring the loop

`hubspot-cli learnings stats` reports recall hit rate, teach-to-reuse, playbook resolution rate, and candidate confirm/reject counts from the local `learn_events` table. Rates are null until they have a denominator; everything stays on this machine. Use it to check whether the loop is earning its keep for this CLI.

### Disabling learning

- `--no-learn` on a single command short-circuits both `recall` and the `teach` write path. Use for deterministic agent flows or tests that must not be affected by accumulated learnings.
- `HUBSPOT_NO_LEARN=true` in the environment globally disables the pipeline.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
hubspot-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
hubspot-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
hubspot-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally as `feedback.jsonl` under the resolved data dir. They are never POSTed unless `HUBSPOT_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `HUBSPOT_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename). Binary-response commands write decoded payload bytes (not the base64 JSON envelope) and print a small JSON receipt on stdout; `--json`/`--csv` do not refuse when this sink is set. |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled or recurring agent reuses the same saved flags while providing different input each run.

```
hubspot-cli profile save briefing --json
hubspot-cli --profile briefing crm get-v4-objects-object-type-object-id-associations-to-object-type-get-page mock-value mock-value mock-value
hubspot-cli profile list --json
hubspot-cli profile show briefing
hubspot-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 6 | Partial failure |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `hubspot-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add hubspot-mcp -- hubspot-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which hubspot-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   hubspot-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `hubspot-cli <command> --help`.
