# fleet-worker

Run a **cheap headless Claude Code worker on a cheaper model** and let an
Opus orchestrator (this session) fan workers out in parallel, then verify and
land their work. The worker keeps Claude Code's *entire tool harness*
(Read/Write/Edit/Bash/Glob/Grep/Task/MCP/hooks) — only the **brain** is swapped
to a cheaper model via env — a cheaper Anthropic model (Sonnet/Haiku) or a
non-Anthropic endpoint. GLM-5.3 on z.ai is the default worked example; the
mechanism is provider- and model-agnostic (any Anthropic-compatible endpoint).

> **Want to offload to Grok (xAI's `grok` CLI)? That's not this skill.** Every
> fleet-worker brain is a `claude -p` process pointed at an **Anthropic-compatible**
> endpoint. Grok Build CLI is its **own binary and protocol** (`grok -p`, auth via
> `GROK_DEPLOYMENT_KEY`), not a `claude -p` wrapper — so it can't ride fleet-worker's
> launcher. Grok is a first-class worker in **fleetflow** instead (alongside
> Codex), which spawns heterogeneous OS-process workers of different binaries —
> now its own repo at [0xDarkMatter/fleetflow](https://github.com/0xDarkMatter/fleetflow),
> mounted as the `/fleetflow` skill.
> Use fleetflow for a Grok lane or any mixed-provider fan-out.

**This is the spawning layer. [`fleet-ops`](../fleet-ops/) is the landing layer.**
fleet-worker produces branches cheaply; fleet-ops lands them through a test gate
with your review. See [references/fleet-ops-handoff.md](references/fleet-ops-handoff.md).

## The architecture crux: per-agent model = process isolation

`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and the `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` mapping vars are
**process-global** — read once per `claude` process, applied to *every* model
call it makes (including in-process Task subagents). There is no per-agent
override. So you **cannot** keep one Opus session and have its subagents secretly
run on GLM. The only way to pair a GLM-brained agent with an Opus orchestrator is
a **separate OS process** with its own env block. That process is `fleet-worker`.

## The load-bearing rule: auth isolation (do not skip)

On any machine also logged into a Claude.ai/Anthropic subscription, the naïve
"just set `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`" launcher **fails with `401 token expired or
incorrect`** — the host's stored subscription OAuth token (`~/.claude.json`
`oauthAccount` + `forceLoginMethod`) takes precedence and gets sent to the
non-Anthropic endpoint, which rejects it. `--settings` overrides do **not** fix
it. The fix is a dedicated, empty config dir:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.fleet-worker/cfg"   # no inherited OAuth/hooks
```

The launcher sets this automatically. It also gives each worker a clean
hook/permission/MCP profile so it can't trip the host's hooks. Full analysis in
[references/fleet-worker-spec.md](references/fleet-worker-spec.md) §4.

## Giving a worker skills

The isolated config dir starts **clean** — the worker inherits none of the host's
skills, MCP servers, or hooks (that isolation is what keeps it off your
credentials). So *provision* what a worker should have: drop skill dirs into the
worker's own config (`$FLEET_WORKER_CONFIG_DIR/skills/<name>/`) or commit them to
the project's `.claude/skills/` in the worktree. The cheap brain then loads the
same on-demand, progressively-disclosed procedural knowledge your orchestrator has
— often the cheapest way to lift a weak model's output on a specialized task.

## Setup

1. **Install** — these scripts ship with the skill. After `scripts/install.sh`
   they live at `~/.claude/skills/fleet-worker/scripts/`. Either call them by that
   path, or symlink onto PATH for convenience:
   ```bash
   ln -s ~/.claude/skills/fleet-worker/scripts/fleet-worker ~/.local/bin/fleet-worker
   ln -s ~/.claude/skills/fleet-worker/scripts/fleet-collect.sh ~/.local/bin/fleet-collect.sh
   ```
2. **Provide the key** (the launcher never prints it; resolution order):
   - `export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<key>`, or
   - `export FLEET_WORKER_KEYRING_SERVICE=<svc> FLEET_WORKER_KEYRING_KEY=<name>` (uses `keyring get`), or
   - `export ZHIPU_API_KEY=<key>` (or `GLM_API_KEY`).
3. **Preflight** — `bash scripts/fleet-doctor.sh --offline` (structural) or
   `--live` (pings the endpoint; warns about the §4 oauth trap).

### Config knobs (env, all optional)

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `FLEET_WORKER_BASE_URL` | `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic` | Anthropic-compatible endpoint |
| `FLEET_WORKER_MODEL` | `GLM-5.3` | main model (opus+sonnet mapping); 5.3 reasoning levels are low/high/max via `FLEET_WORKER_EFFORT` (thinking cannot be disabled on 5.3) |
| `FLEET_WORKER_SMALL_MODEL` | `GLM-4.5-Air` | background/cheap model (haiku mapping) |
| `FLEET_WORKER_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.fleet-worker/cfg` | isolated config dir — **one per parallel worker** |
| `FLEET_WORKER_EFFORT` | `high` | seeded `effortLevel` in the worker's settings |
| `FLEET_WORKER_PERMISSION_MODE` | `bypassPermissions` | worker `--permission-mode`; use `dontAsk` + an allowlist to spawn from an auto-mode orchestrator (see *Permission posture*) |
| `FLEET_WORKER_CLAUDE_BIN` | `claude` | claude binary to exec; callers that preflight-validated an override (fleetflow's `FLEETFLOW_CLAUDE_BIN`) forward it here so the validated binary is the one that runs |

Point `FLEET_WORKER_BASE_URL`/`FLEET_WORKER_MODEL` at any other Anthropic-compatible
gateway (this is the documented Claude Code custom-endpoint mechanism) to drive a
different cheap model.

**Staying all-Anthropic?** The same separate-process trick runs a cheaper *Claude*
model as the worker — an Opus orchestrator with Sonnet/Haiku workers, no third-party
account. Point `FLEET_WORKER_BASE_URL` at Anthropic's API and set `FLEET_WORKER_MODEL`/
`FLEET_WORKER_SMALL_MODEL` to a Claude model, authenticating with an Anthropic API key.
The defaults target z.ai/GLM only because that's the cheapest brain; the mechanism
doesn't care which model answers.

## When to delegate (and when not)

| Delegate to a worker | Keep on the orchestrator |
|---|---|
| Independent, well-scoped, tool-using subtasks | Tasks needing this conversation's context |
| Refactors, test-writing, doc edits, mechanical multi-file changes | Judgment calls, architecture, ambiguous specs |
| Work where Opus-quality isn't required and a wrong edit is cheap to discard | Anything expensive-if-wrong and unreviewed |

The safety comes from the **cage, not the model**: isolated worktree (blast
radius), isolated config dir (no host creds/hooks), and the orchestrator's
merge gate (nothing lands without review).

## Model routing convention (hybrid: in-process tiers + provider workers)

"Delegate or not" has a third axis: **which model**, and **where**. One taxonomy
answers both — for the in-process Workflow-tool agents *and* the fleet-worker
provider workers — so a fan-out routes models intentionally instead of defaulting
every agent to the orchestrator's model.

It rests on the *architecture crux* above: model **alias slots** (`opus｜sonnet｜haiku`)
vary **per agent within one process** (set via a Workflow `agent()`'s `opts.model`),
but the **provider** (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) is **process-global** — so cross-provider
routing needs a separate process, which is fleet-worker. Hence two loci:

| Work class | Locus | Model | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **mechanical** | fleet-worker (GLM) or in-proc | `haiku` / GLM-4.5-Air | low |
| **scout** | in-proc (fleet-worker if wide) | `sonnet` / GLM-5.3 | low |
| **build** | in-proc | `sonnet`→`opus` | medium |
| **synthesize** | in-proc only | inherit (session = Fable/Opus) | high |
| **judge** | in-proc only | inherit (session = Fable/Opus) | high–max |

**Locus rule:** shell out to fleet-worker only for a **large (≈12+), independent,
file-mutating, cost-dominant** fan-out you can **gate before landing**; everything
else — and always synthesize/judge — stays in-process. Two guardrails: *never
under-power a judge* (a cheap rubber-stamp verifier is worse than none), and *reach
for the `effort` lever before the `model` lever* (it's finer-grained, no quality cliff).

Drop-in helper + worked examples (review→verify, hybrid migrate, budget-aware
degradation): [`assets/route.js`](assets/route.js) and
[`references/model-routing.md`](references/model-routing.md).

## Single-worker recipe

```bash
cd <target-worktree>
fleet-worker --output-format json "Refactor src/parser.py to use the visitor pattern" \
  > result.json
fleet-collect.sh result.json && echo "succeeded — review the diff"
```

`fleet-collect.sh` gates on `is_error` (the real success signal — `subtype` lies)
and prints the worker's final text. Exit `0` = success, `10` = worker failed.

## Fan-out recipe (parallel workers)

Each task gets its **own git worktree + branch** *and* its **own config dir** so
N workers never clobber each other. Spawn from the orchestrator's Bash tool with
`run_in_background: true`, then collect by output file.

```bash
delegate() {                     # $1 = task-id, $2 = prompt
  local id="$1" prompt="$2" wt=".fleet-work/$1"
  git worktree add -q -b "fleet/$id" "$wt" HEAD
  ( cd "$wt"
    FLEET_WORKER_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.fleet-worker/cfg-$id" \
      fleet-worker --output-format json "$prompt" > "../$id.result.json" 2> "../$id.err"
  )
}
delegate task-a "Add tests for the auth module"      &
delegate task-b "Update the README install section"  &
delegate task-c "Refactor utils.py duplications"     &
wait                                                  # barrier

for id in task-a task-b task-c; do
  if fleet-collect.sh ".fleet-work/$id.result.json" >/dev/null; then echo "fleet/$id OK"; fi
done
```

Keep concurrency modest (≤ 4–6) — the binding constraint is endpoint quota, not
local CPU. `.gitignore` the scratch dirs (`.fleet-work/`, `.fleet-worker/`).

## Hand off to fleet-ops (test-gated landing)

The winning branches are ordinary git branches — land them with the sibling skill
instead of merging by hand:

```bash
fleet track fleet/task-a fleet/task-b fleet/task-c   # register as lanes
fleet land  fleet/task-a                          # sequential, test-gated, you review each diff
```

## Permission posture

Headless `-p` can't answer a permission prompt — it would stall, so the worker runs
in a **non-interactive** mode. The default is `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`
(set `FLEET_WORKER_PERMISSION_MODE` to override); safety comes from the **cage**
(isolated worktree + isolated config + merge gate), not the prompt. Optionally
constrain further with `--disallowedTools` (e.g. block `WebFetch`) or `--add-dir`.

**Spawning from an auto-mode orchestrator.** If the session that runs `fleet-worker`
is itself in **auto mode**, a `bypassPermissions` launch is *hard-denied* by the
auto-mode classifier as **Create Unsafe Agents** (an agent spawning an ungated agent)
— and no allow-rule saves it (broad/interpreter allow-rules are dropped on entry to
auto mode). Two fixes, either works:

1. **Launch from outside the auto-mode session** — run the fan-out from a plain
   script / Task Scheduler / cron, or keep the orchestrator interactive
   (`default`/`acceptEdits`). With no parent classifier in the loop, the worker's own
   `bypassPermissions` is fine.
2. **Give the worker gates** — `FLEET_WORKER_PERMISSION_MODE=dontAsk` plus an allowlist
   (`--allowedTools "Read Edit Write Bash(npm:*) Bash(git:*)"`, or `permissions.allow`
   in the worker's config). `dontAsk` is **equally non-interactive** — it auto-denies
   non-allowlisted calls instead of stalling — but it is *not* an "unsafe agent," so an
   auto-mode orchestrator will spawn it. The launcher warns if you select `dontAsk`
   with no allowlist (the worker would otherwise auto-deny everything). Keep
   `bypassPermissions` for the isolated-container variant.

`FLEET_WORKER_PERMISSION_MODE` accepts any Claude Code mode
(`default|acceptEdits|plan|auto|dontAsk|bypassPermissions`). See
[../../docs/AUTO-MODE-CLASSIFIER.md](../../docs/AUTO-MODE-CLASSIFIER.md) for the full
classifier model (the override rules, the broad-allow-rule drop, and §7.9 on running
headless sessions).

> **Worktree-under-`.claude/` gotcha:** Claude Code's sensitive-file guard runs
> *before* `bypassPermissions` for anything under `.claude/`. Keep manual worker
> worktrees at the repo top (e.g. `.fleet-work/`), not under `.claude/`.

## Reliability & limits

- **Overload (429/529)** is the real-world risk, worst during the model's
  launch-window peak hours. Retry with jittered backoff, cap attempts, prefer
  off-peak, and consider routing overflow to `FLEET_WORKER_SMALL_MODEL`.
- **Bound the loop:** set `--max-turns N` and an orchestrator-side wall-clock
  timeout per worker. Collect via background + notification; never block.
- **Cost figures are notional:** `total_cost_usd` is Claude Code's internal
  pricing table applied to a model it doesn't know — ignore it; account by
  `usage.*_tokens` and your provider's plan.
- Re-dispatch is clean (the worktree makes retries idempotent).

## Security

Key pulled at spawn time into a process-local env var, never written to the
script, args (`ps`-safe), or logs. Isolated config dir keeps worker creds/session
separate from the host — and the worker can't read the host's subscription
credentials. Avoid `--debug` in shared logs (may print headers).

## Know your terms (read before publishing or automating)

Using Claude Code with a custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is a **documented** feature,
and a non-Anthropic worker's inference never touches Anthropic's API/subscription. But terms
change and vary by plan — verify both your **Anthropic** terms and your **model
provider's** terms for your own use. Two specifics worth knowing:

- **Automated subscription access:** Anthropic's Consumer Terms restrict driving a
  Claude.ai/Pro/Max **subscription** by "automated or non-human means … except
  when accessing via an Anthropic API Key." Keep the orchestrator **interactive**,
  or run it on an **API key** if you automate it. (A non-Anthropic worker isn't
  reached by this clause; an Anthropic-model worker driven by an **API key** lands
  in the API-key exemption.)
- This skill is a tool, not legal advice. When in doubt, ask your provider.

## Scripts

- `scripts/fleet-worker` / `scripts/fleet-worker.ps1` — the launcher (bash + PowerShell).
  `fleet-worker --help` for the full env/flag contract.
- `scripts/fleet-collect.sh` — gate a `--output-format json` result; exit 0 success /
  10 worker-failed; prints the final text. `fleet-collect.sh --help`.
- `scripts/fleet-doctor.sh` — `--offline` structural preflight + doc-consistency
  (CI-safe); `--live` pings the endpoint to confirm the model still resolves and
  flags the §4 oauth trap. `fleet-doctor.sh --help`.
