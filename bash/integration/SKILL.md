# Integration

Adapter for `codemap-py integrate` (`src/codemap_py/integration/__init__.py`). Claude Code or Codex may target Claude, Codex, or both; runs only native plugin-manager CLIs, never another runtime's model. `check` removed, no alias.

| Mode | Args | Mutation | Exit |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `audit` | `[--runtime {claude,codex,both}] [--json] [--since YYYY-MM-DD]` | none | 0 pass/warn; 1 fail; 2 bad syntax |
| `plan` | `[--runtime ...] [--consumers <csv>] [--source {local-candidate,release}] [--out <artifact>]` | report artifact only | 0; 2 bad syntax |
| `apply` | `--plan <artifact> --approve <sha256>` | verified source checkout only | 0; 1 drift/fs; 2 bad approve/syntax |
| `sync` | `--source {local-candidate,release} --plan <artifact> --approve <sha256> [--runtime ...]` | local runtime plugin state | 0; 1 partial-fail/journal; 2 bad approve |
| `demo` | `[--runtime ...]` | disposable evidence only | 0; 1 fail |

`--approve` requires `apply`/`sync`, a saved plan, and its displayed SHA-256. It never authorizes new targets, remote publication, Git mutation, marketplace/instruction edits, or deletion.

Closed set: Claude `foundry`, `oss`, `develop`, `research`; Codex `codex-rig`; provider `codemap-py`. Cross-check both marketplace and plugin manifests before mutation. `--runtime codex` selects only `codex-rig`, `claude` selects four Claude consumers, omitted/`both` selects all five. Explicit mapping, not discovery.

## Safety invariants

- `plan` records protocol/schema, operation ID, targets, before hashes, desired identity, argv, ordered operations, rollback identity, expected state, and SHA-256.
- Mutation revalidates target and before state immediately; drift invalidates approval. Source writes are atomic with before-images and reject foreign/modified markers, escapes, symlinks, installed caches, dirty overlap, and unverified identity.
- `sync` rejects unbuilt candidate sources, installed-byte/hash mismatch, and mutable/default-branch release or rollback identity; never assumes latest.
- On later-target failure, stop; rollback only approved operations. Claim completion/rollback only after post-state hashes verify.
- "Push" means local allowlisted source wiring plus native local runtime installation. Never `git push`, marketplace mutation, release publication, or direct installed-cache edit.

Active Codex consumer contract (requires `codex-rig` plugin) is its shipped `shared/codemap-contract.md`: its adapter validates `CODEMAP_BIN` first or PATH fallback once, runs provider-owned probe/query surface, persists one context artifact, lets specialists reuse it. Provider-managed `codemap-py-integration.md` block is metadata-only; identity/protocol/timestamp fields don't wire launcher or prove active guidance. Audit checks provider identity and reachable active consumer guidance separately, reports missing/unreachable/outdated guidance as bounded source maintenance (or an existing approved `plan_sync` target). Never borrow another plugin's shared script or edit installed caches. Distinguish installed-byte/hash evidence from current-session activation: native listing without session provenance is not proof, and matching source hashes alone don't prove semantic currency.

## Runtime note

Codex has no `bin/` PATH entry or plugin-root variable. Resolve installed root once, substitute `PLUGIN_ROOT`, retain in reasoning. Print plan summary and SHA-256 before User Questions control; preserve exact confirmation syntax, wait for valid answer bound to that digest before `apply`/`sync`.

When `--runtime` includes Codex (`codex`, `both`, or omitted), discover the active `codex-rig` via native CLI, never hand-edit config:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace list --json
codex plugin list --marketplace borda-ai-rig --json
```

If installed Codex lacks documented `--json`, use text output and mark structured comparison unavailable. After `sync` installs/reinstalls `codex-rig` or `codemap-py`, say: "Start a new Codex session before relying on the updated plugin — this session's tool list was resolved before the update."

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve mode

Case-insensitive: empty or starting with `audit` → audit; otherwise `plan`, `apply`, `sync`, or `demo`. Any other input: ask through User Questions which of those five modes and wait. Use the packaged native `ask_user` form when the synchronous menu cannot fit all five; offer every mode as a separate option and retain each mode's later input and approval requirements.

### 2. Run it

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/codemap-py integrate audit [--runtime <r>] [--json] [--since YYYY-MM-DD]
PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/codemap-py integrate plan [--runtime <r>] [--consumers <csv>] [--source <s>] [--out <artifact>]
PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/codemap-py integrate apply --plan <artifact> --approve <sha256>
PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/codemap-py integrate sync --source <s> --plan <artifact> --approve <sha256> [--runtime <r>]
PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/codemap-py integrate demo [--runtime <r>]
```

`audit`: bounded read-only provider/consumer/version/content/managed-block/index/log/usage inspection. Never runs `plan`, `apply`, `sync`, index, query self-heal, native mutation, or global-instruction installation. Checks provider identity and active consumer guidance reachability/content separately; report `consumer_query_guidance_missing`, `consumer_query_guidance_unreachable`, or `consumer_query_guidance_drift` as source maintenance, not active wiring. Same-version content mismatch is high-severity drift; native listing without provenance is `session_catalog: unobservable`. Codex has CLI/tool shards but no skill-start hook; host hooks provide no token usage — report evidence limits, not fresh-session activation or token savings. `--json` uses schema 2 (`codemap-py.integration.v2`); `--since` filters telemetry.

`plan`: write only; print artifact, targets, SHA-256. `apply`: require matching shown SHA-256 and explicit user approval. `sync`: same gate plus explicit source; give fresh-session instruction above if applicable. `demo`: audit plus one representative structural smoke query; evidence disposable unless mutation separately approved, and makes no token-savings or current-session activation claim.

### 3. Report

Explain `0` success, `1` runtime/filesystem failure or partial-sync journal, and `2` syntax/approval failure. On `sync` exit `1`, report state (`planned → approved → applying:<t> → verified:<t> → complete`, or `rollback-started → rollback-succeeded|rollback-failed → recovery-required`); for `recovery-required`, give only engine-reported bounded recovery commands.
