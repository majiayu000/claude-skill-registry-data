# Rootly  -  Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `rootly-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/rootly/install.sh)
   ```
2. Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Servosity/msp-skills/main/skills/rootly/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
3. Verify: `rootly-cli --version`
4. Ensure `~/.local/bin` (macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows) is on `$PATH`.

The installer downloads the `rootly-cli` and `rootly-mcp` binaries into `~/.local/bin`
(macOS / Linux) or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\msp-skills` (Windows). It does not
register the skill with your agent and writes no MCP client config - see
[mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for that wire-up.

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the runtime cannot see the binary directory on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

The official rootly-cli exposes a handful of resource groups; Rootly's API has ~98. This CLI types the entire surface, then adds what no Rootly tool has: a local SQLite mirror powering offline incident-similarity (related), solution-mining (fixed-last-time), MTTR/MTTA analytics (mttr), service scorecards (service-health), and cross-schedule coverage-gap detection (coverage-gaps)  -  the same agentic capabilities the AI-Labs MCP server reaches a remote service to compute, here for free in your terminal.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this CLI when you are operating Rootly from a terminal or an agent loop: declaring and updating incidents, checking who is on call across services, computing reliability analytics for a review, or gating a deploy on incident state. It is the right tool when you want offline, composable answers (pipe to jq, gate on exit codes) instead of clicking through the Rootly web UI, and especially when an MSP-style portfolio of many services makes per-service browsing impractical.

## Anti-triggers

Do not use this CLI for:
- Do not use this CLI to drive the Rootly web UI (Slack-channel creation, Zoom bridges, status-page theming)  -  those are UI/integration workflows the API does not expose as commands.
- Do not use the 17 analytics commands (related, mttr, oncall-now, ...) before a sync  -  they read the local SQLite mirror and return empty results on a cold store.
- Do not use 'digest' for an end-of-shift summary scoped to one schedule; use 'handoff' instead.
- Do not use 'escalation-trace' for the portfolio-wide who-is-on-call view; use 'oncall-now' instead.
- Do not use 'sla-breach' for historical mean-time trends; use 'mttr' instead.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Incident intelligence (offline)
- **`related`**  -  Find the past incidents most similar to a given one, ranked, so you can see how this class of problem played out before.

  _Reach for this during triage when a symptom feels familiar  -  it surfaces prior incidents and their resolutions without a remote ML round-trip._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli related INC-1234 --agent --limit 5
  ```
- **`war-room`**  -  One screen for an active incident: header, severity/status, full timeline, open action items, the on-call for the affected service, and the next escalation rung.

  _Use at the top of an incident to get full situational context in one command instead of five browser tabs._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli war-room INC-1234 --agent
  ```
- **`fixed-last-time`**  -  Mine the resolution notes and action items from a service's past incidents to surface what actually resolved this class of problem.

  _Pick this when an alert smells like a repeat  -  it answers 'what did we do last time' from history instead of guesswork._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli fixed-last-time <service-or-query> --agent --limit 10
  ```
- **`postmortem-skeleton`**  -  Emit a paste-ready post-mortem markdown skeleton for an incident: timeline, action items, severity, duration, and affected services.

  _Use at the start of a retrospective to skip the copy-paste assembly and go straight to analysis._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli postmortem-skeleton INC-1234
  ```
- **`action-items-overdue`**  -  List every open or overdue incident action item across all incidents, grouped by owner or team, with incident, severity, and age.

  _Reach for this in the weekly review to see which post-incident commitments are slipping and who owns them._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli action-items-overdue --group-by owner --agent
  ```
- **`digest`**  -  Time-windowed rollup of everything that moved since a timestamp: incidents opened/resolved, severity changes, new action items, alerts fired.

  _Reach for this after time away or before standup for a portfolio-wide what-moved rollup; use handoff for shift-scoped summaries._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli digest --since 24h --agent
  ```

### On-call operations
- **`coverage-gaps`**  -  Scan every on-call schedule for unstaffed windows over the next N days so you catch holiday and weekend gaps before a page is missed.

  _Run this on Monday (or in CI) to find on-call holes proactively rather than after someone misses an alert._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli coverage-gaps --days 14 --agent
  ```
- **`oncall-now`**  -  Show who is on call right now across every schedule and service in one table, escalation tier included.

  _Use when a page fires and you need to know who is responsible across all services without opening each schedule._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli oncall-now --agent
  ```
- **`handoff`**  -  End-of-shift summary: incidents opened, closed, and still open during the outgoing shift window, plus open action items and severity mix.

  _Run at shift change so the next on-call inherits an accurate picture instead of a retyped-from-memory note._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli handoff --schedule primary-oncall --agent
  ```
- **`oncall-load`**  -  Rank people by on-call hours and pages received across every schedule, so uneven rotations and burnout risk surface before someone quits.

  _Reach for this when asked who is overloaded, whether the rotation is fair, or who absorbed the most pages this month._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli oncall-load --days 30 --agent
  ```
- **`escalation-trace`**  -  Print the full ordered escalation ladder for a service or incident  -  every rung, the policy it comes from, who currently sits at each level, and the delay before the next page.

  _Reach for this during a page to answer 'who is next if nobody acks' without walking four API objects by hand._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli escalation-trace --service checkout-api --agent
  ```

### Reliability analytics
- **`mttr`**  -  Compute mean time to acknowledge and resolve from incident timestamps, grouped by service, team, or severity, with optional volume counts.

  _Use for the weekly reliability review or to quantify whether a service is trending worse over time._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli mttr --by service --since 30d --agent
  ```
- **`service-health`**  -  Per-service scorecard: incident count, MTTR, last incident, open action items, current on-call, and SLA status in one row.

  _Pull this before a deploy or during a portfolio review to judge a service's health at a glance._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli service-health <service> --agent
  ```
- **`sla-breach`**  -  List incidents that have breached or are about to breach their SLA target, sorted by time remaining, with a non-zero exit when any active breach exists.

  _Reach for this to gate dashboards or escalations on real SLA risk; exit code makes it pipeline-wireable._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli sla-breach --within 2h --agent
  ```

### CI / deploy plumbing
- **`deploy-guard`**  -  Pre-deploy gate for a service: checks for an open incident, confirms someone is on call, and flags recent flakiness, returning a non-zero exit code when it is unsafe to ship.

  _Wire into a deploy script so a risky push is blocked when the target service is mid-incident or has no on-call coverage._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli deploy-guard <service> --within 7d
  ```

### Config & signal hygiene
- **`config-diff`**  -  Diff the current synced Rootly config (services, escalation policies, workflows, severities, schedules) against the last saved snapshot to see what was added, removed, or changed  -  'config-diff --save' records the baseline.

  _Reach for this when auditing whether live Rootly config drifted from what config-as-code thinks it manages._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli config-diff --agent
  ```
- **`alert-noise`**  -  Rank alert sources and services by alert volume, repeat-fire rate, and how many alerts never became incidents  -  the signal-to-noise view that finds a flapping integration.

  _Reach for this when on-call is drowning: it names the noisiest source and the alerts that never become real incidents._

  ```bash
  rootly-cli alert-noise --days 14 --agent
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
rootly-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match  -  fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes

### Triage a familiar-looking incident

```bash
rootly-cli related INC-1234 --agent --limit 5
```

Surface the five most similar past incidents so you can reuse a known resolution path.

### Narrow a verbose incident list for an agent

```bash
rootly-cli incidents list --agent --select data.id,data.attributes.title,data.attributes.created_at,data.attributes.severity
```

JSON:API returns tens of KB per call; dotted --select returns only the fields an agent needs so it does not burn context parsing the rest.

### Find Monday's on-call holes

```bash
rootly-cli coverage-gaps --days 14 --agent
```

Report every unstaffed on-call window in the next two weeks across all schedules before a page is missed.

### Gate a deploy on service health

```bash
rootly-cli deploy-guard <service> --within 7d
```

Exit non-zero when checkout-api has an open incident, no on-call, or recent flakiness  -  drop it into a deploy script.

### Build the weekly reliability review

```bash
rootly-cli service-health --agent
```

Emit a per-service scorecard (incidents, MTTR, open action items, on-call, SLA) for the whole portfolio in one pass.

## Auth Setup

Set a Rootly API key as ROOTLY_API_KEY (the same variable the official rootly-cli uses; ROOTLY_API_TOKEN is also accepted). Keys come in Global, Team, and Personal scopes from your Rootly account settings; the CLI sends it as a Bearer token over JSON:API. No tenant or org id is needed  -  the key identifies the workspace. Run `rootly-cli doctor` to confirm the key is valid and the API is reachable.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable**  -  JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable**  -  `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  rootly-cli alert-events get <id> --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable**  -  `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly**  -  sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive**  -  never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Explicit retries**  -  use `--idempotent` only when an already-existing create should count as success, and `--ignore-missing` only when a missing delete target should count as success

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal AND no machine-format flag (`--json`, `--csv`, `--compact`, `--quiet`, `--plain`, `--select`) is set  -  piped/agent consumers and explicit-format runs get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
rootly-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
rootly-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
rootly-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.local/share/rootly-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `ROOTLY_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `ROOTLY_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
rootly-cli profile save briefing --json
rootly-cli --profile briefing alert-events get <id>
rootly-cli profile list --json
rootly-cli profile show briefing
rootly-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `rootly-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)

## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP binary (run the install script from the Prerequisites section, or see [mcp-install.md](./mcp-install.md) for per-agent wire-up).
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add rootly-mcp -- rootly-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which rootly-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   rootly-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `rootly-cli <command> --help`.
