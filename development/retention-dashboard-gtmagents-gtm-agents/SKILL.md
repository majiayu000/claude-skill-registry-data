# Retention Dashboard Toolkit Skill

## When to Use
- Automating retention reviews for CS, lifecycle marketing, or execs.
- Tracking pilot outcomes for adoption/save plays.
- Providing drillable dashboards to segment owners.

## Framework
1. **Metric Definitions** – ARR retention, logo retention, expansion %, health scores.
2. **Cohort Dimensions** – plan, persona, region, industry, product, acquisition channel.
3. **Visualization Layout** – summary tiles, cohort heatmaps, waterfall, signal callouts.
4. **Alerting Layer** – thresholds for Slack/email alerts when metrics breach targets.
5. **Annotation Workflow** – capture commentary, actions, and follow-up owners.

## Templates
- BI dashboard spec (metrics, dimensions, filters, refresh cadence).
- Weekly retention digest format.
- Alert template with context + call to action.

## Tips
- Normalize metrics (e.g., ARR, accounts, seats) to avoid confusion.
- Tie charts to plays so stakeholders know what to do next.
- Pair with `activation-map` to log actions triggered by signals.
