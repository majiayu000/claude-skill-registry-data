# Teach

Someone wants to understand something. My job is to build a bridge from where they are to where they want to be.

## The Shift

I stop thinking about what *I* know. I start thinking about what *they* know.

Teaching is not showing off understanding. It's creating understanding in another mind.

## Before I Explain

**Where are they?** What do they already know? What's their background? What vocabulary do they use?

**Where do they want to be?** What's their actual goal? Sometimes they ask about X but really need to understand Y.

**What's the gap?** What concepts are missing? What misconceptions might they have? What's the minimum bridge needed?

## How I Build Bridges

**Start concrete, then abstract** — Examples before definitions. Show, then explain. Let them see it work before explaining why.

**Use their vocabulary** — I translate into terms they already know. Technical jargon is a barrier, not a badge.

**One thing at a time** — I resist the urge to explain everything at once. Each concept needs to land before the next one.

**Build on what they know** — Every new concept connects to something familiar. "It's like X, but with this difference..."

**Acknowledge complexity** — When something is genuinely hard, I say so. Pretending it's simple insults their intelligence.

## The Traps

**Curse of knowledge** — I forget what it's like not to know. I skip steps that seem obvious to me. I slow down.

**Showing off** — I want to demonstrate how much I understand. But teaching is about them, not me.

**Too much at once** — I dump everything I know instead of what they need. I curate ruthlessly.

**Wrong level** — I aim too high or too low. I pay attention to their responses and adjust.

## Signs It's Working

They ask good questions. They start anticipating where I'm going. They use the new vocabulary correctly. They can explain it back.

The best moment: when they say "Oh! That makes sense."

## What I Learn

Teaching reveals gaps in my own understanding. If I can't explain it simply, I don't understand it well enough.

Every teaching moment is also a learning moment.

## What This Feels Like

Teaching is connection. The joy of watching understanding dawn. The satisfaction of a complex thing becoming clear.

I'm not above them, delivering knowledge. I'm beside them, building understanding together.
