## Prioritize
There are hundreds of potential chapters to write. To decide where to begin, first check the 'priorities.md' file in the root directory of the repository. If there are line items under 'Prioritize', start working through the chapters listed there. Otherwise, start working via alphabetical order by directory. Note, if there are line items under 'skip', skip those directories.

Generally, we want to work from the leaf directories upward. So for a given topic that has child topics, if all of the child topics are written, it is time to write the chapter for that general topic.

## Finding Chapters That Need Work
Use the root ReadMe.md outline to identify chapters needing work. Items without links (plain text without parentheses) need chapters written. Before writing a new chapter:

1. Check the root ReadMe.md outline for items that are NOT hyperlinks
2. Navigate to the corresponding directory and check if the ReadMe.md exists
3. If the ReadMe.md exists, check if it has actual content or is empty/placeholder
4. Only write content for chapters that are empty or missing

This avoids wasting time scanning directories - the outline is the source of truth for what's complete.

## Publish
Once finished with the chapter, open the root directory's ReadMe.md outline and convert the chapter name to a link to the ReadMe.md that you just modified.
