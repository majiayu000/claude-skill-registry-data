# Writing Rap Lyrics

Master rhythm and poetry to create professional-sounding rap with proper flow, structure, and timing.

## Quick Start

**Most common mistake**: Focusing only on rhymes without understanding rhythm.
**Solution**: Learn to be a musical instrument by mastering bars, beats, and cadences using table format.

**Basic bar structure** in 16-column table:

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Kick** | | | | **Snare** | | | | **Kick** | | | | **Snare** | | | |

- Columns 1, 5, 9, 13 = Beats 1, 2, 3, 4
- Kick drums on beats 1 and 3 (columns 1 and 9)
- Snare drums on beats 2 and 4 (columns 5 and 13)

## Core Concepts

### Bars and Beats

**Bar**: A set length of time used to measure rap distance. Like a mile or kilometer for music.
- Producers ask for "16-bar verses," not "1 minute of rapping"
- Every bar contains 4 beats in most rap music

**Tempo/BPM**: Speed at which bars move (Beats Per Minute)
- High BPM = faster movement through bars
- Low BPM = slower movement through bars

**Drum pattern reference**:
- Kick drum: Usually on beats 1 and 3
- Snare drum: Usually on beats 2 and 4

### The Three Rhythm Counts

**Quarter Notes (4 Count)**:
- One syllable per beat
- Practice: "1, 2, 3, 4"
- Foundation of rhythm

**Eighth Notes (8 Count)**:
- Two syllables per beat (beat divided in half)
- Practice: "1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and"
- The "and" is the half-beat

**Sixteenth Notes (16 Count)**:
- Four syllables per beat (most common in rap)
- Practice: "One-you-better, Two-you-better, Three-you-better, Four-you-better"
- Each word is one sixteenth note

See [rhythm-reference.md](reference/rhythm-reference.md) for advanced note patterns and timing.

## Lyric Formatting Rules

**Critical**: Always format lyrics in table format for precise timing and visual rhythm patterns.

### Table Format System

**16-Column Table** (Standard):
- Each column = one sixteenth note
- One bar = 16 columns (4 beats × 4 sixteenth notes per beat)
- Use for: Most rap songs, standard timing

**32-Column Table** (Double-time):
- Each column = one thirty-second note
- One bar = 32 columns
- Use for: Very fast rap, technical flows, detailed timing

### Basic 16-Column Structure

Each bar is one row. Columns represent sixteenth note positions:

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Beat markers**:
- Columns 1, 5, 9, 13 = On-beat (downbeats)
- Columns 3, 7, 11, 15 = Eighth note positions (&)
- Columns 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 = Off-beat sixteenth notes

### Why Table Format?

1. **Visual rhythm**: See exactly where syllables land
2. **Rhyme patterns**: Rhymes in same columns are obvious
3. **Beat alignment**: Ensure words hit on correct beats
4. **Producer friendly**: Easier to develop beats around lyrics
5. **Pattern recognition**: Repeating flows become clear

### Formatting Rules

- **One syllable per cell** (or merge cells for held notes)
- **Empty cells = silence/rest**
- **Bold text = emphasis/loud delivery**
- *Italics = soft/whisper delivery*
- Use `|` for breath marks
- Group rows in sets of 4 bars for readability

## Creating Flow with Cadences

**Cadence**: A pattern of notes and pauses (like "dance moves" for rappers)

### Using the Scatting Technique

1. **Make random sounds** over the beat instead of words
2. **Focus purely on rhythm** without worrying about meaning
3. **Find a rhythm you like** through experimentation
4. **Fit your lyrics** into that rhythm pattern
5. **Adjust words** to match the cadence perfectly

**Why scatting works**: You become a musical instrument, discovering flows naturally.

## Making Your Rap Catchy

Human ears love **patterns**. Create catchiness through three layers:

### 1. Cadence Patterns
- Repeat rhythm patterns across 2-4 bars
- Don't make every bar exactly the same
- Keep parts of the rhythm similar

### 2. Rhyme Scheme Patterns
- **Internal rhymes**: Rhymes inside a bar
- **End rhymes**: Rhymes at end of bar
- Place rhymes in same spot for at least 2 bars

### 3. Delivery Patterns
- **Emotion and tone** variations
- Example: Relaxed tone with louder emphasis on rhyming words
- Creates "3D effect" that makes rhymes "pop"

## Best Practices

**Even Numbers Rule**: Keep patterns for 2, 4, or 8 bars
- Odd numbers feel unfinished to listeners

**Start Simple**: Master 8-count and 16-count before complex flows

**Practice Daily**: Work on counts and patterns consistently

**Don't Rush**: Build from quarter notes → eighth notes → sixteenth notes

## Workflow for Writing a Verse

1. **Choose your beat** and identify the tempo
2. **Decide format**: 16-column (standard) or 32-column (double-time/technical)
3. **Count along**: Practice "1, 2, 3, 4" to find the kicks and snares
4. **Scat over the beat** to discover natural rhythms
5. **Lock in a cadence** pattern you like (2-4 bars)
6. **Create table**: Set up 16 or 32 columns with header row
7. **Fill in syllables**: Place each syllable in correct column
8. **Mark emphasis**: Use bold for loud delivery, italics for soft
9. **Check patterns**: Ensure rhymes and rhythms repeat in same columns
10. **Practice delivery**: Rap along with the table to verify timing

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: "My lyrics sound off when I rap them"
**Solution**: You're only focusing on rhymes. Learn the rhythm counts first and use table format.

**Issue**: "I can't remember my timing"
**Solution**: Use table format. Seeing syllables in columns makes timing visual and memorable.

**Issue**: "My flow sounds random and messy"
**Solution**: Create patterns. In table format, repeat syllable placement in same columns across 2-4 bars.

**Issue**: "I don't know where to place my words"
**Solution**: Practice the three counts (4, 8, 16) and fill in the table columns systematically.

**Issue**: "The table format looks overwhelming"
**Solution**: Start with 16-column format and only fill eighth note positions (columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15). Progress to all 16 columns as you improve.

## Examples

**Example 1: Basic 8-Count Flow (16-Column Table)**
```
Input: "Write a simple 4-bar verse with basic flow"
Output:
```

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ev | | ery | | beat | | I'm | | count | | ing | | one | to | four | |
| Learn | | ing | | how | to | rap | | and | | so | much | **more** | | | |
| Sim | | ple | | eight | | count | | flow | is | where | I | **start** | | | |
| Mas | | ter | | ing | the | fun | da | men | tal | **art** | | | | | |

**Analysis**:
- Eighth note rhythm (every other column used)
- Rhymes "more/start/art" align in columns 13-14
- Emphasis on rhyming words (bold)

**Example 2: Dense 16-Count Flow with Internal Rhymes**
```
Input: "Write 2 bars with fast 16-count flow and internal rhymes"
Output:
```

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I'm | **hit** | ting | ev | ery | six | teenth | note | with | pre | ci | sion | ex | **act** | | |
| Rhy | thm | and | the | **rhymes** | in | ter | **twined** | and | that's | a | **fact** | | | | |

**Analysis**:
- Full 16-count pattern (most columns filled)
- Internal rhymes: "hit/six" (columns 2-6), "rhymes/twined" (columns 5-8)
- End rhymes: "exact/fact" (column 13)
- Pattern repeats across both bars

**Example 3: 32-Column Table for Technical Flow**
```
Input: "Show a very fast technical verse in 32-column format"
Output:
```

| 1|e|&|a|2|e|&|a|3|e|&|a|4|e|&|a|1|e|&|a|2|e|&|a|3|e|&|a|4|e|&|a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|can|rap|at|dou|ble|speed|with|tech|ni|cal|flow|that's|pre|cise|and|ev|ery|syl|la|ble|lands|ex|act|ly|where|I|de|signed|it|to|go|

**Analysis**:
- 32 columns for very fast delivery
- Almost every position filled
- Use for showing extremely technical, rapid-fire flows

**Example 4: Visualizing Rhythm Patterns**
```
Input: "Show how to see repeating patterns in table format"
Output:
```

| 1 | e | & | a | 2 | e | & | a | 3 | e | & | a | 4 | e | & | a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mon** | ey | in | my | **pock** | et | yeah | I | **got** | it | go | ing | **fast** | | | |
| **Run** | ning | to | the | **top** | and | I | ain't | **stop** | ping | for | no | **cast** | | | |

**Analysis**:
- Identical rhythm pattern in both bars
- Syllables land in exact same columns
- Rhyme scheme visible: "pocket/top" (column 5), "got/stop" (column 9), "fast/cast" (column 13)
- Shows how patterns create catchiness

## Remember

Rap = **Rhythm + Poetry**

You must master both. Most beginners focus only on poetry (rhymes and stories). The musical side (bars, beats, cadences) is what makes good lyrics sound professional.
