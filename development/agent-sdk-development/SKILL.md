# Agent SDK Meta Skill

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Invoke docs-management First

> **STOP - Before providing ANY response about Claude Agent SDK:**
>
> 1. **INVOKE** `docs-management` skill
> 2. **QUERY** using keywords: Agent SDK, TypeScript SDK, Python SDK, sessions, custom tools, permissions, or related topics
> 3. **BASE** all responses EXCLUSIVELY on official documentation loaded
>
> **Skipping this step results in outdated or incorrect information.**

### Verification Checkpoint

Before responding, verify:

- [ ] Did I invoke docs-management skill?
- [ ] Did official documentation load?
- [ ] Is my response based EXCLUSIVELY on official docs?

If ANY checkbox is unchecked, STOP and invoke docs-management first.

## Overview

Central authority for Claude Agent SDK (TypeScript and Python SDKs). This skill uses **100% delegation to docs-management** - it contains NO duplicated official documentation.

**Architecture:** Pure delegation with keyword registry. All official documentation is accessed via docs-management skill queries.

## Reference Loading Guide

This skill follows a **pure delegation architecture** with three loading layers:

### Layer 1: Always in Context

- **SKILL.md** (this file) - Keyword registry, decision trees, delegation patterns

### Layer 2: On-Demand via docs-management

All official Agent SDK documentation is accessed through docs-management queries:

| doc_id | Topic |
| --- | --- |
| platform-claude-com-docs-en-agent-sdk-overview | SDK overview and getting started |
| platform-claude-com-docs-en-agent-sdk-typescript | TypeScript SDK API reference |

| platform-claude-com-docs-en-agent-sdk-skills | Skills integration |
| platform-claude-com-docs-en-agent-sdk-slash-commands | Slash command usage |

### Layer 3: External Resources (GitHub)

- TypeScript SDK: anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript
- Python SDK: anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python

1. Invoke docs-management skill with multiple queries:
   - "session management SDK", "session resumption"
   - "custom tools SDK", "creating custom tools"
   - "cost tracking SDK", "token usage"
2. Synthesize guidance from official documentation
```

### Troubleshooting Pattern

1. Invoke docs-management skill
2. Use keywords: "session management SDK", "resume option", "session ID"
3. Check official docs for session patterns
4. Guide user through proper session handling
```
