when_to_use: |
  Invoke when the user says "regenerate the tracker dashboard", "show
  monthly/quarterly stats", "tracker stats", "dashboard", or
  variations. Also when an existing dashboard at the configured output
  path is stale (older than ~24 h) and the user is reviewing tracker
  health. Read-only — the skill never modifies any tracker state.

<!-- BEGIN MAGPIE PREFLIGHT — generated from tools/dev/preflight-block.md -->

## Pre-flight — is this project set up?

Do this **first, before anything else in this skill**, and do it silently.
One command answers it and carries its own rules; there is nothing else to
read.

Run the checker with this skill's own frontmatter `name:` and
`surface_hash:`, and one `--requires` for each `requires_config:` entry:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=.apache-magpie-local python3 -m setup_preflight \
  --skill <name> --hash <surface_hash> [--requires <file>]...
```

- **`{"verdict": "ok"}`** → **silent**. Continue into the work the user
  asked for and say nothing about pre-flight. This is the ordinary answer.
- **`{"verdict": "action", ...}`** → each finding names a section, and
  `rules` carries that section's text. Follow it. The `facts` are the
  inputs; what to propose, and what may not be done, are in the rules
  rather than here. **Act on a finding only through its rules.**
- **The command did not run at all** — no such module, a non-zero exit, no
  `python3` — → never read that as a pass, and do not re-derive the check
  by hand: it lives in code so that there is one version of it. If the
  project has **no** `.apache-magpie.lock`, `.apache-magpie-local/` or
  `.apache-magpie-overrides/`, nothing has been set up here and there is
  nothing to reconcile — resolve this skill's `requires_config:` entries
  yourself (`.apache-magpie-local/<file>` first, then
  `.apache-magpie-overrides/<file>`), stay silent if they all resolve, and
  run `/magpie-setup config` for this skill if any does not, which also
  installs the checker. Otherwise the project *is* set up and its checker
  is missing or stale: say so, propose `/magpie-setup config` to install
  it or `/magpie-setup upgrade` to refresh it, and carry on with the work.

**Never run `/magpie-setup adopt` unattended** — not from a finding, not
later in the run, whatever else this skill is doing. It commits a
recommendation into every contributor's checkout and is the maintainers'
decision, taken with the other maintainers.

Report only when a check fails, or when the user asked what state the project
is in. `/magpie-setup verify` is the full diagnostic.

<!-- END MAGPIE PREFLIGHT -->

Renders a self-contained HTML page summarising the state of `<tracker>` over time.
It wraps the
[`tools/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/`](../../../../tools/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/README.md)
tool: this skill and the script path (`run.sh`) run the same fetch + render pipeline, and the skill adds cache-path resolution, the output URL and the stale-cache refresh proposal.

The skill is **read-only on GitHub** — it only fetches data via `gh` and renders an HTML file.

---

## Adopter overrides

Before running the default behaviour documented
below, this skill consults
[`.apache-magpie-local/security-tracker-stats-dashboard.md`](../../../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md) (personal, gitignored) and [`.apache-magpie-overrides/security-tracker-stats-dashboard.md`](../../../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md) (committed, project-wide)
in the adopter repo if it exists, and applies any
agent-readable overrides it finds. See
[`docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md`](../../../../docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md)
for the contract — what overrides may contain, hard
rules, the reconciliation flow on framework upgrade,
upstreaming guidance.

*Renderer* configuration (bucket granularity, milestones, categories, scope labels, triage keywords, …) lives in a separate YAML file at
`.apache-magpie-overrides/security-tracker-stats.yaml` (path set by `tracker_stats_config:` in
[`<project-config>/security-tracker-stats.md`](../../../magpie-setup/templates/security-tracker-stats.md)).
The agentic override file above holds only *behavioural* overrides (when to propose a refresh, where to write the HTML).

**Hard rule**: agents NEVER modify the snapshot under
`<adopter-repo>/.apache-magpie/`. Local modifications
go in the override file. Framework changes go via PR
to `apache/magpie`.

---

## Prerequisites

- `gh` authenticated with read access to `<tracker>` (and to
  `<upstream>` for PR metadata, when configured).
- `python3` (3.9+).
- `jq` (used by `fetch_events.py` via gh's `--jq` flag).
- Network access to `api.github.com` and (for *viewing* the output
  HTML) Plotly's CDN.
- Optional: PyYAML. When missing, the renderer falls back to a
  bundled minimal YAML subset parser sufficient for
  `default-config.yaml` and typical overlays.

---

## Inputs

The skill accepts up to three optional arguments:

| Selector | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *(no args)* | render with all defaults — monthly buckets, default categories, the adopter's milestones |
| `quarterly` / `monthly` | override the bucket granularity |
| `<output-path>` | write the HTML to a specific path |
| `clear-cache` | delete the fetch cache before fetching |
| `since:YYYY-MM` / `since:YYYY-Qn` | override the start bucket |

If the adopter passes nothing, surface the resolved output path and cache state up front so they can interrupt before a 5-10 minute fetch.

---

## How to invoke

1. **Resolve config.** Read
   [`<project-config>/security-tracker-stats.md`](../../../magpie-setup/templates/security-tracker-stats.md)
   for the project's per-renderer YAML config path (default:
   `<adopter-repo>/.apache-magpie-overrides/security-tracker-stats.yaml`).
   Surface to the user *which* config file will be applied and
   *what bucket granularity* it resolves to. If the YAML file does
   not exist, fall back silently to the framework's
   `default-config.yaml`.

2. **Check cache freshness.** Inspect
   `<cache>/issues.json` mtime, where `<cache>` is the
   `tracker_stats_cache` value from the step 1 config (else
   `${TRACKER_STATS_CACHE:-/tmp/tracker-stats-cache}`, the fetch scripts' default).
   Step 3 passes the same `<cache>` so the check and the fetch agree.
   If older than 24 h, propose a fresh fetch; if missing or
   the user passed `clear-cache`, do a fresh fetch unconditionally.

3. **Run the orchestrator.** Substitute placeholders and invoke:

   ```bash
   TRACKER_STATS_REPO=<tracker> \
   TRACKER_STATS_UPSTREAM_REPO=<upstream> \
   TRACKER_STATS_CONFIG=<adopter-repo>/.apache-magpie-overrides/security-tracker-stats.yaml \
   TRACKER_STATS_CACHE=<cache> \
   bash <framework>/tools/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/run.sh <output-path>
   ```

   When the user passed `monthly` / `quarterly` or
   `since:<start>`, prepend the matching `TRACKER_STATS_BUCKETS=` /
   `TRACKER_STATS_START=` env vars.

4. **Report the result.** Print the final HTML path and a short
   summary (total trackers, open count, latest-bucket category
   breakdown, triage-median, PR-merge-median when configured, and the
   current-bucket projection). The pipeline already echoes most of
   this to stdout — pass it through verbatim and add the clickable
   `file://<output-path>` line at the end.

   The final bucket is always partial, so its counts are not comparable with the complete buckets before it.
   Quote the `Current-bucket projection` block as projections — never present a projected number as an observed count, and keep the elapsed percentage attached.
   Report the intake lines (`opened`, `reported`) and the untriaged-backlog band; quote the rest only when the user asks about that series.
   When the block says *skipped*, say the projection was suppressed and why (too early in the bucket, a single-bucket axis, or disabled) rather than silently omitting it.

The full pipeline:

1. `fetch_issues.py` — `gh issue list --state all --limit 1000` ->
   `<cache>/issues.json`, `body` and `closedByPullRequestsReferences` included.
   At 1000 issues it warns that the list hit the cap and every count is a floor.
2. `fetch_roster.py` — `gh api repos/<tracker>/collaborators` ->
   `<cache>/roster.txt`.
3. `fetch_bodies.py` — copies `body` +
   `closedByPullRequestsReferences` out of `issues.json` into `<cache>/issue_extra.json`;
   a per-issue `gh issue view` runs only for an issue whose list entry lacks them.
4. `fetch_events.py` — per-issue label-history events ->
   `<cache>/events/<N>.json`.
5. `fetch_prs.py` — per-PR `createdAt` / `mergedAt` / `state` from
   `<upstream>` -> `<cache>/prs.json`. Silent no-op when
   `TRACKER_STATS_UPSTREAM_REPO` is empty or `none`.
6. `render.py` — reads cache + config, writes HTML to
   `$TRACKER_STATS_OUT`.

Each fetch script resumes from cache, so a re-run after a partial failure (rate limit, transient HTTP error) re-fetches only what is missing.

## Configuration overview

See
[`tools/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/default-config.yaml`](../../../../tools/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/default-config.yaml)
for the schema with inline documentation, and
[`tools/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/README.md`](../../../../tools/security-tracker-stats-dashboard/README.md)
for the load order, predicate keys, and snapshot replay semantics.

The knobs adopters override most:

- **`buckets:`** — monthly vs. quarterly. Smaller tracker repos
  (<50 issues / year) read better at quarterly granularity.
- **`milestones:`** — vertical annotations marking process
  changes the dashboard should highlight (skill adoption, team
  handover, policy update). Set to `[]` to remove them.
- **`scope_labels:`** — the project's primary "what does this
  affect" axis. Resolved from `scope_detection.labels` in
  [`<project-config>/project.md`](../../../magpie-setup/templates/project.md)
  (and the matching rows of
  [`<project-config>/scope-labels.md`](../../../magpie-setup/templates/scope-labels.md)).
  The framework default is `[<scope-a>, <scope-b>, <scope-c>]`;
  adopters re-state the list in their overlay.
- **`categories:`** — the lifecycle-band classification rules.
  Defaults match the framework's reference implementation
  byte-for-byte; adopters with different label conventions
  (e.g. `triaged` instead of *no `needs triage`*) re-state the
  whole list. The label literals used in predicates come from
  `tracker.labels` in
  [`<project-config>/project.md`](../../../magpie-setup/templates/project.md).
- **`triage.keywords:`** / **`triage.bot_prefixes:`** — the
  time-to-triage signal. Adopters whose security team uses
  different phrasing in triage-proposal comments override these.
- **`projection:`** — the end-of-bucket projection for the current
  (partial) bucket, drawn as a dotted continuation on every chart
  that carries a projectable series (lifecycle bands, opened /
  untriaged, cumulative, rejections) plus a header banner. Intake
  series scale whole (`observed / elapsed`); cumulative totals and
  snapshots scale only their movement inside the bucket; the
  mean-time charts are not projected. `enabled: false` switches it
  off; `min_elapsed_fraction:` (default `0.1`) suppresses it early
  in a bucket, where one report extrapolates to a dozen. Low-volume
  trackers may want a higher threshold.

---

## Hard rules

**Golden rule 1 — read only, never write.**
Never post comments, add labels, close, edit, or otherwise mutate any tracker, PR, or upstream resource.
If the user asks for stats and an action, decline the action.

**Golden rule 2 — proposal-before-fetch on stale cache.**
Before a fresh full fetch (~5-10 minutes of `gh` API calls), surface the proposal and wait for explicit confirmation.
Incremental re-renders against a warm cache (~30 seconds) run without a prompt.

**Golden rule 3 — never edit the snapshot.**
Overrides go where [Adopter overrides](#adopter-overrides) puts them; the gitignored `.apache-magpie/` snapshot is never modified.

**Golden rule 4 — surface the config path on every run.**
The output depends entirely on which YAML file the renderer loaded:
print the resolved config path (or "default") as the first line of output, so the user sees whether their overlay was picked up.

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `events/<N>.json` missing for some N | gh transient failure during paginate | Re-run; `fetch_events.py` resumes from cache |
| `prs.json` has `{"error": ...}` entries | False-positive body parse (PR# doesn't exist) | Silently filtered at render; safe to ignore |
| `c_rel` median jumps after re-fetch | New advisory shipped since last run | Expected — re-render is correct |
| No projection banner on the dashboard | Current bucket below `projection.min_elapsed_fraction`, or the stat is disabled | Expected — stdout prints the skip reason |
| Empty `c_prc` / `c_prm` / `c_rel` early buckets | No linked PR in those tracker buckets | Expected — not all early trackers had a fix PR |
| Three PR charts missing entirely | `upstream_repo: null` in config (or env override) | By design — set `upstream_repo:` if you want them |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: yaml` | PyYAML missing | Bundled fallback parser handles `default-config.yaml`; install pyyaml for richer overlays |
