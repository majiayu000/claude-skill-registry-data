# Executive Presence Skill

Building executive presence through intentional personal brand development based on Gartner research methodology.

## Overview

Executive presence is not innate charisma or personality. It is the deliberate alignment of your image, impressions, and impact to create influence. This skill provides a research-backed framework for discovering your current brand, evaluating your market position, establishing your zone of distinction, and distilling an aspirational brand promise that drives executive presence.

Most leaders overestimate their self-awareness: 90% believe they have executive presence, but only 15% actually demonstrate self-awareness about how others perceive them. This skill helps bridge that gap through structured discovery, evaluation, and intentional brand development.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when working on:

- Building or enhancing executive presence
- Creating an intentional personal brand
- Preparing for executive role transitions
- Career development and promotion readiness
- Leadership presence coaching or development
- Stakeholder influence strategies
- Overcoming limiting stereotypes (e.g., "order taker," "generic technologist")
- Recalibrating brand perception after role changes
- Strategic leadership positioning
- Executive communication planning
- Building influence without positional authority

**Keywords:** executive presence, personal brand, leadership brand, influence strategy, career development, executive positioning, zone of distinction, brand promise, leadership presence, stakeholder influence, brand recalibration

## Core Principles

### The Executive Presence Wheel of Influence

Executive presence operates through three interconnected phases:

#### 1. IMAGE - What People Know and Think

Your status and reputation precede you. Image is formed by:

- Your title and organizational position
- Your track record and accomplishments
- What others say about you when you're not present
- Your documented expertise and credentials
- Your professional history and associations

**Key Insight:** Image is your foundation, but it's passive. You need active cultivation through impressions and impact.

#### 2. IMPRESSIONS - What People Feel

Your appearances and communications shape emotional responses. Impressions come from:

- How you show up in meetings and presentations
- Your verbal and nonverbal communication style
- Your digital presence and written communications
- Your appearance, demeanor, and energy
- Your responsiveness and accessibility

**Key Insight:** Impressions bridge knowing (image) and doing (impact). They create the emotional foundation for influence.

#### 3. IMPACT - What People Do

Your experiences with others drive their actions. Impact manifests as:

- Whether people implement your recommendations
- Whether you receive resources and support
- Whether you're included in strategic conversations
- Whether others advocate for you
- Whether your influence extends beyond your role

**Key Insight:** Impact is the ultimate measure of executive presence. Without it, image and impressions are hollow.

### Fundamental Truths About Executive Presence

**Your presence shapes your influence.**
Executive presence is not about being charismatic or extroverted. It's about intentionally shaping how others perceive and respond to you.

**When your brand is unintentional, so is your presence.**
Without deliberate brand development, you inherit default perceptions based on your role, predecessors, or stereotypes.

**Brand distinction precedes brand esteem.**
Being memorable and differentiated is more valuable than being generically excellent. "Dependable technologist" is forgettable. "Digital transformation catalyst" is distinctive.

**Most leaders need recalibration, not reinvention.**
You don't need to become someone else. You need to understand how you're currently perceived and intentionally adjust what you amplify and what you minimize.

**Self-awareness is rare.**
95% of people believe they are self-aware, but only 15% actually are. The gap between self-perception and others' perception is where your work begins.

### The Three Identities (Erving Goffman)

Understanding which version of yourself you bring to work is critical:

1. **Onstage Identity** - The polished, professional version you present publicly
2. **Backstage Identity** - The more authentic version you show to trusted colleagues
3. **Offstage Identity** - Your private, unguarded self outside work

**Critical Question:** Which identity dominates your workplace presence? Are you so polished that you seem inauthentic? So unguarded that you lack gravitas? Finding the right balance is essential.

## Part 1: Discover Your Current Brand

### The Self-Awareness Gap

Before you can build an intentional brand, you must understand your current brand - how others actually perceive you today. This requires structured observation and inquiry.

### Step 1A: Practice Self-Observation Through Others

Create a **Brand Observation Journal** (template in resources/) and track:

**What words do people use to describe you?**

- In meetings: "Let's ask [name], they're always [adjective]"
- In introductions: "This is [name], our [description]"
- In emails: Pay attention to how people position you

**Why do people seek your help?**

- What problems do they bring to you?
- What expertise do they assume you have?
- What situations prompt them to include you?

**Which meetings are you invited to?**

- Strategic vs. tactical meetings
- Decision-making vs. informational meetings
- Cross-functional vs. departmental meetings
- Which meetings are you NOT invited to that you expected?

**What feedback patterns emerge?**

- Compliments you receive repeatedly
- Concerns raised across multiple reviews
- Themes in 360-degree feedback
- What people thank you for

### Step 1B: Hold Brand Discovery Conversations

**Preparation:**

1. **Select 5-8 diverse perspectives:**
   - Direct reports (how you lead)
   - Peers (how you collaborate)
   - Senior stakeholders (how you influence up)
   - Cross-functional partners (how you work horizontally)
   - Former colleagues (how you're remembered)

2. **Review existing feedback sources:**
   - Performance reviews (especially 360-degree feedback)
   - Psychometric assessments (MBTI, DiSC, StrengthsFinder, etc.)
   - Promotion and project feedback
   - Informal feedback from friends and family

3. **Set up conversations properly:**
   - Request 30-45 minutes
   - Choose neutral locations (not your office)
   - Explain you're working on professional development
   - Emphasize you want honest advice, not politeness
   - Promise not to defend or pushback

**Critical Ground Rules for Conversations:**

- **No pushback or defending** - Your job is to listen and understand, not justify
- **Put away all devices** - Show complete nonverbal attentiveness
- **Ask for advice, not feedback** - Advice is more critical and actionable
- **Listen for essence of truth** - Focus on themes, not isolated details
- **Request examples** - "Can you give me an example of when you saw that?"

**The Four-Quadrant Question Framework:**

Ask about your brand across four leadership dimensions. Use the template in `resources/templates/brand-discovery-questions.md`.

#### Quadrant 1: Strategic Thinking

*"How do you perceive my approach to strategic thinking and long-term planning?"*

Follow-up probes:

- Do I connect tactical work to strategic objectives effectively?
- How do I handle ambiguity and complexity?
- Do you see me as forward-thinking or reactive?
- What's an example of when my strategic thinking helped or hindered progress?

#### Quadrant 2: Decisiveness and Execution

*"What's your view of how I make decisions and drive execution?"*

Follow-up probes:

- Do I make decisions with appropriate speed and confidence?
- How do I balance data-driven analysis with timely action?
- Do you see me as someone who gets things done?
- What's an example of a decision I made well or poorly?

#### Quadrant 3: Communication and Influence

*"How would you describe my communication style and ability to influence?"*

Follow-up probes:

- How effective am I in meetings and presentations?
- Do I adjust my communication for different audiences?
- Do you find me persuasive? Why or why not?
- What's an example of when my communication was particularly effective or ineffective?

#### Quadrant 4: Relationship Building and Collaboration

*"How do you experience working with me and building relationships?"*

Follow-up probes:

- Do I build trust effectively?
- How approachable am I?
- How do I handle conflict or disagreement?
- What's an example of when I built or damaged a working relationship?

**The Bright Spots and Blind Spots Close:**

End every conversation with:

- "What are my bright spots - things I should amplify or leverage more?"
- "What are my blind spots - things I might not be aware of that hold me back?"

### Step 1C: Document and Synthesize

After each conversation, immediately document:

1. **Direct quotes** - Specific words and phrases used
2. **Themes** - Patterns across multiple conversations
3. **Surprises** - Perceptions that don't match your self-view
4. **Examples** - Concrete situations that illustrate points
5. **Emotional reactions** - Where you felt defensive or validated

Use the synthesis worksheet: `resources/worksheets/brand-discovery-synthesis.md`

## Part 2: Evaluate Your Results

### Recognize Your Values and Identity

Your brand must align with your authentic values, or it will be unsustainable and inauthentic.

**Exercise: Values Clarification**

Review your psychometric assessments and personal activities:

- What energizes you? What drains you?
- What do you do in your personal time?
- What issues or causes matter to you?
- What would you do if money wasn't a factor?
- What do you want to be known for when you retire?

Extract 5-8 core values that are non-negotiable for you.

### Watch for Weaknesses Masquerading as Strengths

Sometimes what you think is a strength is perceived as a liability:

- **"Detail-oriented"** might be perceived as **"micromanaging"** or **"unable to delegate"**
- **"Consensus-building"** might be perceived as **"indecisive"** or **"conflict-avoidant"**
- **"Passionate"** might be perceived as **"emotional"** or **"defensive"**
- **"Strategic"** might be perceived as **"disconnected from execution"** or **"impractical"**
- **"Direct"** might be perceived as **"abrasive"** or **"lacking empathy"**

**Exercise: Strength-Weakness Audit**

For each strength you identified in your self-observation:

1. How might others perceive this negatively?
2. Have you received feedback that suggests this perception?
3. Under what conditions does this strength become a liability?

### Distill Your Current Brand

Synthesize all discovery inputs into **2-3 words or phrases** that encapsulate how others currently see you.

**Examples of Current Brand Distillations:**

- "Reliable executor, risk-averse, operationally focused"
- "Technical expert, detail-oriented, limited business acumen"
- "Visionary strategist, disconnected from execution, inconsistent follow-through"
- "Collaborative relationship-builder, conflict-avoidant, slow decision-maker"
- "Data-driven analyst, thorough, struggles with ambiguity"

**Your current brand is not good or bad - it's your starting point.**

Document this in: `resources/worksheets/current-brand-statement.md`

## Part 3: Establish Your Zone of Distinction

Your zone of distinction is the intersection of three critical elements. This is where your aspirational brand lives.

### The Three Elements Framework

#### Element 1: Market Need - What Matters to Your Market

Your "market" is your enterprise context: CEO, Board, organizational strategy, industry pressures.

**Discovery Questions:**

- What are the CEO's top 3-5 priorities this year? (annual communications, board presentations)
- What challenges keep senior leadership up at night?
- What capabilities is the organization investing in?
- What's changing in our industry that requires new leadership?
- What does our enterprise strategy require that we don't have enough of?

**Sources:**

- CEO and Board communications
- Strategic planning documents
- All-hands presentations
- Industry analyst reports
- Competitive intelligence

**Common Enterprise Needs:**

- Digital transformation leadership
- Business-IT partnership
- Innovation and experimentation
- Risk management and compliance
- Change management and adoption
- Cost optimization and efficiency
- Talent development and retention
- Customer experience improvement

Document findings in: `resources/worksheets/market-needs-analysis.md`

#### Element 2: Your Values - What Matters to You

This is about authenticity and sustainability. Your brand must align with what you genuinely care about.

**Discovery Questions:**

- What aspects of your work give you energy vs. drain you?
- What issues or causes do you care deeply about?
- What do you want your legacy to be?
- What would you not compromise on, even for a promotion?
- What activities do you pursue outside work that reflect your values?

**Sources:**

- Psychometric test results (values components)
- Personal mission statements
- Activities you pursue voluntarily
- What you advocate for unprompted
- What you mentor others on naturally

**Common Leadership Values:**

- Innovation and continuous improvement
- People development and empowerment
- Operational excellence and quality
- Strategic thinking and planning
- Collaboration and partnership
- Integrity and ethical leadership
- Customer focus and service
- Results and accountability

Document findings in: `resources/worksheets/personal-values-inventory.md`

#### Element 3: Your Market Value - What You Are Good At

This is your demonstrated capability - what you've proven you can deliver.

**Discovery Questions:**

- What results have I consistently delivered?
- What do people seek me out for?
- What projects or initiatives have I led successfully?
- What feedback appears consistently in performance reviews?
- What skills or expertise differentiate me from peers?

**Sources:**

- Performance reviews and ratings
- Why people include you in meetings
- Projects you're asked to lead
- Expertise others attribute to you
- Promotions and stretch assignments you've received

**Common Leadership Capabilities:**

- Strategic planning and execution
- Stakeholder management and influence
- Technical expertise and innovation
- Change leadership and transformation
- Team building and development
- Problem-solving and analysis
- Communication and storytelling
- Operational excellence and delivery

Document findings in: `resources/worksheets/market-value-inventory.md`

### Finding Your Zone of Distinction

Your zone of distinction is the **intersection of all three elements.**

**The Venn Diagram Exercise:**

Use the template: `resources/templates/zone-of-distinction-venn.md`

1. Create three circles representing Market Need, Your Values, and Your Market Value
2. List items in each circle
3. Identify overlaps between any two circles
4. **Your zone of distinction is where all three circles overlap**

**Example Analysis:**

**Market Need:** Digital transformation, business-IT partnership, innovation
**Your Values:** People development, collaboration, continuous improvement
**Your Market Value:** Technical expertise, stakeholder management, change leadership

**Zone of Distinction:** *Technology-enabled business transformation leader who develops people through collaborative innovation*

### Authenticity Check: Which Identity Are You Showing?

Revisit Goffman's three identities:

- **Onstage:** Professional, polished, guarded
- **Backstage:** Authentic with trusted colleagues, more vulnerable
- **Offstage:** Private self, fully unguarded

**Critical Questions:**

- Which identity dominates your workplace presence?
- Is there so much distance between onstage and backstage that you seem inauthentic?
- Are you so unguarded that you lack professional gravitas?
- What would it look like to bring more of your backstage identity to onstage moments?

**Key Principle:** Be distinctive but authentic. You don't need to manufacture a persona. You need to figure out how you want others to see what already makes you distinctive.

## Part 4: Distill Aspirational and Anti-Brand Lists

### Creating Your Aspirational Brand List

Based on your zone of distinction, create a list of 5-8 characteristics that represent your aspirational brand.

**Guidelines:**

- Focus on **distinction**, not generic excellence
- Use specific, memorable language
- Avoid role expectations (everyone expects a CIO to be "strategic")
- Think about what makes you unique in your context
- Consider what characteristics look and feel like when applied

**Examples of Aspirational Brand Characteristics:**

Generic (Avoid) vs. Distinctive (Target):

| Generic | Distinctive |
|---------|-------------|
| Strategic thinker | Business outcome architect |
| Good communicator | Technical translator for executives |
| Team player | Cross-functional catalyst |
| Results-oriented | Bias-to-action change agent |
| Customer-focused | Customer obsession evangelist |
| Innovative | Experimentation champion |
| Dependable | Reliability multiplier |

**Aspirational Brand Examples by Role:**

**For CIOs:**

- Digital business co-creator (not just IT leader)
- Technology-enabled transformation partner
- Innovation portfolio curator
- Technical debt eliminator
- Data-driven decision enabler

**For Technical Leaders:**

- Architecture simplification advocate
- Developer experience champion
- Security-by-design practitioner
- Platform thinking evangelist
- Technical mentorship multiplier

**For Product/Business Leaders:**

- Customer journey optimizer
- Experimentation-driven decision maker
- Cross-functional alignment builder
- Outcome obsession leader
- Strategic roadmap storyteller

Document your list in: `resources/templates/aspirational-brand-list.md`

### Creating Your Anti-Brand List

Your anti-brand list is equally important - it defines what you need to **stop doing, delegate, or minimize**.

**Three Categories of Anti-Brand Items:**

#### 1. Pessimistic Perceptions That Concern You

Words or phrases from your brand discovery conversations that represent how you DON'T want to be seen:

- "Too detail-oriented" (if you want to be seen as strategic)
- "Risk-averse" (if you want to be seen as innovative)
- "Tactical executor" (if you want to be seen as strategic partner)
- "Slow to decide" (if you want to be seen as decisive)
- "Technical specialist" (if you want to be seen as business leader)

#### 2. Activities That Impede Your Aspirational Brand

Following Warren Buffett's "avoid at all costs" approach, list activities that:

- Take disproportionate time relative to strategic value
- Reinforce the brand you're trying to move away from
- Could be delegated or eliminated
- Keep you in tactical vs. strategic mode
- Prevent you from visibility with key stakeholders

**Examples:**

- Attending every operational status meeting
- Personally troubleshooting technical issues
- Reviewing every minor decision or document
- Being the primary point of contact for routine requests
- Focusing on perfection over timely delivery

#### 3. Inherited or Generic Brand Perceptions

Perceptions you've inherited that don't reflect your unique value:

- Default assumptions based on your role (e.g., "CIOs are cost-cutters")
- Brand characteristics of your predecessor
- Stereotypes about your function or department
- Generic descriptors that apply to anyone in your role
- Industry or company cultural defaults

**Examples:**

- "IT is the department of no"
- "Technology leaders are not business-savvy"
- "Back-office support function"
- "Cost center mentality"
- "Order takers who implement business requirements"

Document your list in: `resources/templates/anti-brand-list.md`

### Using Your Anti-Brand List

Your anti-brand list is actionable:

**For Pessimistic Perceptions:**

- Identify the behaviors that create these perceptions
- Create specific behavior change plans
- Request accountability partners to call out old patterns

**For Impeding Activities:**

- Delegate to develop others
- Eliminate low-value activities
- Set boundaries on time commitments
- Restructure meetings and communications

**For Inherited Perceptions:**

- Explicitly name and reframe them
- Create contrasting examples
- Tell stories that demonstrate the opposite
- Distance yourself from predecessors' brands

## Part 5: Craft Your Brand Promise

Your brand promise is the distillation of your aspirational brand into a **2-3 word statement** that represents the value or experiences your market can expect from you.

### From Brand Words to Brand Promise

Your brand promise should:

- Be **memorable and distinctive**
- Communicate **value to your market**
- Feel **authentic to your values**
- Reflect your **demonstrated capabilities**
- Differentiate you from peers
- Be appropriate for professional profiles, CV/resume, and how your enterprise describes you

### Brand Promise Formula

**[Role/Function] + [Distinctive Approach] + [Value Delivered]**

But compressed into 2-3 words maximum.

### Examples of Strong Brand Promises

**Generic (Avoid):**

- Dependable technologist
- Strategic IT leader
- Results-driven executive
- Innovative problem-solver

**Distinctive (Target):**

- Digital transformation catalyst
- Business technology partner
- Experimentation evangelist
- Technical debt eliminator
- Customer obsession champion
- Platform thinking architect
- Change acceleration leader
- Innovation portfolio curator

### Testing Your Brand Promise

Ask yourself:

1. **Distinction Test:** Could this apply to any of my peers, or is it uniquely me?
2. **Value Test:** Does this communicate what my market will experience or receive?
3. **Authenticity Test:** Can I sustain this brand consistently over time?
4. **Evidence Test:** Do I have proof points from my track record?
5. **Aspirational Test:** Does this represent where I'm going, not just where I've been?

**If you answer "no" to any question, refine your brand promise.**

### Operationalizing Your Brand Promise

Once defined, your brand promise should appear in:

- **LinkedIn headline and summary**
- **Resume/CV professional summary**
- **Internal bio and profile**
- **Introduction templates** (email signatures, meeting intros)
- **Performance review self-assessments**
- **Promotion and project nomination materials**
- **Executive sponsor descriptions**

### Brand Promise Worksheet

Use the guided worksheet to develop your brand promise:
`resources/worksheets/brand-promise-development.md`

This worksheet includes:

- Aspirational brand word consolidation
- Value proposition mapping
- Distinctive language testing
- Final brand promise statement
- Operationalization checklist

## Recalibration vs. Reinvention

Most leaders need **recalibration**, not **reinvention**.

### Recalibration: Intentional Adjustment

**When to recalibrate:**

- Your current brand is mostly accurate but emphasizes the wrong elements
- You have the right capabilities but wrong visibility
- Your brand served you well in a previous role but needs updating
- Feedback shows a gap between how you want to be seen and how you're perceived

**What recalibration looks like:**

- Amplifying certain existing strengths
- Minimizing (not eliminating) other capabilities
- Shifting the balance of where you spend time
- Adjusting communication style for different impact
- Reframing your expertise in business value terms

**Example:**
Current brand: "Technical expert who ensures system reliability"
Recalibrated brand: "Business continuity strategist who leverages technical architecture"

*Same capabilities, different emphasis and framing.*

### Reinvention: Fundamental Transformation

**When to reinvent:**

- Major career pivot (function change, industry shift)
- Significant skill gaps for aspirational brand
- Current brand is fundamentally misaligned with values
- Toxic brand requiring complete reset

**What reinvention looks like:**

- Acquiring new skills and credentials
- Changing roles or functions
- Building entirely new networks
- Potentially changing organizations
- Multi-year development journey

**Most executive presence development is recalibration, not reinvention.**

## Common Brand Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: "I'm Seen as Too Technical"

**Common in:** CIOs, CTOs, technical leaders moving to business leadership

**Symptoms:**

- Excluded from business strategy conversations
- Seen as implementer, not partner
- Feedback about being "in the weeds"
- Asked for feasibility assessments, not strategic input

**Recalibration Strategy:**

1. **Shift language from technical to business outcomes**
   - Before: "We need to modernize our API architecture"
   - After: "We can reduce time-to-market by 40% through platform modernization"

2. **Delegate technical deep-dives**
   - Stop being the primary technical problem-solver
   - Develop your team's technical leadership
   - Reserve your technical expertise for strategic architecture decisions

3. **Increase business acumen visibility**
   - Participate in business planning, not just IT planning
   - Present in business terms (revenue, cost, customer experience)
   - Build relationships with business leaders outside of project work

4. **Reframe your expertise**
   - From: Technical architecture expert
   - To: Digital capability strategist

### Challenge 2: "I'm Seen as Not Strategic"

**Common in:** High-performing operators, delivery-focused leaders

**Symptoms:**

- Excluded from long-term planning
- Seen as "gets things done" but not "thinks ahead"
- Feedback about being tactical or reactive
- Not invited to strategy sessions

**Recalibration Strategy:**

1. **Connect tactical work to strategic objectives**
   - Start every update with "This supports [strategic goal]"
   - Frame deliverables in terms of enterprise strategy
   - Decline work that doesn't advance strategic priorities

2. **Increase visibility in strategic forums**
   - Request attendance at planning sessions
   - Submit strategic recommendations unsolicited
   - Present forward-looking analysis, not just status updates

3. **Demonstrate long-term thinking**
   - Share industry trends and implications
   - Propose multi-year roadmaps
   - Discuss risks and opportunities beyond current quarter

4. **Delegate operational excellence**
   - Develop team members to own operational execution
   - Focus your time on strategic initiatives
   - Reserve execution involvement for strategic projects

### Challenge 3: "I'm Seen as Indecisive"

**Common in:** Consensus-builders, analytical leaders, conflict-avoiders

**Symptoms:**

- Feedback about "analysis paralysis"
- Seen as too collaborative or unable to make tough calls
- Decisions get delayed or delegated upward
- Team or stakeholders frustrated by lack of clarity

**Recalibration Strategy:**

1. **Establish decision-making frameworks**
   - Define criteria for decisions in advance
   - Set deadlines for input collection
   - Communicate decision approach transparently
   - Use "disagree and commit" for stakeholder alignment

2. **Make smaller decisions faster**
   - Identify low-risk decisions you can accelerate
   - Document decision rationale (build confidence)
   - Celebrate and communicate quick wins

3. **Distinguish collaboration from consensus**
   - Seek input, but own the decision
   - Frame as "I've decided based on..." not "We all agree..."
   - Be explicit: "I'm seeking input" vs. "I'm making a decision"

4. **Communicate decisions proactively**
   - Don't wait for perfect certainty
   - Explain decision with rationale
   - Include what you're willing to adjust based on learning

### Challenge 4: "I'm Seen as Abrasive or Lacking Empathy"

**Common in:** Direct communicators, results-driven leaders, high performers

**Symptoms:**

- Feedback about being "too direct" or "harsh"
- Team members seem hesitant or defensive
- Seen as caring more about results than people
- 360 feedback shows relationship challenges

**Recalibration Strategy:**

1. **Add context before critique**
   - Start with intent: "I want to help you succeed..."
   - Acknowledge effort before addressing gaps
   - Frame feedback as development, not judgment

2. **Increase visible empathy behaviors**
   - Ask about challenges before discussing results
   - Acknowledge personal situations affecting work
   - Show appreciation more frequently
   - Check in on well-being, not just deliverables

3. **Adjust communication pace**
   - Slow down in difficult conversations
   - Pause for reactions and input
   - Ask questions before making statements
   - Use "What are you thinking?" more often

4. **Maintain high standards with high support**
   - Don't lower expectations, increase support
   - Frame as "I believe you can..." not "You failed to..."
   - Provide resources and coaching, not just feedback

### Challenge 5: "I'm Inheriting a Negative Brand"

**Common in:** New leaders replacing unpopular predecessors, function rebranding

**Symptoms:**

- Assumptions based on previous leader's brand
- Defensive or skeptical stakeholders
- Low trust or credibility despite your capabilities
- Feedback about "the old way" when you're trying something new

**Recalibration Strategy:**

1. **Explicitly acknowledge and contrast**
   - "I know this function has historically..."
   - "I want to do things differently by..."
   - "Here's what will change and what will stay the same"

2. **Demonstrate contrasting behaviors quickly**
   - Identify the most problematic predecessor behaviors
   - Do the opposite visibly and consistently
   - Tell stories that illustrate the contrast

3. **Reset relationships proactively**
   - Have individual conversations with key stakeholders
   - Ask: "What hasn't worked well? What do you need?"
   - Make early wins visible to build credibility

4. **Create psychological distance**
   - Avoid "my predecessor did..." language
   - Establish new norms and rituals
   - Bring in fresh perspectives and advisors
   - Rebrand team/function if appropriate

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Start with radical self-awareness** - Most leaders overestimate how well they're perceived
2. **Seek advice, not feedback** - Advice is more critical and actionable than polite feedback
3. **Listen without defending** - Your job in discovery is to understand, not justify
4. **Focus on distinction over excellence** - Being memorable beats being generically good
5. **Align with authentic values** - Unsustainable brands collapse under pressure
6. **Recalibrate, don't reinvent** - Most leaders need adjustment, not transformation
7. **Eliminate the anti-brand** - What you stop doing is as important as what you start
8. **Be patient with perception change** - Brand shifts take 6-18 months of consistent behavior
9. **Measure impact, not just impressions** - Executive presence is proven through what people do
10. **Iterate based on feedback** - Brands evolve; revisit your discovery process annually

## Key Takeaways

- Executive presence is not charisma. It's the intentional alignment of image, impressions, and impact to create influence.
- 90% of leaders think they have executive presence, but only 15% are actually self-aware about how others perceive them.
- Your current brand exists whether you've intentionally created it or not. Discovering it is the first step.
- Your zone of distinction is where market needs, your values, and your market value intersect.
- Brand distinction precedes brand esteem. Be memorable and different, not generically excellent.
- Most leaders need recalibration (intentional adjustment) rather than reinvention (fundamental transformation).
- Your anti-brand list (what to stop doing) is as important as your aspirational brand list.
- Your brand promise should be 2-3 words that communicate distinctive value to your market.
- Sustainable brands are authentic - aligned with your values and demonstrated capabilities.
- Brand change takes time and consistency. Plan for 6-18 months of deliberate behavior change.
