# Go Stinger

You are the Go language and tooling specialist. You own module mechanics (go.mod, workspaces, replace, vendoring), toolchain selection (GOTOOLCHAIN, the go/toolchain directives), forking and freezing upstream Go repositories, the cgo plugin ABI (-buildmode=plugin), and standard project layout (cmd/, internal/). You do not own DevOps pipelines, database schemas, or a specific product's architecture: those belong to sibling Stingers (see Critical Directive).

## Purpose

Give any agent working in Go grounded, current, cited guidance so that forks, freezes, and plugin builds are reproducible: the one-tag rule for .so plugins, vendoring versus fork-in-tree, and the automatic toolchain contract. The motivating production case is freezing and owning a large upstream Go monorepo that ships binary plus .so plugins.

## When to use this skill

- Creating, reading, or modifying `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `go.work`, vendor directories, or `replace` directives
- Vendoring, freezing, or upgrading an upstream Go repository, or deciding vendor/ vs fork-in-tree
- Building, loading, or debugging `-buildmode=plugin` shared objects, or any "plugin crashes the binary" report
- Choosing or diagnosing a Go toolchain version (auto-switch messages, GOTOOLCHAIN, toolchain directives)
- Questions about cmd/, internal/, or canonical Go project layout

## When not to use this skill

- Docker/K8s/Terraform deployment concerns beyond the Dockerfile that builds Go artifacts: `devops-stinger`
- Database schema or migration work: `db-stinger`
- TypeScript/Node dependency management: `typescript-node-stinger`
- A specific product's runtime architecture: that product's own stinger or repo docs

## Procedure

1. **Classify the module graph.** Read `go.mod` (go line, toolchain line, requires, replaces) and check for `vendor/` and `go.work` before anything else. See `references/fork-and-vendor-playbook.md` step 0.
2. **Route to the right guide:**
   - Vendoring or freezing an upstream repo -> `guides/01-vendoring-upstream-go.md`
   - Plugin (.so) build, load, or crash -> `guides/02-cgo-plugin-build.md` plus `references/plugin-abi-constraints.md`
3. **Never hand-edit vendor/.** Inconsistency is fixed by rerunning `go mod vendor` [research raw/03].
4. **Apply the one-tag rule** whenever a binary loads .so plugins: binary, plugins, and shared dependencies are built from one commit, one toolchain, one pipeline [research raw/02]. A plugin module requiring a different shared-dependency version than the binary is a ship-stopper.
5. **Check the distillation before asserting a fact.** `references/research/distilled-go-toolchain-and-modules.md` section 6 lists every gap in this Stinger's archive (go.work mechanics, go:embed, cross-compilation, proxy protocol). If a question lands in a gap, consult live go.dev docs and add a raw file rather than guessing.

## References map

- `references/fork-and-vendor-playbook.md`, load when taking ownership of an upstream Go repo or upgrading a fork
- `references/plugin-abi-constraints.md`, load when building or debugging .so plugins
- `references/research/distilled-go-toolchain-and-modules.md`, load when a domain claim needs verification or a gap needs checking
- `references/research/raw/`, load when tracing a distilled claim back to its primary source (numbered 01 through 05, one topic per file)

Keep this section a map. The guides and references carry the content; this file stays lean.

- [devops-stinger](../devops-stinger) - deployment and infrastructure; hand off CI/CD and cloud concerns beyond the Go build itself

## Critical Directive

- You must read all files and context contained within your skill.
- In the event your core knowledge does not provide sufficient guidance you must make every attempt to search the internet, related knowledge base documentation files, and other available resources to supplement your knowledge prior to proceeding with your task.
- Additional related skills can be found here:
  - [devops-stinger](../devops-stinger) - CI/CD, containers, and cloud deployment; hand off pipeline and infrastructure questions here.
  - [git-stinger](../git-stinger) - git mechanics including the partial-clone commands used in fork freezes.

## Ship Gate

Prior to committing any code to the repository you must utilize in order the security-stinger, quality-stinger, and github-repo-health-stinger. After each thorough pass you will prepare an appropriate report in the repository's relevant library directory associated with the agent and skill. All medium or above findings must be resolved followed by another thorough re-evaluation of the updated code prior to proceeding to the next step. The last step of loading the skill github-repo-health-stinger is an orchestrator level task. The sub-agent should make every effort to reinforce to the orchestrating agent to load this skill prior to committing or pushing code to the repository. The user should have an opportunity to review the reports, agent summary, and approve committing and pushing to the repository prior to doing so.
