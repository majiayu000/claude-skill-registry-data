## State Legitimacy

### Social Contract Theories

```
SOCIAL CONTRACT TRADITION
═════════════════════════

HOBBES (1588-1679)
├── State of nature: War of all against all
├── Life: "Solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, short"
├── Contract: Give up freedom for security
└── Result: Absolute sovereign (Leviathan)

LOCKE (1632-1704)
├── State of nature: Peace with inconveniences
├── Natural rights: Life, liberty, property
├── Contract: Limited government to protect rights
└── Result: Liberal constitutional state

ROUSSEAU (1712-1778)
├── State of nature: Noble savage, corrupted by society
├── Problem: How to be free yet bound by law?
├── Solution: General will (not will of all)
└── Result: Direct democracy, civic virtue
```

### Contemporary Social Contract

**Rawls**: Hypothetical contract behind veil of ignorance
**Gauthier**: Bargaining among rational self-interested agents
**Scanlon**: Principles no one could reasonably reject

## Justice

### Rawls's Theory

```
RAWLSIAN JUSTICE
════════════════

ORIGINAL POSITION
├── Hypothetical choice situation
├── Veil of ignorance: Don't know your place
├── Rational, self-interested choosers
└── What principles would you choose?

TWO PRINCIPLES
1. LIBERTY PRINCIPLE
   └── Equal basic liberties for all
   └── Speech, conscience, association, etc.

2. DIFFERENCE PRINCIPLE
   └── Inequalities only if they benefit worst-off
   └── With fair equality of opportunity

PRIORITY:
Liberty > Fair opportunity > Difference principle
```

### Alternative Theories

| Theory | Key Thinker | Principle |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Utilitarianism | Mill | Maximize total welfare |
| Libertarianism | Nozick | Minimal state, property rights |
| Communitarianism | Sandel, MacIntyre | Community shapes justice |
| Capabilities | Sen, Nussbaum | Ensure capabilities for all |

### Nozick's Entitlement Theory

```
LIBERTARIAN JUSTICE
═══════════════════

JUSTICE IN ACQUISITION
├── How did you originally get it?
└── Must be legitimate

JUSTICE IN TRANSFER
├── Voluntary exchange
└── Gift, sale, etc.

RECTIFICATION
├── Correct past injustices
└── Compensation, restitution

MINIMAL STATE
├── Only protection services
├── No redistribution
└── "Taxation is forced labor"
```

### Republican Liberty

**Non-Domination** (Pettit):
- Freedom as absence of arbitrary power over you
- Not just non-interference
- Slave with kind master is still unfree
