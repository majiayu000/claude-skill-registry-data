# Partner Revenue Desk Skill

## When to Use
- Forecasting partner-sourced/ influenced revenue for leadership updates.
- Monitoring incentives, SPIFs, and MDF utilization tied to partner pipeline.
- Coordinating RevOps, finance, and partner teams on attribution disputes.

## Framework
1. **Revenue Taxonomy** – sourced vs influenced vs co-sell, stage definitions, SLAs.
2. **Process Flow** – intake → validation → attribution → approval → reporting.
3. **Data Stack** – CRM objects, PRM integrations, BI dashboards, alerting.
4. **Incentive Hooks** – payout rules, MDF governance, exception workflows.
5. **Escalation Paths** – playbooks for disputes, double counting, or compliance risks.

## Templates
- Revenue desk runbook with RACI + cadence.
- Attribution audit checklist.
- MDF utilization tracker with projected ROI.

## Tips
- Align definitions with finance early; lock requirements before launching SPIFs.
- Automate alerts for stalled partner deals to keep velocity high.
- Pair with `build-co-sell-playbook` and `run-partner-qbr` for closed-loop reporting.
