### L1 Improvement
- Rebuilt the extractor SOP using Prompt Architect constraint ordering and Skill Forge structure-first guardrails.
- Added clear triggers, input/output contracts, and confidence ceilings with memory tagging.
- Clarified validation for fidelity (no hallucinations) and reusability.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
Identify, isolate, and package reusable templates (prompts, code snippets, docs, configs) from existing artifacts while preserving fidelity and context.

### Trigger Conditions
- **Positive:** requests to extract reusable templates/patterns, generate starter kits, or refactor repetitive content.
- **Negative:** net-new template design (route to prompt-architect/skill-forge) or full refactors without reuse focus.

### Guardrails
- Structure-first docs maintained (SKILL, README, improvement summary, references, scripts).
- Evidence-first extraction: cite source paths and lines; avoid hallucinated additions.
- Confidence ceilings mandatory; flag uncertain sections for review.
- Memory tagging for extracted templates and provenance.

### Execution Phases
1. **Intent & Scope** – Define artifact type (prompt/code/doc/config), success criteria, and allowed modifications.
2. **Source Collection** – Locate canonical files; gather context (dependencies, environment, licenses).
3. **Extraction** – Isolate template blocks with placeholders; annotate variables and constraints.
4. **Normalization** – Standardize structure (front matter, parameters, steps), add usage notes.
5. **Validation** – Verify fidelity against source; run lint/tests if applicable; check licensing.
6. **Delivery** – Provide template files, provenance, usage guidance, and confidence line.

### Output Format
- Template(s) with placeholders/parameters and usage instructions.
- Provenance (paths/lines), constraints, and compatibility notes.
- Validation results and open questions.
- Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY) and memory keys used.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Source paths cited; no hallucinated content.
- [ ] Placeholders/parameters documented with defaults.
- [ ] Licensing/compatibility noted.
- [ ] Memory tagged and artifacts stored.
- [ ] Confidence ceiling declared.

### Integration
- **Scripts:** automation helpers in `scripts/`.
- **Memory MCP:** `skills/tooling/template-extractor/{project}/{timestamp}` for extracted templates and provenance.
- **Hooks:** follow Skill Forge latency bounds; integrate with validation tools as needed.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) – SOP aligned to Prompt Architect clarity and Skill Forge guardrails.
