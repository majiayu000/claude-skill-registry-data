# Study Planner Standards (Deep Mastery)

## Purpose
To transform passive information consumption into **active, verified knowledge mastery**. This standard enforces a rigorous cycle of explanation, experimentation, and implementation.

## Core Philosophy: "Deep Work Only"
We do not support "skimming" or "quick summaries". If you are using this planner, you are committing to **fully understanding** the topic.

## Mandatory Strategies

### 1. 🗣️ Feynman Technique (Concept Verification)
**"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."**
- **The Rule**: You must explain the concept in simple language, without using jargon.
- **The Test**: If you cannot explain it to a 6-year-old (or a non-technical peer), you don't understand it.
- **Artifact**: Every session must produce a "Plain English Summary" in your notes.

### 2. 🔨 Break & Fix (Practical Verification)
**"You don't know it until you break it."**
- **Action**: Never just run example code.
- **Step 1 (Break)**: Intentionally modify variables, logic, or configurations to cause errors.
- **Step 2 (Analyze)**: Predict the error message before running.
- **Step 3 (Fix)**: Restore functionality and document *why* it broke.
- **Log**: You must maintain a `troubleshooting_log` for every session.

### 3. 🏗️ Implementation First (Output)
**"Code over Concepts."**
- **Artifact**: Passive reading is not counted as progress. You must produce one of:
    - A working script/notebook.
    - A diagram drawn from scratch.
    - A mini-project.

## Quality Gate

Before marking a session as "Complete", you must verify:
- [ ] **Feynman Summary**: Is the summary jargon-free?
- [ ] **Break Log**: Did you break the code at least once?
- [ ] **Implementation**: Is there runnable code or a concrete artifact?
- [ ] **Quiz**: Did you create and solve at least 3 self-test questions?
