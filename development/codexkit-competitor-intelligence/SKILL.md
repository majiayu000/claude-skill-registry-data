# Competitive Intelligence Analyst

## When to Use

- When launching a new product and need to understand competitive landscape
- When sales teams need competitive battle cards
- During quarterly strategic reviews
- When a new competitor enters the market

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Define Intelligence Requirements

1. Which competitors to profile? (direct, indirect, emerging)
2. Which dimensions to analyze? (product, pricing, positioning, market share, funding)
3. What decisions will this intelligence inform?
4. Audience: sales, product, executive, board?

### Step 2 — Competitor Profiles

For each competitor, build a profile:
- Company overview (size, funding, geography)
- Product/service offering
- Target customer and ICP
- Pricing model and known price points
- Go-to-market strategy
- Key strengths and weaknesses
- Recent moves (launches, hires, partnerships, funding)

### Step 3 — Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Feature 1 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Feature 2 | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Pricing | $$$ | $$ | $$$$ | $ |

### Step 4 — Positioning Map

Plot competitors on a 2×2 perceptual map using two key dimensions:
- X-axis: e.g., Price (Low → High)
- Y-axis: e.g., Capability (Basic → Enterprise)

### Step 5 — Win/Loss Analysis

| Scenario | We Won | We Lost | Pattern |
|----------|--------|---------|---------|
| vs Competitor A | 60% | 40% | We win on features, lose on price |
| vs Competitor B | 45% | 55% | They win on brand, we win on support |

### Step 6 — Counter-Strategies

For each competitor, define:
- How to position against them
- Key talking points for sales
- Features/capabilities to highlight
- Objection handling for their strengths

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Format |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Competitor list | Yes | Names and categories |
| Dimensions to track | Yes | List of comparison areas |
| Internal product data | Yes | Features, pricing, positioning |
| Win/loss data | Recommended | Deal outcomes by competitor |

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] All claims reference specific frameworks, standards, or quantifiable data
- [ ] Content matches the stated audience's expertise level
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable — each includes a concrete next step
- [ ] No unsupported assertions or generic filler language

## Verification (4C)

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Do referenced frameworks and standards match their official definitions? |
| **Completeness** | Are all key concepts covered without significant gaps for the stated audience? |
| **Context-fit** | Would this be useful for someone new to this domain, or is it too advanced/too basic? |
| **Consequence** | If a stakeholder acted on this immediately, what could they misinterpret? |

## Edge Cases

- **Conflicting frameworks** — State which framework takes precedence and why. Document the trade-off explicitly.
- **Rapidly changing domain** — Note information currency date. Flag sections likely to need updates.
- **Audience has mixed expertise levels** — Provide a glossary and mark advanced sections as optional.
