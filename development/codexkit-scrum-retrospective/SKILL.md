# Sprint Retrospective Facilitator

## Purpose

Turn sprint reflections into structured improvement actions by choosing the right retrospective format, guiding the session, and producing trackable outcomes.

## When to use

- after every sprint to reflect on process and teamwork
- when team morale or velocity is declining and root causes are unclear
- when previous retro action items keep recurring without resolution
- when onboarding a new Scrum Master who needs facilitation structure

## When not to use

- individual performance evaluation or disciplinary review
- project-level strategic retrospectives (use lessons-learned skill)
- mid-sprint debugging sessions

## Inputs

- sprint number and duration
- sprint goal and whether it was met
- velocity or throughput data (current + last 3 sprints)
- previous retro action items and their completion status
- team size and maturity level (forming / storming / norming / performing)
- any specific incidents or friction points to address

## Procedure

1. **Select format** based on team maturity:
   - Forming (< 3 sprints): Start / Stop / Continue
   - Storming (3–10 sprints): 4Ls — Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For
   - Norming (stable team): Sailboat — Wind / Anchors / Rocks / Island
   - Performing (high trust): Lean Coffee, ORID, Timeline Retro
   - Crisis / specific problem: Fishbone + 5 Whys
2. **Set the stage** (10 min): Run ESVP check (Explorer/Shopper/Vacationer/Prisoner), review working agreements, safety check (1–5 scale).
3. **Gather data** (20 min): Build sprint timeline of key events, review velocity trend and defect rate.
4. **Generate insights** (25 min): Dot voting (3 dots per person), affinity clustering, 5 Whys on top-voted issue.
5. **Decide actions** (25 min): Maximum 3 action items. Each: What + Who + Done-by-when + Success criteria. Check carryover from last retro.
6. **Close** (10 min): Team health pulse (1–5 on 3 dimensions), appreciation round, retro-of-the-retro score.

## Output

- retro summary with format used and key data gathered
- action items table: What | Owner | Due Date | Success Criteria | Status
- team health index trend (tracked across sprints)
- carryover escalation if same item recurs 3+ times without resolution

## Definition of done

- maximum 3 action items, each with a named owner and due date
- team health pulse recorded
- previous retro carryover items are reviewed and their status documented
- output is shareable with stakeholders within 24 hours

## Examples

- "Run a retrospective for Sprint 8 with a norming team of 6 — velocity dropped 15% this sprint."
- "Our last 3 retros had the same 'unclear requirements' action item. Help us escalate."
- "Facilitate a Fishbone retro to investigate why the deployment failed last sprint."

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] Feedback is specific and references exact locations in the reviewed material
- [ ] Each critique includes a concrete improvement suggestion
- [ ] Severity is categorized (critical / important / nice-to-have)
- [ ] Positive aspects are acknowledged alongside areas for improvement

## Verification (4C)

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Is the feedback technically accurate and properly contextualized? |
| **Completeness** | Were all major sections of the reviewed material addressed? |
| **Context-fit** | Is the review granularity appropriate for the material's maturity level? |
| **Consequence** | If the author implemented all feedback literally, what could go wrong? |

## Edge Cases

- **Material is too early-stage for detailed review** — Provide structural feedback only. Note that content review is deferred until it matures.
- **Reviewer lacks domain expertise** — Focus on structure, clarity, and consistency. Flag domain-specific claims as 'Needs SME verification'.
- **Author is defensive or resistant to feedback** — Lead with what works well. Frame changes as questions rather than mandates.

## Changelog
