# Refactor: Scope Session

Define precise boundaries for a refactoring cycle.

## Scoping Checklist

### 1. Goals Definition
- What specific improvement are we targeting?
- What metrics will improve?

### 2. Boundaries (IN Scope)
- Which files/modules will be touched?
- What types of changes are allowed?

### 3. Boundaries (OUT of Scope)
- Which areas must NOT change?
- What behaviors must remain identical?

### 4. Success Criteria
- How do we know refactoring succeeded?
- What tests must pass?

## Principles

1. Smaller is safer
2. One goal per session
3. Define done upfront
4. Preserve behavior
