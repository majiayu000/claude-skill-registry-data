## Where to Add Security Skills in README

- **Penetration testing tools**: `Cybersecurity & Penetration Testing`
- **Code analysis tools**: `Security & Systems` or `Development & Code Tools`
- **Threat hunting**: `Security & Systems`
- **Smart contract security**: `Development & Code Tools` (if dev-focused)

## Security Skill Best Practices

1. **Clear scope**: Define what the skill does and doesn't do
2. **Legal warnings**: Include responsible use disclaimers
3. **Tool requirements**: List required external tools
4. **Safe defaults**: Use non-destructive operations by default
5. **Logging**: Include audit trail capabilities
