# Grill

## Overview

Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of a plan or design until you reach a **shared understanding**. Walk down each branch of the decision tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

The goal is not to reach agreement quickly — it is to make every implicit call explicit, so nothing important is left silently assumed.

Grilling is an interview, not an execution — it produces alignment, not artifacts. Every decision surfaced and settled is what the `spec` stage synthesizes afterward.

## When to Use

- User says "grill me", "stress-test this plan", "poke holes in this", "harden this design"
- A plan feels roughly right but unresolved decisions are hiding in it
- Before writing a spec (pre-spec hardening)
- User wants to find soft spots in a design before committing to code
- Before any S2/S3 build — and any S1 build whose ask is ambiguous — where the plan is still fuzzy and the domain language isn't settled (routing: `orchestrator/references/risk-routing.md`)

**Don't use for:**

- Plans that are already fully specified — go straight to the `spec` stage
- Simple, unambiguous tasks
- Post-hoc code review (use the `review-commit` stage)

## The Decision Tree

The mental model is a **decision tree**: every plan branches into decisions, and decisions depend on each other. Grilling descends that tree round by round, so an early answer can reshape which questions come next.

```
        Plan
       /    \
   Decision A   Decision B (depends on A)
   /     \           |
  A1     A2         B1
  |                   |
  ...               ...
```

## Frontier rounds

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled — the questions you can ask *now* without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Format a round like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>

---

❓ **Q2** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Each round's answers reshape the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock the questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a *later* round, not this one.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the decision tree visited, nothing left silently assumed.

## Rules

### One question at a time

Frontier rounds replace the old strictly-one-at-a-time model, but the underlying rule still bites: a user who is handed the entire decision tree at once is bewildered and loses the structure that makes the interview converge. A round contains the whole unlocked frontier and nothing more — every question a numbered entry the user answers directly. A question whose answer depends on another still-open question waits for a later round.

### Provide a recommended answer

Each question comes with **your recommended answer**. The user reacts to a proposal, not a blank prompt. This makes the interview faster and surfaces your reasoning for the user to correct.

Word each question so "yes" accepts the recommended answer: "I recommend 15 minutes because the spec says security-first — agree? (yes = 15 minutes)". A "yes"-accepting question turns a round of answers into a round of confirmations.

### Facts vs decisions

If a *fact* can be found by exploring the environment (filesystem, tools, codebase, docs), **look it up rather than asking**. Finding a fact is your job, never the user's: when a frontier question needs a fact from the environment, dispatch a subagent to look it up — never ask the user for anything you could retrieve yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the subagent to report; ask the rest of the frontier now. The *decisions*, though, are the user's — put each one to them and wait for their answer.

### Dependency order

Resolve parent decisions before children. An early answer may close off branches or open new ones. Don't ask about B if B depends on A and A is unresolved — B's questions join the round after A is settled.

Recompute the frontier every round: settled decisions push it outward and unblock the questions that depended on them; an answer that opens new sub-decisions puts those sub-decisions on the next frontier.

### Don't act until confirmed

Do not act on the plan until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding. Grilling is an interview, not an execution — it produces alignment, not code.

## Process

1. **Understand the plan.** Read the conversation context. If the user references a file (spec, design doc, issue), fetch and read it first.

2. **Map the decision tree.** Identify the major decisions and their dependencies. Don't share this map — just use it to order your rounds.

3. **Ask a round.** Walk the tree one frontier at a time: compute the frontier — every decision whose prerequisites are settled. Ask all of it in one numbered round, each question with a recommended answer. Dispatch subagent lookups for any retrievable facts (see *Facts vs decisions*) and ask the questions that don't depend on them now. Wait for the answers.

4. **Recompute the frontier.** Fold each answer in: settled decisions unblock their dependents; answers that opened new sub-decisions put them on the next frontier. Ask the next round. Repeat until nothing is left.

5. **Confirm shared understanding.** When all branches are visited, summarize the resolved decisions and ask: "Have we reached a shared understanding? Should I proceed to [spec/plan/implementation]?"

## What makes a good grilling question

- **Specific, not abstract.** "Should the auth token expire after 15 minutes or 24 hours?" > "What are your thoughts on auth?"
- **Recommends, doesn't defer.** "I recommend 15 minutes because the spec says security-first. Agree?" > "How long should the token last?"
- **Resolves, doesn't explore.** Each question should settle something, not open a rambling discussion.
- **One decision per question.** Don't bundle "Should we use Redis AND should the TTL be 1 hour?" into one question.

## Completion Criteria

- Every major decision branch in the tree has been visited
- Each resolved decision has a clear answer (not "we'll figure it out later")
- The frontier is empty — nothing left silently assumed
- The user has confirmed shared understanding
- No decision depends on an unresolved parent

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Firehosing questions.** A round is the whole *unlocked frontier*, and only the frontier — dumping the entire decision tree in one message, or bundling questions that depend on still-open answers, overwhelms the user and loses the dependency structure. Numbered frontier rounds, always.

2. **Asking about facts.** "What version of Python does this project use?" — read the `pyproject.toml` instead. Dispatch a subagent for any retrievable fact; only ask the user about decisions.

3. **Not providing a recommendation.** A blank prompt forces the user to do your work. Always propose an answer with reasoning, worded so "yes" accepts it.

4. **Acting mid-grill.** Starting to write code or files before the user confirms shared understanding. Grilling is an interview, not execution.

5. **Skipping branches.** Not visiting a decision because it seems trivial. Trivial decisions made implicitly are the ones that bite later.

6. **Not recursing.** When the user's answer opens a new sub-decision, moving on without putting it on the next frontier.

## Where it fits

Grill is the **pre-spec hardening step** of the dev-pipeline pipeline. It comes before `spec`:

- Plan fuzzy → grill here first.
- Plan already clear → skip straight to the `spec` stage — `spec` synthesizes what's already known, it doesn't interview.
- Residual ambiguity after the spec is saved is resolved by the spec stage's inline **clarify** phase (`[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers resolved with the user, answers folded back into the spec) — run after spec, before planning.

The canonical chain diagram and the whole-pipeline flow map live in the pipeline's orchestrator stage; this stage is the front door for building anything non-trivial.

If doubt surfaces *while executing* an already-agreed plan — the user is mid-build and skeptical of a step — that is `doubt-driven-development`'s discipline with its own trigger, not a re-grill. Load that skill instead.
