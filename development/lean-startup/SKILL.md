# Lean Startup Methodology

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- **Lean Startup tasks** - Working on apply lean startup methodology for validated learning. guides build-measure-learn cycles, mvp definition, hypothesis testing, and pivot/persevere decisions
- **Planning or design** - Need guidance on Lean Startup approaches
- **Best practices** - Want to follow established patterns and standards

## Overview

Lean Startup is a methodology for developing businesses and products that aims to shorten product development cycles and rapidly discover if a proposed business model is viable. It emphasizes validated learning through experimentation over elaborate planning.

## Core Principles

### 1. Validated Learning

Learning through systematic experimentation rather than assumptions. Every product decision should be based on evidence, not opinions.

### 2. Build-Measure-Learn

The fundamental feedback loop:

```text
       ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
       │                                         │
       ▼                                         │
   ┌───────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌───────┐      │
   │ BUILD │────▶│ MEASURE │────▶│ LEARN │──────┘
   └───────┘     └─────────┘     └───────┘
       │
       └── Start with IDEAS, end with DATA
```

**Build**: Create the minimum needed to test a hypothesis
**Measure**: Collect data on what users actually do
**Learn**: Analyze data to validate or invalidate hypothesis

### 3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The smallest thing you can build that allows you to learn something meaningful.

**MVP Types**:

- **Concierge MVP**: Manually deliver the service to understand needs
- **Wizard of Oz MVP**: Appear automated, but manual behind the scenes
- **Landing Page MVP**: Test demand before building anything
- **Explainer Video MVP**: Demonstrate concept to gauge interest
- **Piecemeal MVP**: Combine existing tools to simulate product
- **Single Feature MVP**: Build one core feature only

## Hypothesis Framework

### Leap of Faith Assumptions

Every startup rests on untested assumptions. Identify the most critical ones:

1. **Value Hypothesis**: Will users find the product valuable?
2. **Growth Hypothesis**: Will the product grow through word of mouth, virality, or paid channels?

### Hypothesis Template

```text
We believe that [specific user segment]
will [take specific action]
because [reason/motivation]

We will know this is true when we see [measurable outcome]
```

### Example

```text
We believe that enterprise developers
will pay $50/month for AI code review
because they spend 20% of time on manual reviews

We will know this is true when we see:
- 10% conversion from free trial
- 70% monthly retention rate
- NPS score > 40
```

## MVP Definition Process

### Step 1: Identify Riskiest Assumptions

List all assumptions your product relies on:

- Users have this problem
- Users will pay to solve it
- We can reach these users
- We can build this at acceptable cost
- This solution will work

**Prioritize by**: Risk × Impact

### Step 2: Design Minimum Experiment

For each risky assumption, design the smallest experiment to test it:

| Assumption | Experiment Type | Success Metric | Duration |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| Users have problem | Interviews (20) | 80% confirm | 2 weeks |
| Users will pay | Pre-sales page | 5% conversion | 1 week |
| Solution works | Concierge MVP | 3 engaged users | 3 weeks |

### Step 3: Build MVP

**MVP Scope Checklist**:

- [ ] Addresses exactly one core assumption
- [ ] Can be built in 1-4 weeks
- [ ] Has clear success/failure criteria
- [ ] Produces actionable learning
- [ ] Costs acceptable amount to validate

### Step 4: Measure

**Actionable Metrics** (use these):

- Conversion rates at each funnel stage
- Cohort retention rates
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- Time to value

**Vanity Metrics** (avoid these):

- Total users (without activation)
- Page views (without conversions)
- Downloads (without usage)
- Registered accounts (without engagement)

## Pivot or Persevere

### Decision Framework

After each Build-Measure-Learn cycle:

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Analyze Experiment Results              │
└───────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                            │
            ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
            ▼                               ▼
    ┌───────────────┐               ┌───────────────┐
    │ Hypothesis    │               │ Hypothesis    │
    │ VALIDATED     │               │ INVALIDATED   │
    └───────┬───────┘               └───────┬───────┘
            │                               │
            ▼                               ▼
    ┌───────────────┐               ┌───────────────┐
    │  PERSEVERE    │               │    PIVOT      │
    │ Scale what    │               │ Change one    │
    │ works         │               │ fundamental   │
    └───────────────┘               │ aspect        │
                                    └───────────────┘
```

### Pivot Types

| Pivot Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Zoom-in** | Single feature becomes whole product | Flickr (from game to photo sharing) |
| **Zoom-out** | Whole product becomes single feature | Microsoft Office (suite from app) |
| **Customer Segment** | Same product, different users | Starbucks (B2B to B2C) |
| **Customer Need** | Same users, different problem | YouTube (dating to video sharing) |
| **Platform** | App to platform or vice versa | iOS App Store |
| **Business Architecture** | High margin/low volume ↔ low margin/high volume | Enterprise to consumer |
| **Value Capture** | Change monetization | Freemium to subscription |
| **Engine of Growth** | Viral ↔ paid ↔ sticky | Facebook (sticky to viral) |
| **Channel** | Change distribution | Direct to retail |
| **Technology** | Same solution, new technology | Film to digital cameras |

### Pivot Signals

Consider pivoting when:

- Metrics plateau despite iterations
- Customer interviews reveal different core need
- Retention remains low after multiple attempts
- CAC exceeds LTV by significant margin
- Team loses conviction in current direction

## Innovation Accounting

Track progress with metrics that matter:

### Three Learning Milestones

1. **Establish Baseline**: First MVP measures current reality
2. **Tune the Engine**: Iterate to improve metrics toward business model requirements
3. **Pivot or Persevere**: Decide based on rate of progress

### Cohort Analysis

Track user behavior by acquisition cohort:

```text
Cohort     | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4
-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------
Jan 2025   | 100%   | 45%    | 30%    | 22%
Feb 2025   | 100%   | 52%    | 38%    | 30%
Mar 2025   | 100%   | 60%    | 45%    | 38%
```

Improving retention across cohorts = validated learning.

## AI-Assisted Lean Startup

### Hypothesis Generation

When provided with a product concept, generate:

1. Core value hypothesis
2. Growth hypothesis
3. 5-10 leap of faith assumptions
4. Prioritized by risk × impact

### MVP Design

For each risky assumption, suggest:

1. Experiment type (interview, landing page, concierge, etc.)
2. Sample size needed
3. Success/failure criteria
4. Timeline estimate

### Experiment Analysis

Given experiment results, provide:

1. Statistical significance assessment
2. Hypothesis validation status
3. Recommended next steps
4. Pivot considerations if relevant
