Use this skill to design and implement bold, production-ready frontends when the request involves UI. Combine it with repository UI/UX requirements (`docs/ui/requirements.md`) and existing design systems.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, lock in a clear, memorable direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does the interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Commit to a strong aesthetic (e.g., brutalist/raw, retro-futuristic, editorial/magazine, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, industrial/utilitarian). Choose one and execute it precisely.
- **Constraints**: Framework, performance, accessibility, build tooling.
- **Differentiation**: What makes this unforgettable? Aim for a single standout idea.

Then build working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, templ, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking with a cohesive point of view
- Meticulous in spacing, motion, and detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: Pick characterful, non-default fonts; pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font. Avoid Arial/Inter/Roboto/system defaults.
- **Color & Theme**: Define a strong palette with CSS variables; prefer decisive dominance + accents over timid mixes.
- **Motion**: Use meaningful animations (page load, staggered reveals, purposeful hover states). Prefer CSS; keep motion aligned to the chosen aesthetic.
- **Spatial Composition**: Consider asymmetry, overlap, generous negative space or intentional density. Avoid cookie-cutter layouts.
- **Background & Details**: Build atmosphere with gradients, meshes, textures, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, or grain overlays—matching the aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-looking designs (purple-on-white defaults, predictable layouts, overused fonts, interchangeable components). Each UI should feel intentionally crafted for its context. Match implementation effort to the chosen style: maximalism demands rich effects; minimalism demands precise restraint.
