# What this covers
- MI/transfer entropy features, causal validation, Bayesian conditioning.

# Navigation (load on demand)
- docs/knowledge-base/domains/foundations/advanced-mathematics/information-theory.md
- docs/knowledge-base/domains/foundations/advanced-mathematics/causal-inference.md
- docs/knowledge-base/domains/foundations/advanced-mathematics/conditional-probability-and-bayes-theorem.md

# Quick workflows
- Feature relevance → MI/TE from information-theory.
- Causal checks (Granger/DAGs/potential outcomes) → causal-inference.
- Bayesian updates → conditional-probability-and-bayes-theorem.

# Notes
- Keep context to the specific technique needed.
