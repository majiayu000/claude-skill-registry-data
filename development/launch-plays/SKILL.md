# Launch Playbooks Skill

## When to Use
- Planning upcoming product/feature launches.
- Auditing current launch processes for efficiency gaps.
- Onboarding new PMMs or cross-functional launch partners.

## Framework
1. **Tiering Model** – define Tier 1/2/3 criteria (impact, audience, readiness) with required workstreams.
2. **Workstreams** – campaign, content, enablement, comms, success, ops, product readiness.
3. **RACI** – assign responsible/approver for each deliverable.
4. **Cadence** – stand-up schedule, checkpoints, risk reviews.
5. **Measurement** – KPI stack + reporting templates.

## Templates
- Launch plan board (Notion/Jira/Asana) with tasks + owners.
- Brief template capturing audience, goals, narrative, dependencies.
- Retro template for capturing learnings.

## Tips
- Lock tier and scope early to prevent scope creep.
- Maintain a risk log with mitigation owners.
- Pair with `workflow-testing` and automation teams to confirm infra readiness.
