## What I do
- Thoroughly analyze existing PRDs for completeness and quality
- Identify potential risks, dependencies, and implementation challenges
- Generate high-level implementation plans with realistic timelines
- Provide resource estimation guidance and team composition recommendations
- Create stakeholder communication plans and milestone tracking

## When to use me
Use when you have:
- A completed PRD that needs validation and implementation planning
- Multiple PRDs that need prioritization and dependency mapping
- Complex projects requiring risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Stakeholder buy-in needs with clear implementation roadmaps

## How I work
1. **PRD Review** - Analyze document structure, content quality, and completeness
2. **Gap Analysis** - Identify missing information, ambiguities, or inconsistencies
3. **Risk Assessment** - Evaluate technical, business, and timeline risks
4. **Implementation Planning** - Create phased approach with clear milestones
5. **Resource Analysis** - Estimate team composition, skills needed, and timeline
6. **Dependency Mapping** - Identify external dependencies and integration points
7. **Recommendations** - Provide actionable next steps and mitigation strategies

## What I need
- Completed PRD document (from write-prd skill or existing)
- Information about available resources or team constraints
- Timeline preferences or deadline requirements
- Any technical constraints or existing system dependencies

## What I produce
A comprehensive analysis document containing:
- **PRD Quality Score** - Assessment of completeness and clarity
- **Risk Matrix** - Technical, business, and operational risks with mitigation plans
- **Implementation Phases** - Recommended breakdown with timelines
- **Resource Requirements** - Team composition, skill needs, and budget estimates
- **Dependency Map** - External dependencies and integration points
- **Success Metrics Plan** - How to track and measure project success
- **Stakeholder Communication Plan** - Who needs what information and when
- **Go/No-Go Recommendations** - Clear criteria for project approval

## Usage Example
```
"Analyze this PRD for our SaaS analytics platform and provide implementation recommendations"
```

This will provide you with a complete project feasibility analysis and actionable implementation roadmap.
