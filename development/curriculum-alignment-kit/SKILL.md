# Curriculum Alignment Kit Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing proposals for schools, districts, or employers that require standards mapping.
- Auditing existing courseware for compliance or accreditation reviews.
- Equipping partner managers and instructional design teams with alignment templates.

## Framework
1. **Standards Inventory** – list relevant standards (Common Core, NGSS, ISTE, state-specific, employer competency models).
2. **Module Mapping** – tie program modules/outcomes to standards with evidence artifacts.
3. **Assessment Alignment** – connect assignments, labs, or projects to assessment rubrics.
4. **Compliance & Accessibility** – document requirements (FERPA, ADA, WCAG, data privacy).
5. **Review & Sign-off** – assign reviewers, track feedback, and finalize shared source of truth.

## Templates
- Alignment matrix spreadsheet (module → standard → evidence → owner).
- Reviewer checklist with accreditation/compliance prompts.
- Pilot plan outline capturing scope, evaluation metrics, and next steps.

## Tips
- Include both required and stretch standards to highlight differentiation.
- Attach evidence artifacts (lesson plans, videos, assessments) for faster review cycles.
- Pair with `design-curriculum-partnership` to auto-populate partner proposals.
