# Post-Exploration Clarification

Ask targeted questions based on what exploration revealed.
**Prerequisite:** Exploration phase complete, key files read.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
## The Iron Law of Clarification

**ASK BEFORE DESIGNING. This is not negotiable.**

After exploration, you now know:
- What exists in the codebase
- What patterns are used
- What integrations are needed

Use this knowledge to ask **informed questions** about:
- Edge cases the code will need to handle
- Integration points with existing systems
- Behavior in ambiguous scenarios

**If you catch yourself about to design without resolving ambiguities, STOP.**
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## What Clarify Does

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Ask questions based on exploration | Ask vague/generic questions |
| Reference specific code patterns found | Repeat questions from brainstorm |
| Clarify integration points | Propose approaches (that's design) |
| Resolve edge cases | Make assumptions |
| Update SPEC.md with answers | Skip to implementation |

**Clarify answers: WHAT EXACTLY should happen in specific scenarios**
**Design answers: HOW to build it** (next phase)

## Process

### 1. Review Exploration Findings

Before asking questions, review:
- Key files you read
- Patterns discovered
- Architecture insights
- Integration points identified

### 2. Identify Ambiguities

Common areas needing clarification after exploration:

**Integration Points:**
- "The existing auth system uses JWT. Should the new feature use the same token or create a new session type?"

**Edge Cases:**
- "What happens if [condition discovered in code]?"

**Scope Boundaries:**
- "The existing feature handles X. Should the new feature also handle X or is that out of scope?"

**Behavior Choices:**
- "I found two patterns in the codebase for this. Pattern A in `file.ts:23` and Pattern B in `other.ts:45`. Which should we follow?"

### 3. Ask Questions with AskUserQuestion

Present questions with context from exploration:

```
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
  "question": "The auth middleware at src/middleware/auth.ts:78 validates tokens synchronously. The new endpoint needs user data. Should we: validate synchronously (faster, simpler) or fetch fresh user data (slower, always current)?",
  "header": "Auth pattern",
  "options": [
    {"label": "Sync validation (Recommended)", "description": "Faster, uses cached token claims, matches existing patterns"},
    {"label": "Fresh fetch", "description": "Slower, always current, needed if user data changes frequently"}
  ],
  "multiSelect": false
}])
```

**Key principles:**
- Reference specific files/lines from exploration
- Lead with recommendation based on codebase patterns
- Explain trade-offs clearly
- One question at a time for complex topics

### 4. Update SPEC.md

After each answer, update `.claude/SPEC.md`:
- Add clarified requirements
- Document decisions made
- Note trade-offs accepted

```markdown
## Clarified Requirements

### Auth Pattern
- Decision: Sync validation
- Rationale: Matches existing patterns, user data changes infrequently
- Reference: src/middleware/auth.ts:78

### Edge Case: Expired Token
- Decision: Return 401, let client refresh
- Rationale: Consistent with other endpoints
```

## Question Categories

### Must Ask (based on exploration)
- Integration points with existing systems
- Patterns to follow (when multiple exist)
- Edge cases revealed by code reading

### Optional (if unclear)
- Performance requirements
- Error handling preferences
- Backward compatibility needs

### Don't Ask (already decided)
- What the feature does (that's brainstorm)
- Whether to build it (user already decided)
- Architecture approach (that's design)

## Red Flags - STOP If You're About To:

| Action | Why It's Wrong | Do Instead |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Ask without exploration context | Questions will be generic | Reference specific code findings |
| Propose architecture | Too early, still clarifying | Ask questions, save design for next phase |
| Make assumptions | Leads to rework | Ask and get explicit answer |
| Skip to design | Ambiguities cause bugs | Resolve all questions first |

## Output

Clarification complete when:
- All integration points clarified
- Edge cases resolved
- Pattern choices made
- `.claude/SPEC.md` updated with final requirements
- No remaining ambiguities

## Phase Complete

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** After completing clarification, IMMEDIATELY invoke:
```
Skill(skill="workflows:dev-design")
```
