# Lead Magnets for Therapy Practice

Build your email list with educational resources that provide real value—without CRPO violations.

---

## The Problem with Traditional Lead Magnets for Therapy

**Typical lead magnet playbook:**
- "Take this quiz to discover your anxiety type!"
- "Rate your depression on our 10-question assessment"
- "Find out if you need therapy (self-test)"

**Why these are CRPO violations:**
- Psychological assessments require professional training
- Could be mistaken for diagnosis
- Creates liability
- Undermines professional standards

**What we can do instead:**
- Educational guides
- Decision frameworks (not assessments)
- Skill-building worksheets
- Resource libraries

---

## CRPO Compliance for Lead Magnets

### Mandatory Rules

**✅ ALLOWED:**
- Educational PDF guides
- Frameworks for decision-making
- Skill-building worksheets (ACT exercises, grounding techniques)
- Resource lists
- Email mini-courses
- Video explainers

**❌ PROHIBITED:**
- Diagnostic assessments ("Rate your depression 1-10")
- Psychological quizzes ("What's your anxiety type?")
- Symptom checkers ("Do you have clinical anxiety?")
- Self-scoring tests that suggest diagnosis
- Any tool that could be misconstrued as professional assessment

**Safe Harbor Test:**
"Could a reasonable person mistake this for a professional clinical assessment?"
- If YES: Don't create it
- If NO: Probably safe (but verify)

---

## Lead Magnet Types for Therapy

### Type 1: Decision Framework (Not Assessment)

**Concept:** Help them decide if therapy is right for them (without diagnosing)

**Example: "Is Therapy Right for You? A Decision Framework"**

**Format:** PDF guide (5-7 pages)

**Content Structure:**
```
Page 1: What This Guide Is (And Isn't)

- This IS a framework to think through your decision

Page 2: Signs Therapy Might Be Helpful
- Struggles lasting more than a few weeks
- Impacting daily functioning (work, relationships, sleep)
- Coping strategies not working anymore
- Feeling stuck or overwhelmed

Page 3: What Therapy Can (and Can't) Do
- CAN: Provide tools, support, understanding
- CAN'T: Fix everything immediately, replace medication when needed

Page 4: Questions to Ask Yourself
- Am I ready to talk about difficult things?
- Do I have time/resources for therapy?
- Am I looking for someone to tell me what to do, or help me figure it out?

Page 5: What to Look for in a Therapist
- Credentials (CRPO registered)
- Approach (CBT, ACT, psychodynamic, etc.)
- Logistics (virtual, in-person, availability)
- Fit (do they get you?)

Page 6: Next Steps
- If you're ready: Book a consultation
- If you're not sure: That's okay too
- Crisis resources if needed
```

## Measuring Success

### Track These Metrics

**Conversion metrics:**
- Landing page visits → opt-ins (aim for 20-40%)
- Opt-ins → email opens (aim for 50-70% for Email 1)
- Opt-ins → booked consultations (aim for 5-15% within 30 days)

**Engagement metrics:**
- PDF downloads (if hosted)
- Time on landing page
- Email reply rate

**What to test:**
- Headline variations
- Different lead magnet topics
- PDF vs. email course format
- Landing page copy

---

## Common Questions

### "How do I promote this without being salesy?"

**Answer:** Offer it as a genuine resource.
- "Wrote a guide on managing anxiety - thought you might find it helpful"
- "If you're struggling with [X], this might help"

Don't: "Download my FREE guide NOW before it's GONE!"

### "Should I gate it behind an email form?"

**Pros of gating:**
- Build email list
- Can follow up
- Track who's interested

**Cons of gating:**
- Lower distribution
- Feels transactional
- Some people won't opt in

**Recommendation:** Gate it. But make the value clear.

### "Can I share client stories in lead magnets?"

**No.** CRPO prohibits testimonials. Don't include:
- "Client X reduced their anxiety by 80%"
- Before/after stories
- Success rates

You CAN include:
- Your own experience (if comfortable)
- General patterns you notice (anonymized)
- Research findings (cited properly)

2. **Could a reasonable person mistake this for clinical assessment?** (If yes, revise)
3. **Would CRPO approve of this?** (If unsure, err on side of caution)
4. **Does it sound like me?** (Use your voice, not generic)
5. **Is it genuinely helpful?** (Would I share this with a friend?)

If all answers align, you're ready to launch.
