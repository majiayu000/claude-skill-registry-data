# Renewal Escalation Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Managing red/yellow accounts approaching renewal with unresolved blockers.
- Coordinating cross-functional support (product, finance, legal, exec) on high-stakes negotiations.
- Documenting escalation paths to ensure clarity on ownership and timelines.

## Framework
1. **Tier Definitions** – outline criteria for green/yellow/red escalations and required response times.
2. **Stakeholder Matrix** – assign owners (CSM, AE, exec sponsor, product, finance, legal) per tier.
3. **Communication Protocols** – define templates, meeting cadences, and status update requirements.
4. **Decision Authority** – specify who can approve concessions, roadmap commitments, or contract terms.
5. **Post-Escalation Review** – capture learnings, update playbooks, and track commitments.

## Templates
- Escalation intake form (issue, impact, requested support, deadline).
- Executive briefing doc with talking points, risks, and desired outcomes.
- Resolution tracker to log actions, owners, and next check-ins.

## Tips
- Pair with `renewal-playbooks` to ensure escalations tie back to structured plays.
- Keep approval matrices accessible so field teams know who to engage.
- Review escalations monthly to ensure commitments are fulfilled.
