# Dash Discover (Meta-Skill)

The Meta-Skill Discovery Engine evaluates a Dart or Flutter project's
architecture, language idioms, testing patterns, and documentation health to
uncover latent modernization opportunities that standard static analysis passes
ignore.

---

## 1. When to use this skill

Use this skill when:

- Asked questions like: _"Am I doing this right?"_, _"Am I holding it right?"_,
  or _"What skills should I use on this repository?"_
- Entering a new or unfamiliar Dart/Flutter repository and determining where to
  focus modernization effort.
- `dart analyze` reports clean code (0 errors, 0 warnings), but the codebase may
  still harbor outdated pre-Dart 3 constructs, legacy matcher assertions,
  unstructured CLI entrypoints, or rotting doc examples.

### When NOT to use (Abstention Guardrails)

Do NOT run or prescribe discovery scans when:

- **Non-Dart / Non-Flutter Projects**: The repository or directory has no
  `pubspec.yaml` or Dart source files (e.g. pure documentation repositories or
  external language services).
- **Targeted Single-File Edits or Bug Fixes**: The user is requesting a narrow,
  isolated bug fix or single-file adjustment. Do not derail the turn into a
  broad repository-wide architectural audit unless specifically solicited.
- **Active In-Flight Breaking Migrations**: The repository is midway through a
  breaking SDK upgrade or uncommitted refactoring. Allow primary migrations to
  stabilize before running discovery sweeps.

---

## 2. Core Mental Model: The Analyzer Blindspot

Static analysis (`dart analyze`) verifies syntactic and semantic correctness,
not architectural quality or modern idiomatic design. A package can pass
`dart analyze --fatal-infos` with zero warnings while simultaneously:

- Using 7-branch polymorphic `else if (x is Y)` cascades instead of concise Dart
  3 switch expressions with pattern destructuring.
- Relying on legacy `package:test` `expect(actual, matcher)` calls instead of
  fluent, type-safe `package:checks`.
- Storing rotting, unverified code snippets in `/// ``` ` doc comments instead
  of automated `{@example}` region testing.
- Building ad-hoc monolithic 300+ line `bin/main.dart` entrypoints without
  `package:args/command_runner.dart`.

Dash Discover systematically identifies these latent gaps and points directly to
the specialized skills equipped to remediate them.

## 3. Two-Tier Discovery Protocol

### Tier 1: Fast Static Heuristics (<50ms)

Run the discovery CLI from anywhere in the workspace:

```bash
dart run dash_discover <path-to-target-package>
```

Or for structured machine ingestion:

```bash
dart run dash_discover <path-to-target-package> --json
```

<!-- DISCOVERY_RULES_START -->

The static scanner performs rapid, zero-network checks across 7 built-in rules:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. **Testing Architecture (`dart-migrate-to-checks-package`)**: Detects test or flutter_test in dependencies when checks is absent.
2. **Dart 3 Language Idioms (`dart-use-pattern-matching`)**: Detects legacy else if (... is ...) type cascades and returning switch statements.
3. **CLI Architecture (`dart-build-cli-app`)**: Detects ad-hoc bin/*.dart CLI entrypoints lacking structured argument parsing.
4. **Cross-Platform Robustness (`dart-use-path-package`)**: Detects manual path string concatenation without package:path.
5. **Testing Architecture (`dart-generate-test-mocks`)**: Detects handwritten fake or mock class definitions without mockito or mocktail.
6. **Testing Architecture (`dart-matcher-best-practices`)**: Detects unidiomatic expect() assertions (e.g. expect(x.length, ...) or expect(x.isEmpty, true)).
7. **Dart 3 Language Idioms (`dart-seal-type-hierarchies`)**: Detects closed type hierarchies that are not sealed, so the compiler cannot check switch exhaustiveness over them.

<!-- DISCOVERY_RULES_END -->

### Tier 2: Token-Efficient Outline Probing

To capture complex cross-cutting architectural patterns beyond regexes:

1. Generate the condensed repository outline (~1k tokens):
   ```bash
   dart run dash_discover <path-to-target-package> --outline-only
   ```
2. The outline captures:
   - `pubspec.yaml` (dependencies, dev-dependencies, SDK constraints).
   - Shallow directory structure (up to 3 levels deep).
   - Structural API signatures and class outlines (via
     `sem entities lib/ --signatures`).
3. Pass the generated prompt (`--prompt-only`) and outline to a fast model (such
   as Gemini Flash) along with the active skills catalog to evaluate semantic
   architectural fit with concrete file evidence.

## 4. Remediation Workflow

When `dash-discover` produces recommendations:

1. **Triage by Lifecycle & Confidence**:
   - Focus on finite migrations first (e.g. core language modernization and
     testing migrations), prioritized by confidence and affected file count.
   - Treat periodic hygiene audits (e.g. cognitive complexity, doc validation)
     as recurring sweeps rather than one-time migrations.
   - Throttle ubiquitous recommendations (e.g. at most one test framework
     migration at a time).
2. **Follow the Resolved Skill Target**:
   - Each opportunity output by `dash-discover` includes a `resolved_uri` in
     `--json` and a clickable link in Markdown.
   - If the target skill is installed locally (`is_local: true`), inspect and
     follow the local `SKILL.md` directly (`file://...`).
   - If not installed locally, inspect the upstream definition at the provided
     `github_url` or install the skill into your agent environment before
     applying changes.
3. **Verify Empirically**:
   - Ensure tests continue to pass (`dart test`).
   - Ensure analysis remains clean (`dart analyze`).
