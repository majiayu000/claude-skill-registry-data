name: Nodes Declarative Patterns
description: Build n8n nodes using declarative style with JSON-based routing configuration for REST API integrations. Use this skill when implementing standard CRUD operations, configuring requestDefaults, defining routing in operation options, setting up declarative pagination, adding query parameters via routing.send, or processing responses with postReceive. Apply when building REST API nodes with simple request/response patterns and automatic pagination handling.
---

## When to use this skill:

- When building REST API integrations with standard CRUD operations
- When configuring requestDefaults (baseURL, headers)
- When defining routing configuration in operation options
- When using routing.request for HTTP method and URL
- When implementing routing.send for body or query parameters
- When setting up declarative pagination (offset-based)
- When using displayOptions to show/hide fields based on resource/operation
- When processing responses with output.postReceive
- When extracting data from nested response properties (rootProperty)
- When adding filters as collection type properties with routing
- When deciding whether to use declarative vs programmatic style
- When working with *.node.ts files that use routing patterns
