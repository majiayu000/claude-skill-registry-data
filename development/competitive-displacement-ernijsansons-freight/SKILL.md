Worth comparing? 15-minute call.

## Vulnerability Detection Methods

### LinkedIn Social Listening

**Search Operators**:
- "[Competitor Name] problems"
- "[Competitor Name] issues"
- "[Competitor Name] delays"
- "Leaving [Competitor Name]"

**What to Look For**:
- Customer complaints in posts/comments
- Service failure mentions
- Job postings for "replace current 3PL"

### Glassdoor Intelligence Mining

**Search Strategy**: Check competitor Glassdoor reviews

**Look For**:
- "Lost major customer" mentions in employee reviews
- "Service quality declining" themes
- "High turnover in account management"

**Why It Works**: Employees reveal customer losses before they're public

---

### Job Posting Analysis
