  source-notes:
    danicat-skills-deleted: |
      Originally also sourced from danicat/skills#go-best-practices and
      danicat/skills#go-project-setup; both skills were deleted upstream on
      2026-07-21 (commit 201fa420, "skill optimisation and repo cleanup"). Their
      distilled content is now owned and maintained by go-ultimate — the
      project-setup boilerplates live under assets/ (verified to build with
      Go 1.27.x) and the best-practices material is folded into
      references/engineering-policy.md and references/code-review.md.
    jetbrains-restructured: |
      JetBrains/go-modern-guidelines restructured on 2026-08-11: the skill moved
      path and was rewritten from a static per-version markdown catalog into a
      thin wrapper around a Modern Go Guidelines CLI. The catalog did not
      disappear, it changed format — it is now structured data at
      internal/guidelines/guidelines.json (Apache-2.0), so it stays diffable but
      is no longer readable as prose. references/modern-go.md owns its own
      catalog and is checked against that file by since_version when a new Go
      release lands; entries are adopted only after verifying them against a
      real toolchain. The CLI approach is deliberately not adopted — it would
      add a runtime dependency on a third-party binary to an otherwise
      self-contained skill.
    cloudwego-eino-adk-0.1: |
      `adk-0.1` is an in-repo ADK package, not a versioned tag; treated as a
      point-in-time reference, not a recoverable pin.
    metalagman-unlicensed: |
      metalagman/agent-skills ships no LICENSE file, so its text is
      all-rights-reserved by default. Nothing is copied from it verbatim: the
      rules were extracted and rewritten in this skill's own voice, and the
      donor is credited in the affected references. Its bulk style-guide
      documents are derivatives of Google styleguide (CC-BY-3.0) and uber-go/
      guide (Apache-2.0), which this skill sources directly from upstream
      instead.

# Go Ultimate Skill

A single, opinionated skill for writing the best Go programs — synthesized from
four general-Go skills, four agent/MCP donors (one donor, eino, contributes two
documents), the Google and Uber style guides, and a repository/production-practice
donor. Opinions represent the synthesized consensus; where the donors disagreed,
this skill resolved the conflict per the precedence ladder below.

## When this skill applies

**Always**, for any Go work: code generation, refactoring, code review,
architecture and style discussions, scaffolding, or any change to `.go` files.

It overrides generic Go style/lint guidance when they conflict.

## Setup — resolving `<skill-dir>`

Several instructions in this skill reference `<skill-dir>` — the absolute path to
this installed skill directory. Resolve it once per session.

**Primary rule:** `<skill-dir>` is the directory containing this `SKILL.md`.
That always works, regardless of how the skill was installed. The bundled
detector is at `<skill-dir>/scripts/goversion/main.go`; the templates are at
`<skill-dir>/assets/`.

This skill ships a manifest for each supported harness (see the repo root), so it
can be installed as a plugin on all of them. Each harness resolves the plugin
root differently; use the row matching yours:

| Harness | `<skill-dir>` resolution |
|---|---|
| Claude Code (plugin) | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/go-ultimate` — the harness resolves this at runtime; the path includes a version directory, so do not hardcode it. |
| Codex (plugin) | `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/go-ultimate` — Codex exposes the plugin root via `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` in hook/script contexts. |
| Cursor (plugin) | the plugin's `skills/go-ultimate/` directory; Cursor installs plugins into its cache. Confirm the absolute path via Cursor's plugin UI. |
| Grok Build (plugin) | the plugin's `skills/go-ultimate/` directory; Grok reads Claude-compatible plugin content. |
| GitHub Copilot CLI (plugin) | the plugin's `skills/go-ultimate/` directory. |
| ZCode | `~/.zcode/skills/go-ultimate` (or the workspace `.zcode/skills/`); ZCode also recognizes the `.claude-plugin/` manifest. |
| OpenCode | the directory you copied `skills/go-ultimate/` into (manual install — see README). |
| Any harness (manual clone) | the cloned `skills/go-ultimate/` directory. |

> **The `<skill-dir>` path matters for this skill.** Unlike markdown-only skills,
> go-ultimate executes its bundled detector (`scripts/goversion/main.go`) and
> references its `assets/` templates by path. If your harness does not expose the
> plugin root through a variable (Cursor, Grok, Copilot, OpenCode), locate the
> installed `skills/go-ultimate/` directory once and use that absolute path. As a
> fallback, the detector is a stdlib-only single file — copy `main.go` into the
> target project and run it there if path resolution fails.

## How to use this skill

1. **Detect the project's Go version** by running the bundled detector
   `go run <skill-dir>/scripts/goversion/main.go <project-path>` (it prints the
   bare version, e.g. `1.24.3`, and always exits 0 — falling back to the Go
   runtime version if no `go.mod` or no `go` directive is found). Use features
   up to that version. See [references/modern-go.md](references/modern-go.md).
2. **Identify the project type** using the decision tree below, then load the
   matching reference.
3. **Follow the non-negotiable principles** below — these always apply.
4. **On conflicts** between references, apply the precedence rules at the end.

---

## Project-type decision tree

Ask "what is the user building?" and route accordingly:

```
Is the code a single binary that the user runs?
├── Yes → Is it < ~300 lines with no external deps beyond stdlib?
│   ├── Yes → SCRIPT / TINY TOOL
│   │          → references/project-layouts.md § Scripts
│   │          → references/engineering-policy.md
│   └── No  → CLI APPLICATION
│              → references/project-layouts.md § CLI
│              → references/engineering-policy.md
│
Is the code meant to be imported by other modules?
├── Yes → LIBRARY / MODULE
│          → references/libraries.md
│          → references/project-layouts.md § Library
│          → references/engineering-policy.md
│
Is the code a long-running server (HTTP/gRPC/messaging)?
├── Yes → BACKEND SERVICE
│          → references/architecture.md        (mandatory)
│          → references/production-readiness.md (mandatory)
│          → references/project-layouts.md § Service
│          → references/engineering-policy.md
│
Is the code a server exposing tools/resources/prompts to LLMs over MCP?
├── Yes → MCP SERVER
│          → references/mcp-server.md          (mandatory)
│          → references/project-layouts.md § Service or § CLI (stdio server = CLI-shaped)
│          → references/production-readiness.md (if hosted/long-running, not stdio)
│          → references/engineering-policy.md
│
Is the code an LLM-driven agent that calls tools / orchestrates multi-step reasoning?
├── Yes → AI AGENT
│          → references/agents.md              (mandatory)
│          → references/project-layouts.md § CLI or § Service (depends on hosting)
│          → references/production-readiness.md (if hosted/long-running)
│          → references/engineering-policy.md
│
Is the code a code generator, linter, or analysis tool?
├── Yes → Treat as CLI APPLICATION or LIBRARY (whichever fits the distribution),
│          then see references/engineering-policy.md § Code generation
│
Otherwise → ask the user to clarify before proposing structure.
```

**Regardless of type:** when initializing a repository, adding CI, or reviewing
repository hygiene, also load
[references/repo-and-ci.md](references/repo-and-ci.md) — required files, ignore
baselines, `go tool` pinning, workflow shape, release stamping.

---

## Non-negotiable principles (always apply)

These are the consensus backbone. Every Go file this skill touches obeys them.

1. **Modern Go, version-gated.** Use every feature up to the project's `go.mod`
   version. `any` over `interface{}`. `errors.Is/As` over `==`. `slices`/`maps`/
   `cmp` over hand-rolled loops. See [references/modern-go.md](references/modern-go.md).

2. **No `pkg/` directory.** Ever. Library code lives at the module root;
   importable apps expose a public `port/` package. The `pkg/` convention is a
   kubernetes-era anti-pattern. See [references/project-layouts.md](references/project-layouts.md).

3. **`internal/` for private code; `cmd/<name>/` for multiple binaries; flat for
   tiny tools.** Start simple; grow deliberately.

4. **Context first, errors explicit.** `func F(ctx context.Context, ...) (..., error)`.
   Wrap with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`. Never compare errors with `==`.

5. **Thin adapters, fat-free imports.** Business-logic packages never import
   `net/http`, `os`, or transport SDKs. Adapters only translate formats and
   protocol shapes.

6. **Concurrency hygiene.** Every goroutine has an exit condition (Context or
   WaitGroup). Use `errgroup` for parallel fan-out. Always test with `-race`.

7. **Accept interfaces, return structs.** Interfaces are defined at the point of
   use, not the point of implementation. Small, single-method interfaces win.

8. **Comments explain why, not what.** Named, idiomatic, exported identifiers do
   the rest.

9. **Typed contracts at boundaries.** MCP tool args and agent inter-node data
   flow are typed structs (generics where the framework supports it), never
   `map[string]any` as the universal contract. See
   [references/mcp-server.md](references/mcp-server.md) and
   [references/agents.md](references/agents.md).

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detect Go version, use features up to it | [modern-go.md](references/modern-go.md) |
| Pick layout by project type | [project-layouts.md](references/project-layouts.md) |
| Service architecture: bounded-context hexagonal | [architecture.md](references/architecture.md) |

| Naming: `MixedCaps`, initialism case (`userID`, `HTTPClient`), no `Get` prefix, no `util`/`common` package | [engineering-policy.md](references/engineering-policy.md) |
| `%w` only when the cause is intended as API; `%v` for a dependency's error crossing a public boundary | [engineering-policy.md](references/engineering-policy.md) |
| No mutable globals; no goroutines or I/O in `init()`; comma-ok on every type assertion | [engineering-policy.md](references/engineering-policy.md) |
| Fan-out is bounded (`SetLimit`/semaphore); channels unbuffered or size 1 | [engineering-policy.md](references/engineering-policy.md) |
| Repo must have `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, ignore files, `.golangci.yml`, CI; tools pinned via `go tool` | [repo-and-ci.md](references/repo-and-ci.md) |
| Services: bounded calls, safe retries, stable error contract, liveness≠readiness, outbox, rolling-safe migrations | [production-readiness.md](references/production-readiness.md) |
| MCP server: official `go-sdk`, typed tool handlers, two-channel errors, tool design as outcomes-not-operations | [mcp-server.md](references/mcp-server.md) |

## Conflict precedence (which reference wins)

When two references seem to disagree:

1. **Layout / architecture / ports / wiring / modular monolith** for services →
   [architecture.md](references/architecture.md) wins.
2. **Version-gated syntax** (whether a feature exists in this Go version) →
   [modern-go.md](references/modern-go.md) wins.
3. **Everything else** (config, errors, testing, naming, linting, dependencies,
   CI) → [engineering-policy.md](references/engineering-policy.md) wins.
4. **Library public-API concerns** (semver, deprecation, doc.go split) →
   [libraries.md](references/libraries.md) wins for library projects.
5. **Code review output format** → [code-review.md](references/code-review.md) wins.
6. **MCP servers in Go** (SDK choice, tool-handler design, two-channel errors,
   pagination, middleware) → [mcp-server.md](references/mcp-server.md) wins.
7. **AI agents in Go** (ReAct loop, multi-agent topology, typed data flow
   between nodes, state externalism) → [agents.md](references/agents.md) wins.
8. **Runtime behavior of a long-running service** (timeout/retry/idempotency
   policy, API error contract, liveness vs readiness, metric cardinality,
   migration safety, outbox) →
   [production-readiness.md](references/production-readiness.md) wins. It
   refines rule 3: engineering-policy sets the observability *floor*, this sets
   the service shape.
9. **Concrete repository and pipeline files** (required files, ignore baselines,
   workflow YAML, `go tool` pinning, build stamping) →
   [repo-and-ci.md](references/repo-and-ci.md) wins. It also refines rule 3:
   engineering-policy states which gates are mandatory, this states how they are
   written.

The adapter carve-out ([mcp-server.md](references/mcp-server.md) § "Adapter
carve-out") refines rule 5 of the non-negotiable principles for MCP handlers
only: the handler package is an inbound adapter and may import `mcp.*`.

## Project-file precedence (escalation rule)

When a project-level instruction file contradicts this skill, **follow this
order**, stopping at the first match:

1. **Explicit user instruction in the current turn** — always wins. If the user
   says "use Functional Options here," use them, even though the skill mandates
   Resolvable Config Struct.
2. **Project `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root** — wins over this skill
   for project-specific conventions. A project that legitimately needs `pkg/`
   (e.g. a kubernetes-style repo) says so there.
3. **This skill** — the default for any Go decision not addressed above.
4. **Generic Go style/lint guidance** — lowest priority; this skill overrides it
   on conflicts by design.

If (1) and (2) are silent and the skill's rule feels wrong for the project,
**say so out loud before applying it** — propose the deviation, name the rule it
contradicts, and let the user decide. Do not silently override the skill, and do
not silently apply it when a project file arguably contradicts it.

## Verification

After applying this skill to a Go project, the project should pass:

```
go vet ./...
go build ./...
go test -race ./...
```

If any of these fail as a result of changes made under this skill, that is a
skill regression — surface it, do not paper over it. For new projects scaffolded
from `assets/`, the result should compile and test green before handing control
back to the user.

## Evaluating the skill itself

Example prompts and expected behaviors for catching drift live in
[`evals/`](evals/README.md). Run them when the skill is updated. The audit
methodology that produced this skill is not shipped with it; the rules above are
the canonical source.

This skill is **highly opinionated**. Do not relitigate these rules at runtime —
apply them, and note any project-specific deviation in the project's own
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` if one exists.
