## Theories of Beauty

### Objectivism vs. Subjectivism

**Objectivism**: Beauty is in the object
- Certain properties (proportion, harmony) constitute beauty
- Beauty is discoverable, not created

**Subjectivism**: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
- "Beautiful" reports a response, not a property
- De gustibus non est disputandum

### Kant's Theory

```
KANTIAN AESTHETICS
══════════════════

AESTHETIC JUDGMENT
├── Disinterested: No desire for object's existence
├── Universal: Claims validity for all
├── Purposiveness without purpose
└── Necessary: Demands agreement

BEAUTIFUL vs. SUBLIME
├── Beautiful: Form, bounded, harmony
│   └── Pleasant contemplation
└── Sublime: Formless, overwhelming, infinite
    └── Initial displeasure → pleasure in reason's power

FREE BEAUTY vs. DEPENDENT BEAUTY
├── Free: Pure aesthetic (flower, music)
└── Dependent: Judged against concept (beautiful horse)
```

- Art transmits feelings from artist to audience
- Problems: What counts as "expressing"?

**Formalism**: Art is significant form

**Institutional Theory**: Art is what the art world accepts
- Dickie: Artefact conferred status by art world
- Problems: Circular? Who decides?

**Historical Definition**: Art relates to previous art
- Levinson: Art intended for regard as prior art was
- Explains expanding category

### Ontology of Art

**What kind of thing is a work of art?**

| Type | Artwork Example | Ontology |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Singular | Painting | Physical object |
| Multiple | Novel | Type (tokens are copies) |
| Performance | Symphony | Type (performances are instances) |
