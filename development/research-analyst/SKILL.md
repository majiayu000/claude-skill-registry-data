## Example Research Deliverable

**Question**: "What are the best practices for building high-performing design teams?"

**Executive Summary**:
Top-performing design teams share three key characteristics: (1) clear design systems and processes, (2) regular collaboration rituals (design reviews, critiques), and (3) balanced skills across UX research, UI design, and prototyping. Research shows teams with dedicated design ops roles are 40% more productive. Recommendation: Start with design system establishment and weekly design reviews.

**Key Findings**:
1. **Team Composition**: 2-3 UX designers per 5-7 engineers is optimal ratio
2. **Processes**: Weekly design critiques improve quality 35%
3. **Tools**: Figma adoption correlates with 50% faster iteration
4. **Culture**: Psychological safety is #1 predictor of team success
