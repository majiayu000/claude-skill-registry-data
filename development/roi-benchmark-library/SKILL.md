# ROI Benchmark Library Skill

## When to Use
- Comparing current performance vs historical or industry benchmarks.
- Setting guardrails for budgeting, pacing, and campaign approvals.
- Equipping finance/marketing leaders with realistic ROI expectations.

## Framework
1. **Benchmark Sources** – internal history, partner data, analyst reports, industry surveys.
2. **Segmentation** – channel, region, persona, product, funnel stage.
3. **Metric Definitions** – CAC, CPL, ROAS, payback, pipeline-to-spend, revenue-to-spend.
4. **Update Cadence** – monthly for active channels, quarterly for strategic benchmarks.
5. **Usage Guidance** – when to escalate variances, how to contextualize outliers.

## Templates
- Benchmark matrix (channel x metric x segment).
- Variance alert sheet with thresholds + recommended actions.
- Executive summary page for QBRs.

## Tips
- Normalize for currency changes and attribution windows before comparing.
- Pair with `monitor-channel-pacing` to trigger alerts against guardrails.
- Share benchmark deltas with channel owners to inform creative/test roadmaps.
