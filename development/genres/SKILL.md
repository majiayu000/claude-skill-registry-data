### KYC - Verification Limitations

| Area | Known Gaps | Friction |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Identity Docs** | Cannot verify authenticity via OSINT; forgeries exist | N/A |
| **Address** | Electoral rolls incomplete; privacy protections increasing | `(pub)` to `(restr)` |
| **Source of Funds** | Requires documentation from subject; cannot verify via public sources | `(opaque)` |
| **Business Purpose** | Stated purpose cannot be verified without investigation | N/A |
| **Ongoing Monitoring** | Requires continuous screening; point-in-time reports insufficient | `(paid)` |

### KYC requires direct documentation from subject; OSINT provides corroboration only.
