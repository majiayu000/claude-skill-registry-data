# Executive KPI Briefings Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing weekly/monthly ELT updates with BI insights.
- Translating dashboards into succinct decision memos.
- Coordinating follow-up actions after KPI reviews.

## Framework
1. **Headline & Signal** – lead with KPI delta, direction, and confidence.
2. **Driver Analysis** – highlight top drivers, segments, or anomalies.
3. **Implications** – spell out impact on goals, customers, or investments.
4. **Actions & Owners** – list next steps, DRIs, due dates, and guardrails.
5. **Appendix** – link to dashboard tabs, methodology, and deeper data.

## Templates
- 1-page KPI memo (headline, context, actions).
- Slide template for ELT/board readouts.
- Follow-up tracker with ownership + status fields.

## Tips
- Keep narratives under 200 words unless deeper context is requested.
- Pair with `build-exec-dashboard` and `plan-bi-roadmap` for consistent storytelling.
- Capture questions/decisions in a log to feed future prioritization.
