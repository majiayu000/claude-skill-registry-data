# Call Analysis Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Reviewing discovery/diligence calls for coaching or inspection.
- Automating scorecards for enablement or QA teams.
- Prepping executive summaries of key customer conversations.

## Framework
1. **Section Definition** – intro, discovery, value, objection handling, next steps (customizable).
2. **Scoring Rubric** – 1-5 scale with observable behaviors for each section.
3. **Signal Tags** – categorize quotes (pain, metrics, stakeholders, commitments, risks).
4. **Insight Summaries** – auto-generate “what went well” vs “improve” lists with evidence.
5. **Action Routing** – push tasks to CRM, assign coaching drills, or escalate to leadership.

## Templates
- Call analysis worksheet (scores, notes, quotes, actions).
- Highlight reel brief with timestamp, quote, takeaway.
- Manager inspection summary ready for pipeline reviews.

## Tips
- Keep rubric consistent across teams to enable benchmarking.
- Capture 2-3 verbatim quotes per section for credibility.
- Pair with `meddic-checklist` when evaluating qualification coverage.
