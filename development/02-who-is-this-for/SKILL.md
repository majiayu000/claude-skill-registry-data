# Who is this for?

> "Developers" is not a market. It's a medium. If your ICP doesn't exclude anyone, it isn't one.

**Use this when:** you describe your user as "developers" or "engineering teams," you can't name a person who is clearly *not* a fit, or you're aiming your messaging at the VP of Engineering because they have the budget.

## The core idea

A usable ICP is specific enough that some people are obviously **out**. "Every developer" gives you nothing to say, because a message that speaks to everyone speaks to no one. Sharpen until exclusion is possible.

And in almost every AI/dev-tool sale there is **more than one person**: the developer who adopts is rarely the person who pays. Market to the adopter; sell to the buyer. Confuse the two and you get great meetings and no decisions.

## Framework 1: The personas in the sale (Frankl)

Map who plays each role. You need all of them for a complex sale; skip one and the deal stalls.

| Persona | Cares about | Role in the sale |
|---|---|---|
| **Alpha Dev** | "What's possible?" Lives in the future. *No budget.* | Finds you, experiments, advocates internally, creates social proof |
| **Empowered CTO** | Kairos, weeks off a release cycle, competitive edge. *Has budget.* | Approves spend and strategic fit |
| **VP Engineering** | Team velocity, DX, quality at scale. Fears downtime/security | Evaluates feasibility, tests in staging |
| **SRE / Platform Eng** | Reliability, less toil. *Reads your code before your copy.* | Gatekeeps operational risk |

> The Alpha Dev is **not your long-term customer**. They chase the next shiny thing. You need them anyway: they carry new tech to the people who pay.

## Framework 2: Jobs to be done, not demographics (Czakon)

A job title is not actionable; a **job** is. Write it as:

> *When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].*

Example: *"When I inherit a service with no tests, I want to generate a safety net fast, so I can refactor without fear."* That sentence tells you the trigger, the pain, and the win. A demographic never does.

## Decision tree: single-player or complex sale?

```
Does the developer who adopts also control the budget?
├─ YES  → single-player / PLG motion.
│         ICP centers on the adopter. Optimize time-to-value, self-serve, transparent pricing.
└─ NO   → complex sale.
          ICP centers on the adopter FOR ADOPTION, and the buyer FOR REVENUE.
          You need a "what's in it for me" for every persona above.
```

## Sharpen it: the 5-attribute ICP

Fill every line with something a stranger couldn't guess:
1. **Company shape**: stage, size, team structure (e.g. "50-500-engineer companies with a platform team")
2. **Technical context**: stack / recent change (e.g. "just adopted Kubernetes")
3. **The trigger**: what just happened that makes this urgent now
4. **The pain, in their words**: the exact phrase they'd use (get this from `talk-to-users`)
5. **Who says no**: the segment you are deliberately *not* for

## Mistakes that look reasonable

- **TAM theater**: "there are 30M developers." True and useless. Nobody sells to 30M anyone.
- **Budget-chasing**: writing everything for the CTO/VP because they pay. They don't visit your homepage; the developer does.
- **Persona = job title**: "backend engineers." That's a hat, not a human. Use the job.
- **One persona, complex sale**: nailing the Alpha Dev and forgetting the buyer → adoption with no revenue.

## Example

❌ "For developers who want to ship faster."
✅ "For **platform engineers at 50-500-eng companies who just standardized on Kubernetes** and are drowning in hand-written YAML, the ones who'd say *'I spend a day a week on manifests I shouldn't have to touch.'* Not for solo devs on Heroku."

## Your next 30 minutes

- [ ] Write your ICP with all 5 attributes filled in, including **who says no**.
- [ ] List every persona in your sale and mark: who *finds* it, who *evaluates* it, who *pays*.
- [ ] Rewrite your one-line pitch as a **Job To Be Done** (`When… I want… so I can…`).
- [ ] If you couldn't fill attribute #4 in their real words → you owe yourself `talk-to-users` before anything else.
