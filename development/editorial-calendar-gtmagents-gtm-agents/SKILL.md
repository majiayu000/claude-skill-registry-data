# Editorial Calendar Systems Skill

## When to Use
- Planning multi-asset campaigns or pillar programs.
- Coordinating cross-functional review cycles.
- Auditing content backlog, status, and alignment to GTM themes.

## Framework
1. **Cadence** – map publish dates, lead times, and dependencies.
2. **Ownership** – assign writers, reviewers, approvers, localization partners.
3. **Workflow Stages** – draft → review → design → legal → ready → scheduled → live.
4. **Metadata** – persona, stage, CTA, channels, asset type, pillar tag.
5. **Governance** – color-coding, status thresholds, reminder automation.

## Templates
- Calendar view (by week) with status tags.
- Intake brief + approval checklist.
- Monday/Asana/Notion board schema for pipeline tracking.

## Tips
- Keep a backlog column for ideas; groom weekly.
- Automate reminders for approvals to shorten cycle time.
- Document freeze windows (holidays, launches) to avoid conflicts.
