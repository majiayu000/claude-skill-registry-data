## Common Scenarios

1. **Legitimate App Wrapper**: Adversary copies signed application (e.g., OneDrive updater) to temp folder alongside malicious DLL with same name as expected dependency.
2. **Phantom DLL Exploitation**: Malicious DLL placed in PATH location where legitimate app searches for non-existent DLL.
3. **DLL Proxy Loading**: Malicious version.dll proxies all exports to real version.dll while executing malicious code on DllMain.
4. **Software Update Hijack**: Attacker replaces DLL in update staging directory before legitimate updater loads it.
