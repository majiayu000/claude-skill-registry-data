# Morgus Skill: Code Translator v2.0

## Description

This skill translates code from one programming language to another. It supports a wide range of languages and can handle complex codebases, including syntax, libraries, and frameworks.

## Core Principles

- **Language Agnostic**: Support for all major programming languages.
- **Syntax and Semantics**: Translate not just the syntax, but also the underlying logic and semantics.
- **Library and Framework Mapping**: Map equivalent libraries and frameworks between languages.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Analyze the Source Code**: Morgus parses the source code to understand its structure, dependencies, and logic.
2.  **Identify Language and Frameworks**: Morgus detects the source language and any frameworks used.
3.  **Translate the Code**: Morgus translates the code to the target language, mapping syntax, libraries, and frameworks.
4.  **Generate the Translated Code**: Morgus provides the translated code with comments and explanations.
