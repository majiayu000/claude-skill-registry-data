# Referral Fraud Detection Skill

## When to Use
- Designing safeguards for new referral initiatives.
- Investigating suspicious referral spikes, duplicate accounts, or payout anomalies.
- Reporting on program integrity for finance, legal, or compliance teams.

## Framework
1. **Signal Collection** – IP/device matching, velocity checks, blacklist databases, manual reviews.
2. **Scoring Model** – assign risk scores by cohort (new accounts, high-volume referrers, geo mismatch).
3. **Workflow Automation** – auto-flag, queue for review, or pause rewards until verified.
4. **Investigation Runbook** – define evidence gathering, communication templates, and resolution paths.
5. **Feedback Loop** – update heuristics, adjust incentives, and communicate policy changes.

## Templates
- Fraud monitoring dashboard outline (metrics, thresholds, owners).
- Investigation log (case ID, referrer, signals, action taken, notes).
- Policy update checklist (legal, comms, ops, partner notifications).

## Tips
- Combine automated checks with random manual audits for accuracy.
- Align with legal/finance on clawback procedures before launch.
- Share learnings with `incentive-design` to discourage risky behavior.
