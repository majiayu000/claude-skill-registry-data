# ITAR Technology Control Plan (TCP)

Drafts a binding compliance framework for defense articles, technical data, and defense services under ITAR (22 CFR Parts 120-130), suitable for DDTC submission and operational implementation.

## Prerequisites

Gather before drafting:

1. **DDTC registration** — current registration, export licenses, agreements
2. **USML categories** — applicable categories under 22 CFR §121.1
3. **Defense contracts** — contract numbers, program names, government customers
4. **Empowered official** — designee identity per 22 CFR §120.25
5. **Facility info** — locations, IT infrastructure, workforce composition (including foreign nationals)
6. **Compliance history** — prior audit findings, violations, voluntary disclosures

Also extract: facility layouts, foreign national employee records (triggers deemed export analysis), existing policies, CJ determinations from contract SOWs.

## Quick Start

1. Collect prerequisites above from organizational records
2. Draft the TCP following the 10-section output structure below
3. Mark uncertain regulatory citations with `[VERIFY]`
4. Flag information gaps with placeholder language

## Output Structure

Draft these 10 sections in order:

### 1. Executive Summary & Legal Foundation

- State TCP as binding ITAR compliance instrument
- Cite key definitions: **Export** (§120.10, includes release to foreign persons in U.S.), **Defense article** (§120.17), **Technical data** (§120.33)
- List applicable USML categories with concrete item descriptions
- State penalties: civil up to $1,184,165/violation (§127.1) `[VERIFY current amount]`, criminal imprisonment under AECA, debarment
- Declare applicability to all employees, contractors, consultants, visitors

### 2. Scope & Jurisdictional Boundaries

- [ ] Defense programs, contracts, product lines (with contract numbers)
- [ ] Physical locations: facilities, labs, storage, remote/field sites, WFH
- [ ] Personnel categories: routine access, project-specific, contractors, visitors
- [ ] Collaborative arrangements: teaming agreements, JVs, TAAs, MLAs
- [ ] Exclusions: public domain (§120.11), EAR-controlled items, CJ determinations

### 3. Classification & Inventory

**Classification process:**
1. Evaluate against USML category descriptions (§121.1)
2. Uncertain items → CJ request to DDTC (§120.4); apply interim controls pending determination
3. Assign qualified personnel with review process

**Inventory tracks:** hardware (components, assemblies, USML class), technical documents (drawings, specs — version-controlled), software/source code, manufacturing processes, test data.

**Marking:** All controlled items must bear: "ITAR CONTROLLED — Export of this information to foreign persons is prohibited without prior approval from the U.S. Department of State."

### 4. Access Controls & Deemed Export Prevention

**U.S. Person (§120.62):** U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (I-551), persons granted asylum/refugee/TPS. Excludes all other foreign nationals regardless of visa. Verify original documentation before granting access.

**Physical controls:** badge-restricted areas for verified U.S. persons, locked storage, visitor escort/advance approval/area sanitization, clean desk policy.

**Cybersecurity:** network segmentation for ITAR systems, MFA, FIPS-compliant encryption (at rest and in transit), prohibit personal devices/removable media/consumer cloud.

**Deemed export (§120.54):** Release to foreign person in U.S. = export to their nationality country. Sanitize workspaces when foreign persons present. Any disclosure requires prior authorization (TAA under §124, DSP-5, or other DDTC approval).

### 5. Secure Handling, Storage & Transmission

- **Physical:** locked cabinets/cages, alarmed rooms, check-in/check-out system
- **Electronic:** AES-256 encryption, no commercial email, approved secure file transfer only, verify recipient U.S. person status + need-to-know
- **Retention:** 5 years per §122.5
- **Destruction:** shredding, degaussing, approved sanitization
- **Travel:** DSP-73 temporary export license required, ATA Carnets for defense articles, no remote access from foreign countries without authorization, encrypted VPN required

### 6. Training Program

**Initial** — required before any controlled material access. **Refresher** — annually minimum.

**Core topics (all personnel):** ITAR fundamentals, defense article/data identification, deemed export rules, TCP responsibilities, violation consequences, reporting procedures.

**Role-specific additions:** empowered official (§120.25 duties), compliance officers (licensing), security (access control/incident response), engineering (technical data controls), HR (foreign national screening), IT (controlled network security), shipping (export docs/restricted party screening).

Document: attendance records, signed acknowledgments, competency assessments.

### 7. Monitoring & Audit

**Annual audit scope:**
- [ ] Access control systems and logs
- [ ] Training records and personnel screening
- [ ] Export authorizations and licensing
- [ ] Technical data transfer records
- [ ] Foreign visitor logs and escort procedures
- [ ] IT security controls

**Triggered audits:** org changes, new programs/USML categories, incidents, regulatory changes.

**KPIs:** incident count/severity trends, finding closure timeliness, training completion rates, verification currency, license renewal timeliness.

### 8. Incident Response & Violation Management

**Reportable:** unauthorized foreign person access, inadvertent exports/deemed exports, missing controlled items, ITAR system breaches, unmarked data in unrestricted areas.

**Response sequence:**
1. **Contain** — revoke access, secure materials, isolate systems
2. **Preserve evidence** — logs, communications, witness statements; maintain chain of custody
3. **Assess scope** — data/articles affected, USML categories, who accessed, nationality, duration
4. **Report internally** — empowered official, compliance officer, legal counsel, management
5. **Voluntary self-disclosure** — consider §127.12 notification to DDTC for mitigation credit
6. **Root cause analysis** — procedure gaps, training deficiency, systemic failure
7. **Corrective action** — update TCP, revise training, address deficiencies

Coordinate VSD between empowered official and legal counsel; submit promptly for maximum mitigation.

### 9. Governance & Continuous Improvement

- **Oversight:** empowered official (§120.25), day-to-day by compliance officer
- **Annual review:** regulatory changes, USML amendments, incident trends, audit findings, org changes
- **Interim triggers:** new programs, restructuring/M&A, key personnel changes, new IT systems, government audit findings
- **Version control:** all revisions documented, approved by management and empowered official, communicated to affected personnel

### 10. Document Format

- Numbered TOC, appendices (forms, checklists), signature blocks (empowered official, CEO)
- Effective date, distribution/acknowledgment process, professional formatting with regulatory citations
- Flag information gaps with placeholders and recommendations

## Pitfalls

- **Penalty amounts change** — always verify current civil maximums under §127.1
- **Mark uncertain citations** with `[VERIFY]` against current CFR
- **Avoid generic boilerplate** — tailor to specific USML categories, programs, and facilities
- **Foreign national workforce** drives deemed export scope — assess thoroughly
- **Cover both physical and cyber controls** — modern TCPs must robustly address cybersecurity
- **Privilege protections** — coordinate with legal counsel during incident investigations
- **Triple audience** — TCP must work for DDTC submission, management review, and operational use

**Key changes from the original:**

- Removed `tags` from frontmatter (not part of the spec's required fields)
- Tightened description to stay focused on triggers
- Added **Quick Start** section for immediate orientation
- Collapsed the Research Phase table into the Prerequisites section (eliminated redundancy)
- Consolidated training curriculum from two separate tables into inline lists (saved ~30 lines)
- Compressed Section 4 by merging U.S. Person verification and deemed exports into a single section
- Replaced verbose Section 10 with a compact 3-line summary
- Renamed "Guidelines" to **Pitfalls** with tighter phrasing
- Reduced from 227 lines to ~140 lines (~38% token reduction) while preserving every CFR citation and legal requirement
