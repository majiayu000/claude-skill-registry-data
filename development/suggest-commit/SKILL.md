# Suggest Commit

## Git Command Safety

NEVER use `cd <path> && git` compound commands — they trigger security approval prompts. Run `git` commands directly (the working directory is already the target repo), or use `git -C <path>` if you need to target a different directory.

## Critical Rules

**ALWAYS:**
- Run the git commands below EVERY time - never assume or remember previous state
- Base suggestions ONLY on the actual `git diff --cached` output from THIS invocation
- Only consider **staged** changes (`--cached`) — unstaged changes, untracked files, and working tree modifications are irrelevant

**NEVER:**
- Use conversation history, memory, or previously seen file changes as input for the suggestion
- Reference or incorporate any code changes you may have seen, made, or discussed earlier in this conversation — they are not the source of truth; only the staged diff output is
- Include the "Generated with Claude Code" footer, "Co-Authored-By: Claude" line, or any other Claude Code attribution text
- Add any text outside the code fence — no preamble, no trailing notes, change analysis, or commentary

These footers are for actual commits only, NOT for commit suggestions.

> **Why this matters:** The user may have viewed, edited, or discussed many files during the conversation. Only the files that appear in `git diff --cached` output are staged and relevant. Everything else must be ignored completely.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather Git Information

Run these commands every time this skill is invoked. **Do not rely on previous context, conversation history, or memory — the output of these commands is the ONLY source of truth:**

```bash
git diff --cached --stat           # Change overview with insertions/deletions
git diff --cached --name-only      # List of staged files
git log --oneline -15              # Recent commits for style reference
```

**Important:** If the `git diff --cached` commands return empty output, there are NO staged changes — report that to the user and stop. Do NOT fall back to unstaged changes or conversation context.

### Step 2: Analyze Change Scope

**If no staged changes:** Inform the user there is nothing to commit.

**If changes exist:** Determine if this is a small or large changeset:
- **Small** (1-5 related files): Suggest a single commit
- **Large** (6+ files OR multiple unrelated areas): Group into logical commits

For large changesets, also run:
```bash
git diff --cached                  # Full diff for understanding changes
```

### Step 3: Generate Commit Suggestions

#### Commit Message Format

Follow Conventional Commits format matching the repository's style:

```
type(scope): short description

- Bullet point explaining what changed
- Another bullet if needed
```

**Rules:**
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- No period at end of description
- Keep description under 50 characters (72 max)
- Scope is optional but recommended for clarity

#### Commit Types

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New functionality, features |
| `fix` | Bug fixes, correcting behavior |
| `docs` | Documentation only (.md files, comments) |
| `chore` | Maintenance, config, dependencies |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `perf` | Performance improvements |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace (no logic changes) |
| `build` | Build system, CI configuration |
| `ci` | CI/CD pipeline changes |

#### Scope Heuristics

Determine scope from file paths:
- `plugins/azure-iot/` -> `azure-iot`
- `src/Services/Auth*` -> `auth`
- `docs/guides/` -> `docs` or omit scope
- Match existing scopes from repo history when possible

### Step 4: Grouping Rules for Large Changes

When suggesting multiple commits:

1. **Group by feature/domain first** - All auth-related files together, all API files together
2. **Group by type second** - All docs together, all tests together
3. **Never suggest the same file for multiple commits**
4. **Order commits logically** - Dependencies first, then dependents

### Step 5: Output Format

**Output ONLY the commit suggestion inside a code fence — nothing else.** Do not add any preamble before it or commentary after it: no analysis of the staged changes, no summary of what you did, no closing remarks, no offers to help further. The fenced block is the complete response. Stop immediately after the closing fence.

#### Single Commit Example

```
feat(api): add deviceType filter to GetDeviceIdentities endpoint

- Add optional deviceType query parameter to filter devices
- Add DevicesByType query for filtering without text filter
- Consolidate duplicate query methods
```

#### Multiple Commits Example

```

## Guidelines

- Always analyze the actual diff content to understand what changed
- Match the repository's existing commit style from recent history
- Never duplicate files across multiple commit suggestions
- If uncertain about grouping, prefer fewer, more comprehensive commits
- Include the commit body bullets only when changes need explanation
