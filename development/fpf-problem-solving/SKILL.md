An "Operating System for Thought" — a transdisciplinary architecture for reasoning,
written in human- and machine-readable pseudo-code. FPF turns raw intelligence (human or machine)
into organisationally usable reasoning: explicit bounded contexts, auditable artefacts, multi-view
descriptions, and disciplined hand-offs between specialised actors.

## Use cases

Use FPF whenever you need to think more rigorously than the situation's default.

- Decompose a messy, cross-domain problem into parts that can be reasoned about independently
- Make a high-stakes decision with incomplete evidence — and know what evidence is still missing
- Get a mixed team to reason together without vocabulary collisions or hidden assumptions
- Audit whether a conclusion is well-founded or just plausible
- Transform or transfer an insight without losing its subject, precision, or stated limitations
- Structure a proposal that must survive scrutiny from multiple expert perspectives
- Generate alternatives systematically instead of anchoring on the first idea
- Define what "better" means before comparing options
- Classify what kind of problem you're facing before searching for solutions
- Plan how an AI agent should select and sequence its tools under budget and trust constraints
- Make a decision under uncertainty — identify options, weigh evidence, and commit with an auditable rationale
- Establish whether X causes Y — or just correlates — and determine what intervention would work
- Publish a stable multi-view artifact without changing the source semantics
- Assemble or check a public framework publication form while preserving product-specific bodies and references
- Develop a holder system's capability for a named Work family and verify transfer in representative Work
- Synthesize source ontologies for one bounded authoring decision without flattening their local meanings
- Refresh a SoTA pack, benchmark, or evidence trail when evidence decays or telemetry changes
- Synthesize architecture candidates, compare structural options, or repair modularity/reuse claims
- Detect an ontic candidate, decide its first-use disposition, and govern whether a new concept or U-kind should be introduced instead of just renamed
- Identify the exact system that acts or is intended to change, then trace a lost path from outside use to architecture, production, and recursive builders
- Discover other systems that may bear relevant consequences before a decision closes
- Explain how constituent actions perform larger work and whether a replacement preserves each receiving use
- Recover a reusable method cautiously from several performances, logs, or observations without treating the evidence as the method itself
- Make instructions usable after a change of speaker, recipient, location, time, or other reference condition
- Choose the next action during ongoing work, resume interrupted work, or make applicable methods visible when current facts, authority, and stop conditions matter
- Turn an ordinary handover, result demonstration, or successful workaround into a bounded question with a useful next move
- Coordinate whether a system or episteme is being explored, shaped, evaluated, or operated without confusing that state with claim assurance
- Preserve domain vocabulary while recovering which exact FPF value or relation a local term currently claims
- Recover the actual performer/support configuration for Work and test what survives interruption, handoff, delay, or reconfiguration
- Decide whether a proposed mandatory step, check, record, wait, or tool use changes a substantive result or only adds ceremony
- Compare what a finite addition, replacement, or intervention contributes relative to the current configuration
- Clarify what a claim about human, machine, organizational, or cultural “learning” actually says changed
- Clarify what “development” or “evolution” means by naming the changed subject, continuity rule, posture, and value basis
- Probe whether apparent capability loss is really an envelope, support, access, adaptation, enactment, or capability-change issue before choosing redevelopment
- Revalidate affected decisions when a relied-on source changes and the full set of receivers is unknown
- Request or reuse a bounded specialist result while preserving supplier authority and the receiving decision
- Select and combine diagrams, models, records, or other representations for one exact use
- Compare what structure a reader can correctly recover from an explanation under stated preparation, access, and time constraints
- Turn build, buy, reuse, outsource, or AI labels into comparable complete ways to obtain one result
- Check whether advice or an evidence demand helps the recipient’s decision and leads to a feasible next step
- Apply one selected FPF pattern to a current question and stop at the first useful result
- Construct a first model, apply an unfamiliar theory, recover an argument, or revise reasoning after a premise changes
- Connect physical, mathematical, and computational contributions into an interpretable answer
- Design a measurement relation and determine what its indications can actually resolve
- Track object identity across observations, describe constrained configurations, and retain information needed to predict change
- Develop new questions, reusable operations, and branching search from available results

For complex problems, follow paths across multiple sections — the router shows where to start, not where to stop.

### Step 2 — Read the _index.md, then the sub-section

1. Open the `_index.md` of the target section folder — it lists all sub-sections with line counts and descriptions.
2. Read only the specific sub-section file you need.
3. Do NOT load entire sections. Pick the narrowest file that serves the user's question.

### Step 3 — Apply in plain language

Use plain language for the user. Introduce FPF-internal names (U.Holon, Gamma, F-G-R)
only when they add precision the user needs.

### Step 4 — Compose findings across sections

When a problem draws from multiple sections:

1. State each pattern's contribution in one line (e.g., "Bounded Contexts gives us the parts; Trust Calculus scores our confidence in each").
2. If patterns from different sections appear to conflict, check for category errors via A.7 Strict Distinction — the conflict is usually a level confusion (role vs. function, method vs. work), not a real contradiction.
3. Synthesize in natural order: decomposition first (what are the parts?), then evaluation (how confident are we?), then resolution (what do we do about gaps?).
4. Do not just list FPF patterns — weave them into a coherent answer to the user's actual question.

## Starter prompt (example — adapt to the user's actual role and need)

> You have the FPF specification loaded.
> Help me structure my project / problem / programme.
> Use plain language for an engineer-manager.
> Propose: (1) bounded contexts / specialisations, (2) decision criteria, (3) key alternatives,
> (4) hand-offs, and (5) missing evidence or tests before commitment.
> Introduce internal FPF names only when they add precision.

## Section INDEX

Structural reference. Each entry is a folder — read its `_index.md` first, then pick the sub-section.
Counts follow upstream H2 headings; the Preface includes its content-free `FPF.Preface:End` boundary marker.
