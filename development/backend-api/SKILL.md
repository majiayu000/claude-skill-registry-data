name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles with proper HTTP methods, status codes, resource-based URLs, and rate limiting. Use this skill when creating or modifying API endpoints, route handlers, controllers, or any backend API layer code. Apply when working on files that define API routes (routes/*.ts, controllers/*.ts, api/*.ts, *Controller.cs), implement request/response handlers, establish API versioning, or configure endpoint middleware. Use when building Bun/Express APIs, ASP.NET Core Web APIs, or Next.js API routes. This skill ensures RESTful design with clear resource-based URLs, consistent lowercase hyphenated naming, appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), proper status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500), plural nouns for resources (/users, /products), limited nesting depth (2-3 levels max), query parameters for filtering/sorting/pagination, API versioning strategies, and rate limiting headers in responses.

# Backend API

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new API endpoints or route definitions
- When modifying existing API route handlers or controllers
- When working on files that define REST API structure (routes/*.ts, api/*.ts, controllers/*.ts, *Controller.cs)
- When implementing HTTP request/response handling logic
- When designing URL structures and resource naming conventions
- When adding query parameters for filtering, sorting, or pagination
- When implementing API versioning strategies (URL path or headers)
- When defining HTTP status codes for various response scenarios
- When working on rate limiting or API middleware
- When building Bun, Express, Hono, or ASP.NET Core Web API backends
- When implementing Server Actions in Next.js for data mutations
- When configuring CORS, request size limits, or authentication middleware

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.
