 - Public APIs must have docstrings
 - Line length: 120 chars maximum

## Coding Best Practices
 - Early Returns: Use to avoid nested conditions
 - DRY Code: Don't repeat yourself
 - Minimal Changes: Only modify code related to the task at hand
 - Simplicity: Prioritize simplicity and readability over clever solutions
 - Run Tests: Test your code frequently with realistic inputs and validate outputs
