# Semantic ID Constructor

Use this skill to normalize entity identifiers across tools and documents.

## Workflow

1) Collect candidate names, aliases, and source IDs.
2) Define canonical ID rules and collision handling.
3) Output mappings and rationale.
4) Store linkable IDs for retrieval.

## Output expectations

- Provide canonical ID, aliases, and source mappings.
