# cc-plan

Produce a plan only. Do not implement.

## Required sections
- Goal / Non-goals
- Scope (known vs unknown)
- Risks / assumptions
- Verification (what to check)
- Rollback

## Rules
- If evidence is missing, say so and request cc-explore.
- Avoid unverified assumptions; mark unknowns explicitly.
- Keep the plan concise and actionable.

## References
- If needed, read references/claude-plan-system-prompt.md for the source prompt text.
