# Expansion Playbook Library Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing QBRs/EBRs where growth plays should be highlighted.
- Running account reviews to recommend upsell/cross-sell motions.
- Equipping AEs/CSMs with talk tracks and proof aligned to success milestones.

## Framework
1. **Trigger Mapping** – link product usage, milestone completion, or executive asks to specific plays.
2. **Value Narrative** – outline business impact, ROI proof, and reference customers per play.
3. **Commercial Guardrails** – specify packaging, pricing, approvals, and compensation cues.
4. **Enablement Kit** – include decks, ROI calculators, success stories, and objection handling.
5. **Measurement** – track attach rate, win rate, and cycle time for each play.

## Templates
- Play card (trigger, narrative, assets, owners, KPIs).
- Executive talking points for expansion proposals.
- Post-play follow-up checklist with success metrics.

## Tips
- Keep plays prioritized (top 3 per segment) to avoid overwhelm.
- Pair with `account-health-framework` to time plays when risk is low.
- Capture learnings after each motion to refine triggers + messaging.
