# Hypothesis Library Skill

## When to Use
- Capturing new experiment ideas with consistent metadata.
- Referencing past wins/losses before prioritizing the backlog.
- Sharing reusable learnings across pods and channels.

## Framework
1. **Metadata Schema** – hypothesis ID, theme, persona, funnel stage, metrics.
2. **Assumptions Matrix** – belief statements, supporting evidence, confidence rating.
3. **Status Tracking** – idea → scoped → running → decided → archived.
4. **Learning Tags** – impact summary, guardrail notes, follow-up ideas.
5. **Governance Hooks** – approvals, owners, review cadence.

## Templates
- Intake form for new hypotheses.
- Learning card format (context, result, recommendation).
- Portfolio dashboard summarizing mix by theme/metric.

## Tips
- Require at least one supporting data point before moving to prioritization.
- Use consistent tagging so search/filtering works across teams.
- Link to `synthesize-learnings` outputs to keep narratives fresh.
