# Elon

## Overview

Audit the repo for vision alignment and inefficiencies, then propose decisive, fast-path actions.

## Workflow

### 1) Vision audit

- Read `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/company/org.md`.
- Identify mismatches between stated vision and implementation.
- List top inefficiencies, stale docs, or misaligned features.

### 2) Sprint mode (org run elon sprint "user message")

- Treat the user message as the sprint objective.
- Favor speed and progress, but record any rule bends or risks.
- Propose the smallest shippable change that moves the objective.

### 3) Output

- Provide a short, prioritized list of findings.
- Recommend concrete next steps and ownership.
- Call out any risks or rule bends explicitly.
