# Positioning Angles for Therapy Services

Finding the angle that makes therapy services resonate—without crossing CRPO ethical boundaries.

---

## The core job

Therapy marketing requires a delicate balance:
- **Connect emotionally** with people who need help
- **Differentiate** from other therapists
- **Build trust** through credibility signals
- **Stay compliant** with CRPO advertising standards

This skill finds multiple valid positioning angles, each CRPO-compliant, each resonating with different segments of your audience.

**Output format:** 3-5 distinct angle options, each with:
- The angle (one sentence)
- Why it works (the psychology)
- Headline direction (how it would sound in copy)
- When to use it (audience segments, situations)
- **CRPO compliance check** (confirms it's factual and verifiable)

---

## CRPO Compliance First

### MANDATORY Rules for All Angles

**✅ ALLOWED:**
- Factual service descriptions
- Professional credentials (RP, CRPO #10979)
- Therapeutic approaches (ACT, CBT, person-centered)
- Appointment availability (same-week, evening/weekend)
- Geographic service area (Ontario, virtual)
- Insurance receipts offered

**❌ PROHIBITED:**
- Outcome guarantees ("cure anxiety," "fix depression")
- Superlatives without proof ("best therapist," "top-rated")
- Testimonials or client reviews
- Before/after transformation claims
- Success rates (unless from published research)
- Comparative claims ("better than other therapists")

**CRPO Standard 6.2 Summary:**
- All statements must be factual and verifiable
- Cannot suggest CRPO endorsement
- Cannot exaggerate conditions treated
- Must use proper credential display

## The Therapy Angle-Finding Process

### Step 1: Identify the Real Transformation

**NOT:** "Reduce anxiety" (outcome promise)
**YES:** "Learn tools to manage anxious thoughts" (process focus)

**NOT:** "Cure depression" (outcome promise)
**YES:** "Professional support for depression" (service description)

**NOT:** "Fix your relationships" (outcome promise)
**YES:** "Explore relationship patterns in a safe space" (process focus)

**The transformation for therapy:**
- **Feeling understood** (validation, connection)
- **Having tools** (skills, strategies)
- **Having support** (not being alone)
- **Making sense** (patterns, understanding)
- **Taking action** (what therapy helps with, not guarantees)

---

### Step 2: Map the Competitive Landscape

What would clients do if NextStep didn't exist?

**Alternatives:**
1. **Do nothing** (live with problem, hope it gets better)
2. **Self-help** (apps, books, meditation, podcasts)
3. **Talk to friends/family** (free but no expertise)
4. **Medication only** (treat symptoms, not patterns)
5. **Other therapists** (wait lists, poor fits, expensive)
6. **Crisis services** (ER, crisis line - reactive, not ongoing)

**Each alternative has frustrations. Those become angle opportunities.**

**Angle opportunities:**
- **vs. Do nothing:** "You don't have to handle this alone"
- **vs. Self-help:** "Relational therapy vs. app-based solutions"
- **vs. Friends/family:** "Professional space without judgment"
- **vs. Medication only:** "Understand patterns, not just symptoms"
- **vs. Other therapists:** "Same-week availability," "Evening/weekend," "Young male therapist"
- **vs. Crisis:** "Ongoing support before things reach crisis"

---

### Step 3: Find the Unique Mechanism

**For NextStep Therapy:**

**Mechanism:** Relational, person-centered therapy where connection is central—not worksheets, not homework, not being told what to do.

**How to frame it (CRPO-compliant):**
- "Therapy rooted in connection, not worksheets"
- "Curiosity-driven approach vs. prescriptive methods"
- "Operationalizing YOUR language, not clinical jargon"
- "ACT-informed, psychodynamic-influenced, person-centered"
- "Speaking the same language as young professional men"

**Jesse's differentiators (from voice discovery):**
- Relatability (young man who's been through it)
- Not the expert who tells you what to do
- Uses client-generated metaphors
- Works with emotion in the present moment
- Alliance/understanding over technique

---

### Step 4: Assess Market Sophistication

**Stage 3 (Crowded):** Many therapists in Ontario, similar claims, skepticism rising.

**This means:**
- Simple superiority claims won't work ("best therapist in Ontario")
- Need to explain the mechanism (WHY this approach is different)
- Credibility signals matter (CRPO #10979, ACT specialization)
- Specificity cuts through noise (same-week, virtual, young male therapist)

---

### Step 5: Run the Therapy Angle Generators

#### The Relational Angle
**Lead with connection over technique.**

**Frame:**
> "Therapy where connection is everything—not worksheets, not homework, not being told what to do."

**Why it works:**
- Differentiates from CBT apps and workbook therapy
- Addresses frustration with previous therapy
- Alliance is #1 factor in outcomes (research-backed)

**Headline direction:**
> "Relational Therapy for Ontario | Where Understanding Comes First"

**When to use:**
- Audience: Previous therapy felt cold/prescriptive
- Segment: People frustrated with apps/workbooks
- Stage: Problem-aware (know therapy might help)

**CRPO compliance:** ✅ Factual (describes approach, not outcomes)

---

#### The Availability Angle
**Lead with accessibility.**

**Frame:**
> "Same-week virtual appointments. Evening and weekend options. No months-long wait."

**Why it works:**
- Solves #1 barrier (long wait lists)
- Factual and verifiable
- Immediate value proposition

**Headline direction:**
> "Ontario Virtual Therapy | Same-Week Appointments Available"

**When to use:**
- Audience: Urgency (struggling now, not in 3 months)
- Segment: Professionals who can't do 2pm Tuesdays
- Stage: Solution-aware (know they need therapy, need logistics)

**CRPO compliance:** ✅ Factual (verifiable availability)

---

#### The Relatability Angle
**Lead with shared identity.**

**Frame:**
> "Young male therapist for young men dealing with anxiety, burnout, and the gap between who they should be and who they are."

**Why it works:**
- Addresses "speaking the same language"
- Young men often struggle to find relatable therapists
- Specificity creates belonging

**Headline direction:**
> "Therapy for Men in Ontario | Professional, Relatable Support"

**When to use:**
- Audience: Young men (20s-40s)
- Segment: Professionals, high-achievers with imposter syndrome
- Stage: Product-aware (looking for right fit)

**CRPO compliance:** ✅ Factual (describes therapist and target audience)

---

#### The Anti-Expert Angle
**Lead with collaboration, not prescription.**

**Frame:**
> "Person-centered therapy. You're the expert in your own life—therapy provides space to explore, not answers to memorize."

**Why it works:**
- Differentiates from directive/prescriptive approaches
- Appeals to people who felt patronized by previous therapy
- Carl Rogers philosophy (research-backed)

**Headline direction:**
> "Person-Centered Therapy Ontario | Explore, Don't Memorize"

**When to use:**
- Audience: Intellectually curious, resists being told what to do
- Segment: Previous therapy felt condescending
- Stage: Solution-aware (comparing approaches)

**CRPO compliance:** ✅ Factual (describes therapeutic philosophy)

---

#### The Specificity Angle
**Lead with the exact service details.**

**Frame:**
> "Virtual ACT therapy for anxiety. CRPO registered (RP #10979). Same-week availability. Evening and weekend appointments. Insurance receipts provided."

**Why it works:**
- Answers all logistical questions upfront
- Credibility through specifics
- Reduces decision friction

**Headline direction:**
> "ACT Therapy for Anxiety Ontario | CRPO #10979 | Virtual Sessions"

**When to use:**
- Audience: High awareness (ready to book, needs logistics)
- Segment: Direct, no-nonsense people
- Stage: Most aware (just need to know the details)

**CRPO compliance:** ✅ Factual (all verifiable details)

---

#### The Integration Angle
**Lead with the blended approach.**

**Frame:**
> "Integrative therapy: ACT principles, psychodynamic awareness, person-centered philosophy. Not locked into one manual."

**Why it works:**
- Appeals to people frustrated with "one-size-fits-all"
- Shows sophistication and flexibility
- Jesse's actual evolving approach

**Headline direction:**
> "Integrative Therapy Ontario | ACT + Psychodynamic + Person-Centered"

**When to use:**
- Audience: Therapy-savvy, know what CBT/ACT/psychodynamic mean
- Segment: Previous manualized therapy felt limiting
- Stage: Product-aware (comparing therapeutic approaches)

**CRPO compliance:** ✅ Factual (describes approach, not outcomes)

---

## The Test

Before delivering angles, verify each one:

1. **Is it CRPO-compliant?** No outcome guarantees, no testimonials, no superlatives
2. **Is it specific?** "Same-week availability" beats "fast service"
3. **Is it differentiated?** Could another therapist claim the same thing?
4. **Is it believable?** Does evidence support the claim?
5. **Is it relevant?** Does it match the target audience's needs?
6. **Is it empathetic?** Does it acknowledge their experience without dramatizing?

If any answer is no, revise or discard the angle.
