## Overview

Repository governance covers policies, standards, and controls for managing GitHub repositories effectively. This skill includes repository settings, access controls, branch protection, security policies, and best practices for maintaining healthy and secure repositories.

**When to use this skill:** When setting up or managing governance policies for GitHub repositories.

## Governance Framework

### Governance Levels

| Level | Scope | Controls |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Organization** | All repos | Policies, billing, members |
| **Team** | Team repos | Access, permissions |
| **Repository** | Single repo | Settings, protection, rules |
| **Branch** | Branch level | Protection, checks, restrictions |

### Governance Principles

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Security] --> B[Access Control]
    A --> C[Branch Protection]
    A --> D[Secrets Management]
    E[Quality] --> F[Code Review]
    E --> G[CI/CD Gates]
    E --> H[Testing Requirements]
    I[Compliance] --> J[Audit Logging]
    I --> K[Policy Enforcement]
    I --> L[Documentation Standards]
```

### Governance Roles

| Role | Responsibilities | Permissions |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control, billing, settings | Admin |
| **Maintainer** | Code review, merge, settings | Write |
| **Contributor** | Create PRs, issues | Write |
| **Reader** | View only | Read |
| **Security Team** | Security reviews, alerts | Admin |
| **Compliance** | Audit, policy enforcement | Read |

## Access Control

### Permission Levels

| Permission | Read | Write | Admin | Actions |
|-----------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Read** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | View, clone |
| **Triage** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | + Manage issues, PRs |
| **Write** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | + Push branches |
| **Maintain** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | + Manage settings, teams |
| **Admin** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | + Full control |

### Team-Based Access

```yaml
# .github/teams.yml (organization level)
teams:
  - name: backend-team
    permission: admin
    repositories:
      - api-repo
      - service-repo

  - name: frontend-team
    permission: write
    repositories:
      - web-repo
      - mobile-repo

  - name: security-team
    permission: maintain
    repositories:
      - all  # All repositories
```

### CODEOWNERS File

```
# .github/CODEOWNERS

# Global owners
* @tech-lead @security-team

# Directory-specific owners
/api/ @api-team @backend-lead
/frontend/ @frontend-team @frontend-lead
/docs/ @documentation-team

# File pattern owners
*.md @documentation-team
*.sql @database-team
*.yml @devops-team

# Exclusions
.github/ @platform-team
```

### External Collaborators

```bash
# Add outside collaborator
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/collaborators/:username \
  --permission write

# List collaborators
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/collaborators

# Remove collaborator
gh api \
  --method DELETE \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  /repos/:owner/:repo/collaborators/:username
```

## Branch Protection

### Protection Rules

```yaml
# Branch protection settings (via GitHub UI or API)
# Main branch protection:
- Require pull request before merging
- Require approvals: 2 reviewers
- Dismiss stale reviews: 7 days
- Require review from CODEOWNERS
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict who can push: Team only
- Allow force pushes: No
- Require linear history: Yes
```

### Required Status Checks

| Check Type | Purpose | Configuration |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **CI/CD** | Build and deploy | GitHub Actions |
| **Tests** | Unit/integration tests | Test framework |
| **Lint** | Code quality | Linter tool |
| **Security** | Vulnerability scan | Security scanner |
| **Coverage** | Code coverage | Coverage tool |
| **License** | License compliance | License checker |

### Protection Rule Examples

```yaml
# .github/branch-protection.yml
protection_rules:
  - pattern: main
    required_approving_review_count: 2
    required_status_checks:
      - strict: true
        contexts:
          - ci/ci
          - security/scan
    enforce_admins: true
    require_linear_history: true
    allowed_push_users: []

  - pattern: release/*
    required_approving_review_count: 1
    required_status_checks:
      - strict: false
        contexts:
          - ci/ci
    enforce_admins: false
```

## Security Policies

### Dependency Security

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    reviewers:
      - "@security-team"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "security"

  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
```

### Secret Scanning

```yaml
# .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml
name: Secret Scanning

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run secret scanner
        uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog-action@master
        with:
          path: ./
          base: ${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}
          head: HEAD
```

### Security Policies

```markdown
# SECURITY.md

## Security Policy

  -f required_approving_review_count=2
```

### Governance Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Track |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Access review frequency** | Quarterly | Regular access audits |
| **Policy compliance** | 100% | All repos follow policies |
| **Security incidents** | 0 per month | Monitor security alerts |
| **Unauthorized access** | 0 | Audit logs |
| **Template usage** | > 90% | Issues/PRs use templates |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-permissive access** - Grant minimum necessary permissions
2. **No branch protection** - Always protect main branches
3. **Ignoring security alerts** - Respond to vulnerabilities promptly
4. **Outdated collaborators** - Regularly review access
5. **No CODEOWNERS** - Define code ownership clearly
6. **Missing templates** - Use templates for consistency
7. **No audit trail** - Track all governance actions
8. **Inconsistent policies** - Standardize across organization
