# Account Health Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Building dashboards or scorecards for CS/account management reviews.
- Triggering proactive outreach based on usage, sentiment, or commercial shifts.
- Aligning leadership on what defines green/yellow/red customers.

## Framework
1. **Signal Library** – define categories (product usage, support, sentiment, executive alignment, commercial).
2. **Weighting & Thresholds** – assign weights and thresholds per segment/tier.
3. **Automation Hooks** – map scores to alerts, workflows, and CRM fields.
4. **Play Mapping** – connect each tier to recommended plays and owners.
5. **Review Cadence** – set refresh frequency, calibration sessions, and feedback loops.

## Templates
- **Health Scorecard**: See `assets/health_scorecard.md` for calculation and components.
- **Risk/opportunity matrix** with recommended plays.
- **Alert + workflow checklist** for RevOps.

## Tips
- Tune weights by segment to avoid false positives.
- Include qualitative inputs (exec sentiment, champion strength) to supplement data.
- Audit data sources quarterly to maintain trust in the score.
