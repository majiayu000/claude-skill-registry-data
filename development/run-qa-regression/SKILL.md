# QA Regression Runner

This skills goal is to run QA regression tests using the `qa-use` toolkit (MCP). 

For that you should:

1. Check existing QA test cases
2. Define a list of applicable tests that should be run
3. (Recommended) Verify with the user the list of tests to be run
4. Execute the tests in the background
5. Check regularly, or wait for the user to ask for, the test results
6. Analyze and report the results to the user, highlighting any failures or issues found
