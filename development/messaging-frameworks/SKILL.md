## Framework

2. **Support Pillars** – 2-3 proof points with data, customer stories, or analyst quotes.
3. **Evidence** – metrics, testimonials, product differentiators.
4. **Call to Action** – what audiences should think/feel/do next.
5. **Guardrails** – what not to say, words to avoid, regional nuances.
