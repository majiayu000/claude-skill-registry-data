# Global Validation

## When to use this skill

- When implementing form validation on the client side
- When implementing server-side validation for API endpoints or data processing
- When validating data types, formats, ranges, and required fields
- When providing clear, field-specific validation error messages
- When sanitizing user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS, or other attacks
- When using allowlists to define acceptable input rather than blocklists
- When validating business rules like date constraints or balance requirements
- When ensuring validation is applied consistently at all entry points
- When failing early by rejecting invalid data before processing

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global validation.
