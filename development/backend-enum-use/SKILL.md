name: Backend Enum Use
description: Create feature-rich PHP enums following Laravel conventions with SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE case names, backed enum values (string or int), helper methods for labels and comparisons, validation rules, and comprehensive Pest tests. Use this skill when converting hardcoded strings or magic numbers to type-safe enums, creating categorical data types like statuses, types, roles or categories, adding enum-based validation to forms or APIs, refactoring magic strings into structured types, or defining a fixed set of allowed values in your application. This skill applies when working on files in app/Enums/ directory, creating enum classes, adding enum casts to models, or implementing enum validation rules.
