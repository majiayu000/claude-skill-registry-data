# Launch Risk Playbooks Skill

## When to Use
- Pre-launch risk assessments and go/no-go criteria.
- During launch week to monitor escalations and coordinate mitigations.
- Post-launch retros to capture lessons and update future playbooks.

## Framework
Launch risk governance combines categorical coverage with a repeatable execution cadence. Use the following building blocks to keep Tier 1+ launches on track.

### Risk Categories
1. **Product & Reliability** – feature readiness, bugs, infrastructure load, rollback paths.
2. **Go-to-Market** – messaging accuracy, asset approvals, channel readiness, partner alignment.
3. **Compliance & Legal** – policy reviews, privacy terms, licensing, regional constraints.
4. **Support & Success** – staffing levels, escalation handoffs, enablement coverage.
5. **External Factors** – competitor moves, macro events, press sentiment, supply chain.

### Execution Process
1. Identify risks w/ likelihood + impact scoring.
2. Assign owners, mitigation steps, triggers, fallback actions.
3. Maintain real-time risk log during war-room standups.
4. Capture resolution notes + update future tiering guidelines.

## Templates
- Risk register (description, likelihood, impact, owner, mitigation, status).
- Escalation playbook (trigger, communication plan, action tree).
- Lessons learned tracker feeding future launches.

## Tips
- Pre-populate risk banks per tier to accelerate planning.
- Tie mitigations to instrumentation/alerts to catch issues early.
- Share summaries with execs daily during Tier 1 launches.
