# MOC Builder Standards

## Purpose
To turn chaos into order by clustering related notes into a navigable map.

## MOC Structure
1.  **Top Down**: Must start with "Key Concepts" (the most important nodes).
2.  **Bottom Up**: Must group remaining notes by "Sub-topics" or "Clusters".
3.  **Visual**: Should encourage using Graph View (Local) to verify connections.

## Linking
- **Downward**: MOC links to the child notes.
- **Upward**: Child notes SHOULD link back to MOC (`Up: [[MOC]]`) for bidirectional navigation.
