# /hep-cloud

Raw request: `$ARGUMENTS`

Act as the temporary top-level workforce orchestrator. Use the local Agentlas
OS MCP server `hephaestus-network` and call the Workforce tools with exact
`sourceScope: "cloud"`. This command may search only packages owned by the
signed-in Agentlas account. It must not add Local or public Hub candidates.

Every unpinned Cloud discovery asks the owner-scoped source for its current
menu; a client success-cache entry must not hide a newly published, replaced,
or removed package. After validation, preparation remains pinned to the exact
Cloud release selected from that discovery.

Before the first Cloud source call, reuse the installed Agentlas sign-in.
Resolve the runner in this order and use it only for authentication; the host
LLM still performs staffing through the Workforce MCP tools:

```bash
RUNNER=""
for candidate in \
  "$HOME/.agentlas/runtime/current/bin/hephaestus" \
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:+$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/hephaestus}" \
  "${PLUGIN_ROOT:+$PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/hephaestus}" \
  "${GEMINI_EXTENSION_ROOT:+$GEMINI_EXTENSION_ROOT/bin/hephaestus}" \
  "./bin/hephaestus"
do
  if [ -n "$candidate" ] && [ -x "$candidate" ]; then RUNNER="$candidate"; break; fi
done
[ -n "$RUNNER" ] && "$RUNNER" auth ensure >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
```

1. Author a redacted `agentlas.workforce-work-order.v1`; private project
   grounding stays on-host.
2. Call `workforce.search_candidates` with
   `{workOrder, sourceScope: "cloud"}`. Preserve the Cloud source receipt and
   `selectionSessionId`; the projected menu is not a complete
   `federationResult` and must not be echoed as one.
3. Author the final `agentlas.workforce-selection.v1` as the active host LLM,
   then call `workforce.validate_selection` with
   `{workOrder, selection}` and keep the response as `federatedSelection`. Revise on
   rejection; do not accept a
   deterministic picker or unrelated fallback.
4. Call `workforce.prepare_execution` with
   `{workOrder, selection, federatedSelection, projectDir}`. Require every
   selected row to remain pinned to source `cloud`, exact release, package
   hash, content digest, runtime bundle, permission policy, and context digest.
5. Execute distinct planner/manager, worker, synthesis, and verifier calls with
   explicit artifact handoffs. Preserve packaged Team graphs.

Report the exact finite Core refusal—such as `source_unauthorized`,
`source_forbidden`, `source_rate_limited`, `insufficient_credits`, `owner_only`,
`no_cloud_package`, `agent_not_found`, `source_not_supported`, or
`source_unavailable`—with the source receipt. Do not silently search Local or Hub,
call a legacy route, or expose a direct remote `agentlas` MCP alongside Core.
A prepared roster is not proof of execution.

For a `partial` or `failed` result, report each source receipt's exact
`failureCode`. Never collapse several receipts into one, substitute a different
code, or relabel the outcome.
