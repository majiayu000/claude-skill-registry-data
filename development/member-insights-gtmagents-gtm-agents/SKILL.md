# Member Insights Skill

## When to Use
- Monitoring program health across tiers or regions.
- Designing personalization campaigns based on loyalty data.
- Reporting experiment outcomes to stakeholders.

## Framework
1. **Data Sources** – transaction systems, product telemetry, MAP/CRM, support, survey tools.
2. **Segmentation** – tier, lifecycle stage, engagement score, risk/comeback cohorts.
3. **Metrics** – enrollment funnel, active members, point velocity, redemption, incremental revenue.
4. **Experimentation** – define guardrail metrics, success criteria, and monitoring cadence.
5. **Insight Distribution** – dashboards, alerts, and story-driven memos for GTM teams.

## Templates
- KPI scorecard (metric → target → actual → variance → owner).
- Segment heatmap (cohort → engagement → action recommendation).
- Experiment readout template (hypothesis, lift, guardrails, next steps).

## Tips
- Blend quantitative metrics with VOC snippets for context.
- Tag insights with urgency so ops/marketing can prioritize quickly.
- Pair with `monitor-loyalty` command to ensure consistent reporting structure.
