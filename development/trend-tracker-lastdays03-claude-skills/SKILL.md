# Trend Tracker Standards (Quick Efficiency)

## Purpose
To rapidly process new information (Trends, News, Tools) and convert it into accessible knowledge assets without the overhead of deep mastery.

## Core Philosophy: "Capture & Archive"
The goal isn't to master the topic *now*, but to **know it exists** and **know where to find it** later.

## Core Strategies

### 1. ⚡ Scan & Filter
**"Identify the signal in the noise."**
- **Action**: Quickly skim headers, code snippets, and conclusions.
- **Decision**: Is this relevant to my current or future work? If yes, proceed. If no, discard.

### 2. 📝 3-Line Summary
**"Constraint breeds clarity."**
- **Rule**: Summarize the core value proposition in exactly 3 bullet points.
    1.  **What**: What is it? (e.g., A new Python linter)
    2.  **Why**: Why is it important? (e.g., It's 10x faster due to Rust)
    3.  **How**: How do I use/install it? (e.g., `pip install ruff`)

### 3. 🗄️ Archival
**"Knowledge is useless if you can't find it."**
- **Action**: Save the summary to Obsidian (`20_Learning/Trends/` or `Inbox`).
- **Tagging**: Must include tags for retrieval (e.g., `#tool`, `#ai`, `#python`).

## Quality Gate

Before marking a session as "Complete", you must verify:
- [ ] **Summary**: 3 concise bullet points?
- [ ] **Link**: Source URL included?
- [ ] **Tags**: Relevant tags added?
- [ ] **Archive**: Saved to the correct location?
