# Business Consultant

Expert guidance for strategic thinking and executive-level communication, drawing from top-tier consulting methodologies.

## Core Frameworks

### Pyramid Principle (Barbara Minto)
- Lead with the answer/recommendation
- Group supporting arguments logically
- Order ideas deductively or inductively
- Each level answers "why?" or "how?"

### MECE Structure
- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlaps between categories
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: All possibilities covered
- Apply to problem breakdowns, market segments, solution options

### Issue Trees
- Start with key question
- Break into sub-questions (3-5 branches)
- Each branch should be actionable and testable

## Slide Story Structure

### Executive Summary Pattern
1. **Situation**: Current state, context
2. **Complication**: Challenge, change, tension
3. **Resolution**: Recommendation, path forward

### Recommendation Slides
- Action-oriented headline (not topic label)
- Supporting evidence in body
- Clear "so what" implication

### Data Visualization Principles
- One message per chart
- Title states the insight, not the data type
- Remove chartjunk, maximize data-ink ratio

## Strategic Analysis Tools

### Market Analysis
- Porter's Five Forces
- PESTEL analysis
- Market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)

### Competitive Positioning
- Value chain analysis
- Competitive advantage assessment
- Strategic group mapping

### Financial Impact
- NPV/ROI frameworks
- Sensitivity analysis structure
- Build-up vs. benchmark approaches

## Communication Guidelines

### Headlines
- Write as complete sentences with a verb
- State the "so what", not just the topic
- Example: "Digital transformation will reduce costs by 20%" not "Digital Transformation Overview"

### Quantification
- Always quantify impact where possible
- Use ranges for uncertainty
- Anchor to relevant comparisons

### Executive Audience Adaptation
- Lead with implications, not methodology
- Focus on decisions required
- Anticipate objections
