# I Ching Divination Skill

## Overview

The I Ching (易經 / Yì Jīng), or "Book of Changes," is an ancient Chinese divination system dating back over 3,000 years. This skill provides Claude with the knowledge and methodology to perform I Ching consultations using the traditional three-coin method.

## Core Principles

### What is the I Ching?

The I Ching is a philosophical and divination text based on 64 hexagrams, each composed of six lines. These hexagrams represent archetypal situations and their natural transformations. The system recognizes that:

1. **Change is constant** - All situations evolve and transform
2. **Patterns repeat** - Similar circumstances arise in cycles
3. **Balance is key** - Yin and yang forces seek equilibrium
4. **Timing matters** - Knowing when to act or wait is crucial

### Philosophy

- **Non-deterministic**: The I Ching doesn't predict fixed outcomes but reveals the *nature* of the current situation and its potential trajectory
- **Advisory**: Readings provide guidance and perspective, not commands
- **Contextual**: Interpretations must be adapted to the specific question and circumstances
- **Holistic**: Consider all elements—hexagram, lines, changes, and question—as a unified whole

## Hexagram Structure

### Lines

Each hexagram consists of six lines, read from bottom (Line 1) to top (Line 6):

```
Line 6  ═══  or  ═ ═   (Top)
Line 5  ═══  or  ═ ═
Line 4  ═══  or  ═ ═
Line 3  ═══  or  ═ ═
Line 2  ═══  or  ═ ═
Line 1  ═══  or  ═ ═   (Bottom)
```

**Line Types**:
- **═══** Yang (solid line) - Active, strong, masculine, light, heaven
- **═ ═** Yin (broken line) - Receptive, yielding, feminine, dark, earth

### Changing Lines

Lines can be stable or changing:

- **Young Yang (7)**: ═══ - Stable yang, does not change
- **Young Yin (8)**: ═ ═ - Stable yin, does not change
- **Old Yang (9)**: ═══ → ═ ═ - Changing yang, transforms to yin
- **Old Yin (6)**: ═ ═ → ═══ - Changing yin, transforms to yang

**Changing lines indicate**:
- Points of transformation in the situation
- Areas requiring special attention
- The dynamic movement from present to future

### Trigrams

Each hexagram is composed of two trigrams (three-line units):

- **Upper Trigram** (Lines 4-6): Represents the outer situation, what's visible
- **Lower Trigram** (Lines 1-3): Represents the inner situation, what's hidden

**The Eight Trigrams**:
1. ☰ Qián (Heaven) - Creative, strong, father
2. ☷ Kūn (Earth) - Receptive, yielding, mother
3. ☳ Zhèn (Thunder) - Arousing, movement, eldest son
4. ☵ Kǎn (Water) - Abysmal, danger, middle son
5. ☶ Gèn (Mountain) - Stillness, immovable, youngest son
6. ☴ Xùn (Wind) - Gentle, penetrating, eldest daughter
7. ☲ Lí (Fire) - Clinging, clarity, middle daughter
8. ☱ Duì (Lake) - Joyous, pleasure, youngest daughter

## Three-Coin Method

### Why Three Coins?

The three-coin method is the most common modern I Ching divination technique. It's simpler than the traditional 50 yarrow stalks method while maintaining authentic probability distributions.

### The Process

1. **Prepare**: Focus on a clear, specific question
2. **Cast**: Throw three coins six times (once for each line)
3. **Count**: For each throw:
   - Heads = 3
   - Tails = 2
   - Sum the three coins
4. **Interpret**:
   - 6 (three tails) = Old Yin ═ ═ → ═══ (changing)
   - 7 (two heads, one tail) = Young Yang ═══ (stable)
   - 8 (two tails, one head) = Young Yin ═ ═ (stable)
   - 9 (three heads) = Old Yang ═══ → ═ ═ (changing)
5. **Build**: Construct hexagram from bottom (Line 1) to top (Line 6)

### Probability Distribution

- Young Yang (7): 37.5% probability
- Young Yin (8): 37.5% probability
- Old Yang (9): 12.5% probability
- Old Yin (6): 12.5% probability

This creates a natural bias toward stability (75% stable lines) with significant potential for change (25% changing lines).

## Interpretation Method

### Step-by-Step Interpretation

1. **Primary Hexagram**
   - Identify the hexagram number (1-64)
   - Read the Judgment for overall situation
   - Read the Image for symbolic perspective

2. **Changing Lines**
   - If present, read the specific line text(s)
   - These highlight the most dynamic aspects
   - Multiple changes suggest complex transformation

3. **Relating Hexagram**
   - If there are changing lines, determine the relating hexagram
   - This shows the future trajectory or outcome
   - Read its Judgment to understand where things are heading

4. **Synthesis**
   - Integrate all elements into a coherent narrative
   - Apply to the specific question asked
   - Provide both traditional wisdom and contemporary insight

### Interpretation Guidelines

**DO**:
- Ground interpretations in the traditional texts
- Adapt language to contemporary context
- Address the specific question directly
- Acknowledge uncertainty and multiple possibilities
- Emphasize timing and natural flow
- Use metaphor and imagery from the hexagrams

**DON'T**:
- Make absolute predictions
- Ignore changing lines
- Contradict the traditional text
- Insert personal biases
- Oversimplify complex situations
- Provide generic fortune-cookie wisdom

### Handling Multiple Changing Lines

- **No changing lines**: Situation is stable, focus on primary hexagram
- **One changing line**: Clear focal point, read that line specifically
- **Two-three changing lines**: Complex transition, synthesize line meanings
- **Four-five changing lines**: Major upheaval, emphasize relating hexagram
- **Six changing lines**: Complete transformation, special interpretation

## Question Formulation

### Good Questions

The quality of the reading depends on the quality of the question.

**Characteristics of good questions**:
- **Specific**: "Should I accept this job offer?" not "What about my career?"
- **Present-focused**: "What is the nature of this situation?" not "What will happen in 10 years?"
- **Process-oriented**: "How should I approach this?" not "Will I succeed?"
- **Open to guidance**: Genuinely seeking insight, not confirmation

**Examples**:
- ✅ "What should I know about starting this new business venture?"
- ✅ "How can I best navigate this conflict with my partner?"
- ✅ "What is the nature of this opportunity I'm considering?"
- ❌ "Will I be rich?" (too vague, future-focused)
- ❌ "Should I do X or Y?" (too binary, better for open exploration)

## AI-Enhanced Interpretation

### Combining Traditional and Modern

When performing an I Ching reading:

1. **Use the traditional texts** from `references/external/iching-hexagrams.md`
2. **Apply contemporary language** to make wisdom accessible
3. **Contextualize** the reading to the modern situation
4. **Synthesize** multiple elements into coherent guidance

### Personalization

- Consider the querent's specific circumstances
- Use language and metaphors appropriate to their context
- Address their actual concerns, not generic interpretations
- Balance ancient wisdom with practical modern advice

### Tone

- **Respectful**: Honor the tradition and the querent's question
- **Thoughtful**: Provide depth, not superficial fortune-telling
- **Balanced**: Acknowledge both challenges and opportunities
- **Empowering**: Focus on agency and choice, not fatalism
