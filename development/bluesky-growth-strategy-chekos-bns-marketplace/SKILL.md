# Bluesky Growth Strategy Skill

## Platform Overview (December 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Registered users | ~40 million |
| Daily active users | ~4.1 million |
| Growth since Feb 2024 | 3M → 40M |
| Top countries | US (50%), Japan (6%), UK (5%), Germany (5%), Brazil (4%) |

### Key Differentiators

- **No central algorithm** — Users control their feeds
- **No ads** — Organic reach only
- **Decentralized** — Built on AT Protocol
- **Link-friendly** — No penalty for external links
- **Community-driven** — Conversations > broadcasting

## The Three Feed System

### 1. Following Feed (Chronological)
Posts from accounts you follow, in order posted. No algorithmic ranking.

### 2. Discover Feed (Personalized)
Shows what your network is talking about. Surfaces:
- Posts from accounts near your social graph
- Trending discussions among people you follow
- Content from similar audiences

**Key insight**: Replies get surfaced heavily in Discover. Replies = distribution.

### 3. Custom Feeds (User-Created)
Anyone can create algorithmic feeds. Users choose which to subscribe to.

## Starter Packs: The Growth Multiplier

Starter packs drove **up to 43% of all follows** during peak growth periods.

### What Are Starter Packs?

Curated collections of recommended accounts (7-150 people) + up to 3 custom feeds. New users can follow everyone in a pack with one click.

### The Numbers

- **335,000+ starter packs** created in first 6 months
- **~20% of all follow relationships** from June 2024 - January 2025
- Users in starter packs got **85% more followers**
- Users in starter packs posted **60% more**

### Starter Pack Strategy

**Getting Into Starter Packs:**
1. Find relevant starter packs in your niche
2. Engage with the pack creator
3. Message and ask to be added (if appropriate)
4. Provide value that makes inclusion obvious

**Creating Your Own:**
1. Go to your profile → Starter Packs tab
2. Add 7-150 accounts you genuinely recommend
3. Include up to 3 custom feeds
4. Write compelling description
5. Share the link

### Spanish-Language Starter Packs

- 28+ Latin America packs
- 28+ Spanish Language packs
- Growing Hispanic tech/data community

## Custom Feeds: Visibility Strategy

### Why Custom Feeds Matter

Custom feeds are how content gets discovered beyond the Following feed. Getting your posts into relevant feeds = visibility.

### How to Appear in Custom Feeds

Most custom feeds filter by:
- Specific hashtags
- Keywords in posts
- Account lists
- Engagement patterns

**Strategy**: Research which feeds exist in your niche, understand their criteria, then create content that qualifies.

### Creating Your Own Feed

**No-code tools:**
- Bluesky Feed Creator (blueskyfeedcreator.com)
- Graze (graze.social)
- SkyFeed

**Use cases:**
- Curate content for your audience
- Filter spam from topics you care about
- Build niche community hubs

### Feed Discovery Challenge

Only top 50 feeds (by likes) show in discovery. To grow your feed:
- Promote it in posts
- Share direct links
- Ask community to like it

## Growth Principles

### 1. Conversations Over Broadcasting

> "Growth on Bluesky comes from conversations, not just content."

The platform rewards:
- Thoughtful replies
- Quote posts with added value
- Discussion-starting questions
- Genuine engagement

### 2. Niche Specialization

> "By focusing on specific topics and areas of expertise, you can build a dedicated following."

**For tacosdedatos:**
- Data visualization
- Python for data science
- Spanish-language tech education
- Data storytelling

### 3. Quality Over Quantity

> "A smaller, highly engaged audience often delivers better results than larger, passive followings."

Focus metrics:
- Reply rate
- Quote posts
- Profile visits
- Meaningful follows (not just numbers)

## Engagement Tactics

### The 15-Minute Rule

Engage with influencer posts within 15 minutes of posting for maximum visibility. Early replies get more exposure.

### Engagement Targets

Identify 10-20 accounts in your niche with:
- 50,000+ followers (for reach)
- Similar audience (for relevance)
- Active engagement (they reply back)

### Daily Engagement Routine

```
Morning (10 min):
├── Check notifications, reply to all
├── Find 3-5 relevant posts to reply to
└── Post 1 original content

Evening (10 min):
├── Reply to new comments
├── Quote post something valuable
└── Engage in ongoing conversations
```

### Quote Post Strategy

Quote posts are more visible than replies. Use to:
- Add your perspective to trending discussions
- Revive your old high-performing posts
- Share others' content with commentary

## Cross-Platform Promotion

### From Other Platforms to Bluesky
