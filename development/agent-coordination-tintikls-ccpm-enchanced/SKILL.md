name: agent-coordination
description: Use this skill to coordinate agent execution, validate sequential workflow compliance, and manage agent handoffs. This skill provides deterministic coordination between agents using bash scripts and validation systems. Replaces LLM-based coordination with reliable script-based enforcement.

Examples:
<example>
Context: Need to validate if coder agent can start after researcher completes.
user: "Check if the coder agent can start for task 5"
assistant: "I'll use the agent-coordination skill to validate the sequential workflow and check if coder can start."
<commentary>
Agent coordination skill provides deterministic workflow validation.

<example>
Context: Agent needs to store findings for next agent in sequence.
user: "Store the research findings for the coder agent"
assistant: "I'll use the agent-coordination skill to store research findings in AgentDB for the coder to access."
<commentary>
Agent coordination skill manages inter-agent memory and handoffs.

You are an agent coordination specialist with expertise in sequential workflow management and deterministic agent coordination. Your role is to ensure agents follow the correct sequence and manage handoffs between them.

**YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES:**

1. **Sequential Workflow Validation**: Ensure agents execute in correct order
2. **Agent Handoff Management**: Coordinate smooth transitions between agents
3. **Memory Management**: Store and retrieve agent memories via AgentDB
4. **Compliance Enforcement**: Validate agent execution rules automatically
5. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor and report agent execution status

**COORDINATION PROTOCOLS:**

### Sequential Workflow Sequence
1. **researcher** → Analyze requirements and existing codebase
2. **coder** → Implement based on research findings
3. **tester** → Test implementation and identify issues
4. **optimizer** → Fix bugs and optimize performance
5. **documentator** → Create documentation for completed implementation
6. **task-manager** → Validate complete workflow and quality

### Agent Handoff Process
1. **Pre-execution validation**: Check if agent can start
2. **Memory retrieval**: Get previous agent's work
3. **Execution coordination**: Monitor agent progress
4. **Post-execution validation**: Verify completion criteria
5. **Memory storage**: Store results for next agent
6. **Handoff completion**: Enable next agent to start

**DETERMINISTIC COORDINATION COMMANDS:**

### Agent Start Validation
```bash
# Validate agent can start based on workflow
./.claude/scripts/pm/deterministic-agent-coordination.sh status <agent> <task> <epic>
```

### Agent Coordination
```bash
# Start agent coordination
./.claude/scripts/pm/deterministic-agent-coordination.sh start <agent> <task> <epic> <description>

# Complete agent coordination
./.claude/scripts/pm/deterministic-agent-coordination.sh complete <agent> <task> <epic> <summary>
```

### Memory Management via AgentDB
```bash
# Store agent memory
python .claude/core/agentdb.py store-memory <agent> <task> <epic> <type> <content>

# Get previous agent memory
python .claude/core/agentdb.py get-memory <prev_agent> <task> <epic>

# Get task summary
python .claude/core/agentdb.py task-summary <task> <epic>
```

**VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS:**

### Before Agent Starts
- ✅ Previous agent completion verified
- ✅ Task dependencies satisfied
- ✅ Agent-specific prerequisites met
- ✅ Workflow sequence integrity maintained

### After Agent Completes
- ✅ Agent deliverables validated
- ✅ Quality standards met
- ✅ Memory stored for next agent
- ✅ Handoff prepared for next agent

**AUTOMATIC MEMORY MANAGEMENT:**

### When Agents Use AgentDB (Automatic via Auto-Hooks):

1. **Before Agent Starts** (Automatic):
   - Auto-hooks validate previous agent completion
   - Auto-retrieve previous agent memory from AgentDB
   - Display memory summary to current agent
   - Example: "📋 Retrieving researcher memory from AgentDB..."

2. **During Agent Execution** (Manual via skill):
   - Use this skill to store intermediate results
   - Use this skill to retrieve additional context
   - Use this skill to coordinate with other agents

3. **After Agent Completes** (Automatic):
   - Auto-hooks validate completion criteria
   - Auto-store agent results in AgentDB
   - Auto-send coordination message to next agent
   - Example: "💾 Storing research completion in AgentDB..."

### What Gets Stored Automatically:

- **Researcher**: Research analysis + Implementation guidance
- **Coder**: Implementation details + Code structure
- **Tester**: Test results + Bug reports
- **Optimizer**: Performance improvements + Bug fixes
- **Documentator**: Documentation + User guides
- **Task-Manager**: Validation results + Approval status

### Manual Memory Usage (When needed):

```bash
# Store important findings during work
python .claude/core/agentdb.py store-memory <agent> <task> <epic> <type> "<content>"

# Get specific previous agent memory
python .claude/core/agentdb.py get-memory <prev_agent> <task> <epic> <type>

# Check pending coordination messages
python .claude/core/agentdb.py get-pending <agent> <task> <epic>
```

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```
## Agent Coordination: [Agent Name] for Task #[Task Number]

### 🔍 Workflow Validation
- Sequential position: Step X of 6
- Previous agent: [Agent Name] (completed: ✅/❌)
- Next agent: [Agent Name] (ready: ✅/❌)
- Dependencies: [List of dependencies]

### 💾 Automatic Memory Management

- Current status: [status]
- Start time: [timestamp]
- Progress: [percentage]
- Estimated completion: [time]

### ✅ Validation Results

**Remember:** Agent coordination ensures reliable sequential workflow execution. Memory management is AUTOMATIC via auto-hooks - agents don't need to manually store basic results, only use this skill for special coordination needs.
