# Writing Substack Notes

Create engaging Substack Notes that spark genuine conversations, build community, and grow your subscriber base.

## What Are Notes?

Notes are Substack's short-form content format—similar to tweets but without character limits. They appear in the Notes feed and are designed for discovery, engagement, and community building.

**Key differences from newsletters**:
- No subject lines (not delivered via email)
- Shorter format (50-150 words optimal)
- Discoverable in the Notes feed
- Algorithm rewards genuine engagement
- Content can surface for days/weeks (unlike Twitter)

## Core Principles

### Community First
Engage with others' Notes before posting your own. Substack Notes rewards genuine community participation, not broadcasting.

### Conversation Over Content
Notes that spark discussion outperform polished content. Ask questions. Invite responses. Be curious.

### Story Over Advice
Notes that open with story moments get 3x more engagement than those opening with advice or tips.

### Authenticity Over Perfection
The algorithm surfaces genuine voices, not polished performances. Sound human, not like a bot.

## Optimal Note Structure

### Length
- **Sweet spot**: 50-100 words (~87 words average for viral Notes)
- **Maximum**: 300 words for micro-stories
- 3-5 sentences is often enough

### Formatting
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Line breaks between thoughts
- Make the main point jump out immediately
- White space aids scanning

## Note Formats

### Short Wisdom
One insight delivered in 1-3 lines. Like a quote or proverb.

Best for: Quick observations, reframings, aha moments

### Micro-Story
A brief anecdote (under 300 words) building to a single insight. Often starts in the middle of the action.

Best for: Personal experiences, lessons learned

### List/Countdown
Bullet points or numbered lines centered on a theme.

Best for: Quick tips, observations, curated ideas

### Question/Invitation
Open-ended question that invites community response.

Best for: Sparking discussion, learning from audience

### Behind-the-Scenes
Share your process, works in progress, or creative journey.

Best for: Building connection, showing authenticity

### Restack with Commentary
Share someone else's Note or post with your perspective added.

Best for: Community building, adding value to conversations

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone
- Conversational, not performative
- Honest, not polished
- Curious, not authoritative
- Personal, not generic

### What Works
- Contrarian takes (3-4x more engagement than "helpful tips")
- Emotional resonance (make readers feel seen)
- Vulnerability and honesty
- Questions that invite real responses
- Story openings, not advice openings

### What to Avoid
- Sounding like a bot or AI
- Generic advice without personal context
- Hot takes without substance
- Engagement bait without value
- Treating Notes like tweets or LinkedIn posts

## Engagement Strategy

### The First Hour Is Critical
- Notes with 10+ comments in the first hour are 5x more likely to go viral
- Respond to every comment in the first hour
- 5-10 genuine conversations can trigger algorithm amplification

### Daily Rhythm (Optional)
1. **Morning**: Community Note—invite participation, ask a question
2. **Midday**: Educational Note—one clear insight with your take
3. **Evening**: Reflective Note—honest thoughts, encouragement

### Community Building
- Comment thoughtfully on other writers' Notes daily
- Restack content you genuinely value with added commentary
- Build relationships with 3-5 new writers weekly
- Support others consistently—they'll notice and reciprocate

## Growth Mechanics

### Algorithm Signals
- Early engagement matters more than follower count
- Genuine conversation > vanity metrics
- A Note from someone with 100 followers can outperform one with 10,000+
- Content can surface for days/weeks (unlike other platforms)

### Subscriber Conversion
- Notes drive discovery → profile visits → newsletter subscriptions
- Every interaction nudges readers closer to subscribing
- Writers who subscribe often become recommenders

## Quick Checklist

1. Is this under 100 words? (Or under 300 for a micro-story?)
2. Does it sound like me, not a bot?
3. Would this spark a conversation?
4. Am I opening with story/observation, not advice?
5. Is there something for readers to respond to?
6. Have I engaged with others' Notes today?
