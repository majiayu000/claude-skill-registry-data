## When to Use
- Updating quarterly or monthly channel strategies.
- Aligning stakeholders on goals, KPIs, and experimentation focus.
- Communicating trade-offs on budget, bandwidth, and channel mix.

## Framework
1. **Channel Mandates** – define role, audience, KPIs, and health metrics per platform.
2. **Goal & KPI Stack** – connect business objectives to reach, engagement, demand metrics.
3. **Content & Experiment Pillars** – document themes, tentpoles, evergreen programs, and tests.
4. **Budget & Resourcing** – allocate spend, creators, tooling, and operational support.
5. **Governance** – approval flow, compliance requirements, and risk watchlist.

## Templates
- Channel one-pager (overview, KPIs, status, experiments).
- Quarterly roadmap deck with heatmap view of initiatives.
- Budget + resource tracker with justification notes.

## Tips
- Keep a running backlog of experiments to plug into future quarters.
- Pair qualitative insight slides with KPI clips for executive storytelling.
