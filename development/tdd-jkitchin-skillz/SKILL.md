# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Skill

Guide users through disciplined test-first development using the red-green-refactor cycle.

## Core TDD Workflow

**RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → REPEAT**

### RED: Write a Failing Test
1. Identify next small behavior to implement
2. Write test that specifies that behavior
3. Run test to verify it **fails for the right reason**
4. If test passes unexpectedly, test is wrong

### GREEN: Make It Pass
1. Write **minimal** code to make test pass
2. Don't worry about perfection yet
3. Simplest solution that works
4. Run test to verify it passes

### REFACTOR: Improve the Code
1. Improve code quality while keeping tests green
2. Remove duplication
3. Improve names and structure
4. Run tests after each change to ensure still passing

### REPEAT
1. Commit when tests are green
2. Identify next behavior
3. Start cycle again with new test

## TDD Discipline

**Critical rules to follow:**

### Test First (RED Phase)
- **Always write test before implementation**
- Resist urge to write code first
- Test defines what "done" means
- See test fail before making it pass

### Minimal Implementation (GREEN Phase)
- **Write simplest code to pass**
- Don't over-engineer
- Don't add features not tested
- One test at a time

### Refactor Only When Green
- **Never refactor with failing tests**
- Keep tests passing during refactoring
- Small, incremental improvements
- Run tests after each refactoring step

### Run Tests Frequently
- After writing test (should fail)
- After writing implementation (should pass)
- After each refactoring step (should stay green)
- Before committing

## When to Use This Skill

Activate for requests involving:
- "Use TDD for..." / "Test-driven development..."
- "Write tests first..." / "Red-green-refactor..."
- Developing new features test-first
- Learning TDD practices
- Setting up test infrastructure
- Test design and organization

## Test Structure Patterns

### Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)
**Arrange** - Set up test data and environment
**Act** - Execute the code under test
**Assert** - Verify the results

```python
def test_add_two_numbers():
    calculator = Calculator()           # Arrange
    result = calculator.add(2, 3)      # Act
    assert result == 5                  # Assert
```

### Given-When-Then (BDD Style)
**Given** - Initial context/preconditions
**When** - Action/event occurs
**Then** - Expected outcome

## Test Design Principles

### What to Test
- **Public interface** - Test behavior users depend on
- **Edge cases** - Boundaries, empty inputs, max values
- **Error conditions** - Invalid inputs, exceptions
- **Business logic** - Core algorithms and rules
- **Integration points** - Where components interact

### What NOT to Test
- **Private implementation details** - Test behavior, not internals
- **Third-party libraries** - Trust they work, test your usage
- **Simple getters/setters** - Unless they have logic
- **Framework code** - Test your code, not the framework

### One Behavior Per Test
- Each test should verify single behavior
- Makes failures easier to diagnose
- Keeps tests focused and readable
- Prefer multiple small tests over one large test

### Make Tests Readable
- **Descriptive names** - `test_add_returns_sum_of_two_positive_numbers`
- **Clear structure** - AAA or Given-When-Then
- **Self-documenting** - Test shows how code should be used
- **Minimal setup** - Only what's needed for this test

### Keep Tests Independent
- Tests should not depend on each other
- Tests can run in any order
- Each test starts with clean state
- No shared mutable state between tests

See `references/test-design-patterns.md` for comprehensive guidance.

## Language-Specific Guidance

### For Python
See `references/python-tdd.md` for:
- pytest and unittest frameworks
- Fixtures and parametrized tests
- Mocking with unittest.mock
- Testing async code
- Coverage with pytest-cov
- Running and organizing tests

### For Emacs Lisp
See `references/elisp-tdd.md` for:
- ERT (Emacs Lisp Regression Testing)
- Testing interactive functions
- Buffer manipulation testing
- Mocking with cl-letf
- Buttercup (BDD alternative)
- Running tests in Emacs and batch mode

### For Other Languages
See `references/general-tdd.md` for:
- Finding testing frameworks
- Universal test patterns
- Common testing concepts
- Build tool integration
- Language-agnostic principles

## Test Types and When to Use

### Unit Tests
**What:** Test individual functions/methods in isolation

**When:**
- Testing pure functions
- Testing business logic
- Testing algorithms
- Fast, focused tests

**Example:** `test_calculate_discount(price, percentage)`

### Integration Tests
**What:** Test multiple components working together

**When:**
- Testing database interactions
- Testing API calls
- Testing service integration
- Verifying components connect correctly

**Example:** `test_user_service_saves_to_database()`

### End-to-End Tests
**What:** Test complete user workflows

**When:**
- Testing critical user paths
- Verifying system as a whole
- Smoke tests for deployment

**Example:** `test_user_can_register_and_login()`

**Test Pyramid:**
```
      /\      ← Few E2E tests (slow, brittle)
     /  \
    / IT \    ← Some Integration tests
   /______\
  /  Unit  \  ← Many Unit tests (fast, focused)
 /__________\
```

## TDD Red-Green-Refactor Example

**Goal:** Implement factorial function

**Iteration 1 - Base case:**
- RED: `test_factorial_of_zero_is_one()` → ❌ factorial not defined
- GREEN: `def factorial(n): return 1` → ✅ Passes
- REFACTOR: Nothing yet. Commit.

**Iteration 2 - Positive numbers:**
- RED: `test_factorial_of_five()` expects 120 → ❌ Got 1
- GREEN: Implement loop to calculate factorial → ✅ Passes
- REFACTOR: Use recursion for elegance → ✅ Still passes. Commit.

**Iteration 3 - Error handling:**
- RED: `test_factorial_negative_raises_error()` → ❌ No error raised
- GREEN: Add if n < 0: raise ValueError → ✅ All tests pass
- REFACTOR: Add docstring → ✅ Still passes. Commit.

**Done!** Function is complete, fully tested, documented. Three test-driven iterations.

## Mocking and Test Doubles

### When to Mock
- **External dependencies** - Databases, APIs, file systems
- **Slow operations** - Network calls, large computations
- **Unpredictable behavior** - Random, time-dependent, external state
- **Hard to trigger scenarios** - Error conditions, edge cases

### When NOT to Mock
- **Your own code** - Prefer real objects for your code
- **Simple objects** - Data classes, value objects
- **Logic being tested** - Don't mock what you're testing

### Types of Test Doubles

**Mock** - Programmed with expectations, verifies interactions
**Stub** - Provides canned responses, doesn't verify
**Fake** - Working implementation, simpler than real
**Spy** - Records calls, allows verification after

See `references/test-design-patterns.md` for detailed mocking strategies.

## Common TDD Anti-Patterns

**Don't:**

❌ **Write implementation before test** - Defeats TDD purpose

❌ **Write multiple tests before making them pass** - Stay in rhythm (one test, make it pass, next test)

❌ **Refactor with red tests** - Only refactor when green

❌ **Test implementation details** - Test behavior, not internals

❌ **Skip refactor step** - Technical debt accumulates

❌ **Write tests that are hard to understand** - Tests are documentation

❌ **Create dependencies between tests** - Tests must be independent

❌ **Mock everything** - Use real objects when practical

❌ **Fake it with hardcoded values forever** - "Fake it till you make it" is temporary

❌ **Write slow tests** - Slow test suite won't be run frequently

## Test Naming Conventions

**Good test names are descriptive and specific:**

### Pattern: `test_<function>_<scenario>_<expected_result>`
```python
test_add_two_positive_numbers_returns_sum()
test_add_with_negative_number_returns_correct_result()
test_add_with_zero_returns_other_number()
```

### Pattern: `should_<expected_behavior>_when_<condition>`
```python
should_return_empty_list_when_no_items_match()
should_raise_error_when_input_is_null()
should_calculate_discount_when_user_is_premium()
```

### Pattern: `<behavior>_<state>_<expected>`
```elisp
(ert-deftest save-buffer-modified-saves-to-file ())
(ert-deftest load-file-missing-raises-error ())
```

**Test name should:**
- Describe what's being tested
- Describe the scenario/condition
- Describe expected outcome
- Be readable as documentation

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure

**Python:**
```
project/
├── src/
│   └── calculator.py
└── tests/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── test_calculator.py
    └── conftest.py  # pytest fixtures
```

**Elisp:**
```
package/
├── my-package.el
└── test/
    └── test-my-package.el
```

### Naming Conventions
- Test files: `test_*.py`, `*_test.py`, `test-*.el`
- Test functions: Start with `test_` or `ert-deftest`
- Test classes: `Test*` (if using classes)

### Grouping Tests
- One test file per source file (generally)
- Group related tests in same file
- Separate unit/integration/e2e tests

See language-specific references for detailed organization patterns.

## Refactoring with Tests

### Safe Refactoring Process

1. **Ensure all tests are green** before starting
2. **Make small changes** - One refactoring at a time
3. **Run tests after each change** - Catch breaks immediately
4. **Commit frequently** - When tests pass
5. **Don't add features while refactoring** - Separate concerns

### Common Refactorings
- Extract function (break up large functions)
- Rename for clarity
- Remove duplication (DRY)
- Simplify conditional logic
- Extract variable for readability
- Inline unnecessary abstraction

### When Tests Break During Refactoring

**If test is testing implementation detail:**
- Update test to test behavior instead
- Make test more resilient to changes

**If test is testing behavior:**
- Fix the code, not the test
- Behavior shouldn't change during refactoring

**If too many tests break:**
- Change is too large, revert
- Make smaller incremental changes

See `references/refactoring-with-tests.md` for detailed guidance.

## Test Coverage

**Coverage measures which code is executed by tests, not whether tests are good.**

### Types of Coverage
- **Line coverage** - Which lines executed
- **Branch coverage** - Which paths taken
- **Function coverage** - Which functions called

### Coverage Goals
- Aim for high coverage (80%+) but not 100%
- 100% coverage doesn't mean bug-free
- Focus on critical code paths
- Don't test just to increase coverage

### Using Coverage Tools
- **Python:** pytest-cov, coverage.py
- **JavaScript:** Jest with coverage
- **Java:** JaCoCo
- **Ruby:** SimpleCov

Use `scripts/coverage_analyzer.py` to identify coverage gaps.

## Quick Reference

**TDD Cycle:**
1. RED - Write failing test
2. GREEN - Make it pass (minimal code)
3. REFACTOR - Improve while keeping green
4. REPEAT

**Test Structure:**
- Arrange (setup)
- Act (execute)
- Assert (verify)

**Test Principles:**
- Test first
- One test at a time
