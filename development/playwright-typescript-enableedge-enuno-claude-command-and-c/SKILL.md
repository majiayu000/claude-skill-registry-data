## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/enableedge/playwright-typescript-enableedge.git
cd playwright-typescript-enableedge

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install
```

## Usage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run UI tests
npm run test:ui

# Run API tests
npm run test:api

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- <path-to-test-file>
```

### Playwright MCP Setup

**Enable AI-Assisted Test Generation:**

1. Install Playwright VS Code extension
2. Enable MCP in VS Code settings:
   ```json
   {
     "playwright.mcp.enabled": true
   }
   ```
3. Start MCP server via Command Palette
4. Describe test scenarios in natural language
5. MCP generates corresponding Playwright test code

**Key Capability:** Convert natural language test descriptions into executable Playwright test code with proper browser interaction automation.

## AI-Assisted Test Generation

The framework demonstrates how to:
- Use natural language to describe test scenarios
- Generate Playwright test code automatically
- Follow modern testing best practices
- Create maintainable test suites with AI assistance
- Integrate with GitHub Copilot for code suggestions

## Page Object Model (POM)

The framework implements POM for:
- Reusable page components
- Better test maintainability
- Separation of test logic from page structure
- Scalable test architecture

## Allure Reporting

Integrated Allure Report provides:
- Comprehensive test execution reports
- Visual test results
- Historical trend analysis
- Test categorization and tagging
