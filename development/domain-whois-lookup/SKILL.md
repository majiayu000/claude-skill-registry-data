## How to Use

The domain WHOIS tool provides comprehensive domain intelligence:

## Examples

**Website legitimacy check:**
```

Investigation: Registered 2 weeks ago, privacy protection enabled
Red flags: Recent registration, no business address, temporary email

```

Assessment: Legitimate business domain with consistent registration
```

**Phishing investigation:**
```
Suspicious Domain: paypaI-secure.com (note capital i)

## Important Notes

- WHOIS data accuracy varies - many registrations use privacy protection
- Historical WHOIS data may provide more information than current records
- Some ccTLD (country code) domains have different disclosure rules
- Privacy/proxy services can obscure true ownership information
- Cross-reference domain data with website content and hosting information
- Consider domain age in assessing website legitimacy
- Be aware of GDPR impact on WHOIS data availability in Europe
- Technical contacts may differ from actual website owners/operators
- Use multiple WHOIS databases for comprehensive information
