# LinkedIn Content Strategy Skill

## The 2025 LinkedIn Reality

Key shifts:
- **Average reach down 34%** — Quality matters more than ever
- **Comments up 37% YoY** — Active participation over passive consumption
- **Evergreen content** — Posts can resurface for weeks
- **Topic authority** — Consistent niche posting = algorithm recognition
- **Authenticity wins** — Personal stories outperform corporate messaging

## Core Strategy Framework

### The 1-5-10 Rule

For consistent growth:
```
1 post/day (or 3-4/week minimum)
5 meaningful comments/day on others' posts
10 minutes engaging in your niche
```

### Content Pillars for tacosdedatos

| Pillar | % | Examples |
|--------|---|----------|
| Educational | 40% | Tutorials, frameworks, how-tos |
| Thought Leadership | 25% | Industry insights, opinions, trends |
| Personal/Story | 20% | Lessons learned, behind-scenes |
| Community | 15% | Celebrating others, asking questions |

## The Commenting Strategy

Commenting often produces better results than posting alone.

### Why It Works

- Comments on your posts boost engagement by 30%
- Posts with comments get 60% more views
- 10-20 comments/day can increase profile views by 50%
- Meaningful comment exchanges lead to 52% reply rate on follow-up messages (vs 18% cold)

### Commenting Best Practices

**Do:**
- Write 10+ words (thoughtful > generic)
- Add value: insights, examples, data
- Ask follow-up questions
- Comment on posts from accounts with 50K+ followers for visibility
- Reply to comments on your own posts within the "golden hour"

**Don't:**
- Generic praise ("Great post!")
- AI-generated comments (detectable, hurts reputation)
- Engagement bait ("Comment YES if...")
- Comment pods (penalized by algorithm)

### Daily Commenting Routine

```
Morning (10 min):
- Check notifications, reply to comments on your posts
- Comment on 3-5 posts from key accounts in your niche

Lunch (5 min):
- Quick engagement scan
- 2-3 thoughtful comments

Evening (5 min):
- Reply to new comments on your posts
- 2-3 comments on trending content in your field
```

## Weekly Content Calendar

### Sample Schedule (tacosdedatos)

| Day | Content Type | Format |
|-----|--------------|--------|
| Monday | Industry insight / tip | Text post |
| Tuesday | Tutorial / How-to | Carousel |
| Wednesday | — | Commenting only |
| Thursday | Story / Lesson learned | Text post |
| Friday | Poll or discussion starter | Poll |

### Posting Rhythm

- **Minimum**: 2-3 posts/week
- **Optimal**: 4-5 posts/week
- **Never**: Skip commenting days

## Building Topic Authority

LinkedIn rewards consistent expertise in specific topics.

### How to Build Authority

1. **Pick 2-3 core topics** (e.g., data visualization, Python, Spanish tech content)
2. **Post consistently** about these topics
3. **Use similar language/terms** across posts
4. **Engage with others** posting about same topics
5. **Over time**: Algorithm recognizes you as expert, boosts distribution

### Content Themes for tacosdedatos

```
Primary: Data visualization, Python for data science
Secondary: Spanish-language tech education, data storytelling
Tertiary: Behind-the-scenes of creating content
```

## Newsletter Promotion on LinkedIn

LinkedIn penalizes external links. Smart promotion requires strategy.

### The Two-Post Method

**Post 1 (Day of newsletter):**
```
[Key insight or teaser from newsletter]

[2-3 supporting points]

Full breakdown in today's newsletter — link in comments 👇

What's your experience with [topic]?
```

**Post 2 (2-3 days later):**
```
[Different angle on same topic]

[Value that stands alone]

I wrote about this in depth recently.
DM me "newsletter" if you want the link.
```

### Carousel Summary Strategy

Instead of linking to newsletter:
1. Create carousel with key points from article
2. End slide: "This is from my newsletter tacosdedatos"
3. CTA: "Follow for more data content in Spanish"

## Engagement Metrics & Benchmarks

### What to Track

| Metric | Good | Great |
|--------|------|-------|
| Engagement rate | 4%+ | 6%+ |
| Impressions/post | 1K+ | 5K+ |
| Comments/post | 5+ | 20+ |
| Profile views/week | 100+ | 500+ |
| Connection acceptance | 30%+ | 50%+ |

### Dwell Time (The Hidden Metric)

LinkedIn measures how long people read your content. Optimize for:
- Compelling hooks that earn "see more" clicks
- Formatting that keeps people reading
- Carousels that encourage swiping
- Comments that extend discussion

## Personal Brand vs Company Page

Personal profiles outperform company pages on LinkedIn.

### Strategy

- **Personal profile**: Primary content channel (higher reach)
- **Company page**: Reposts, official announcements
- **Employee advocacy**: Team members sharing company content gets 8x more engagement

For tacosdedatos (one-person operation): Focus entirely on personal profile.

## Content Repurposing

### From Newsletter to LinkedIn

```
Newsletter article (2000 words)
↓
LinkedIn carousel (10 slides with key points)
↓
Text post (different angle, next day)
↓
Poll (related question, later in week)
```

### Cross-Platform Adaptation

| Platform | LinkedIn Version |
|----------|-----------------|
| Twitter thread | Carousel with expanded points |
| Instagram Reel | Behind-scenes story about the topic |
| Blog post | Key insight + "full article in comments" |

## Campaign Templates

### Product/Course Launch (2 Weeks)

```
Week -1:
- Teaser post: "I'm working on something..."
- Behind-scenes content
- Poll: "Would you be interested in [topic]?"

Launch Week:

- Day 2: Testimonial/social proof
- Day 3: FAQ post
