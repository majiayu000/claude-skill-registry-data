# Advocacy Roster System Skill

## When to Use
- Building or refreshing reference customer pools and advisory boards.
- Evaluating which customers are ready for public storytelling or beta participation.
- Monitoring engagement health and risk signals for active advocates.

## Framework
1. **Scoring Model** – satisfaction, product breadth, results achieved, relationship strength, legal clearance.
2. **Engagement Calendar** – cadence for check-ins, stories, events, and feedback loops.
3. **Risk Monitoring** – signals for overuse, upcoming renewals, competitive threats.
4. **Compliance Layer** – NDAs, consent tracking, brand guidelines, incentive policies.
5. **Reporting** – dashboards for advocate pipeline, coverage by persona/industry, and influence on revenue.

## Templates
- Roster spreadsheet/Notion DB with scoring, health, assignments.
- Advocate briefing doc with key facts, proof points, and guardrails.
- Quarterly council recap + next-step template.

## Tips
- Limit outreach frequency and segment advocates to avoid fatigue.
- Align with CS/AM owners before committing customers to references.
- Pair with `activate-advocacy-program` command for turnkey campaign launch.
