# Inngest Skill Router

This repository vendors official Inngest agent skills for integration work.
Use this router only to choose the specific skill to load next.

## This Repository

- Inngest is currently planned or referenced in this repo, not an app runtime
  dependency.
- Do not add runtime packages, app code, migrations, or `INNGEST_*` env vars
  unless the user explicitly asks for product Inngest integration and the work
  has its own OpenSpec scope.
- Inngest skills are subordinate to OpenSpec, root `AGENTS.md`, repo rulebooks,
  framework docs, and runtime evidence.

## Checklist

- [ ] Confirm whether the repo already has Inngest runtime code.
- [ ] Load the most specific official Inngest skill for the task.
- [ ] Keep product runtime adoption out of agent-tooling-only changes.
- [ ] Use the Inngest dev-server MCP only when the dev server is running and
      the configured port matches the active server.
