## Hermeneutics

### Gadamer: Philosophical Hermeneutics

**Central Insight**: Understanding is always situated

**Key Concepts**:
```
GADAMERIAN HERMENEUTICS
═══════════════════════

PREJUDICE (Vorurteil)
├── Not negative; pre-judgment necessary for understanding
├── We always approach texts with expectations
└── Productive: enables understanding

HORIZON
├── Range of vision from a particular standpoint
├── Limited but expandable
└── Understanding as "fusion of horizons"

TRADITION (Überlieferung)
├── We stand in tradition; cannot step outside
├── Tradition is enabling, not just constraining
└── Classics speak across time

DIALOGUE
├── Understanding as conversation
├── Question-answer structure
└── The text puts questions to us

EFFECTIVE-HISTORICAL CONSCIOUSNESS
├── Awareness that we are shaped by history
├── No "view from nowhere"
└── Self-understanding through historical situatedness
```

**Hermeneutic Circle**:
- Parts understood through whole
- Whole understood through parts
- Not vicious but productive
- Entry through fore-understanding

### Ricoeur: Hermeneutics of Suspicion

**Two Hermeneutics**:
1. **Hermeneutics of Trust**: Receive meaning
2. **Hermeneutics of Suspicion**: Unmask hidden forces

**Masters of Suspicion**:
| Thinker | Hidden Force | Unmasked |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Marx | Economic interests | Ideology as false consciousness |
| Nietzsche | Will to power | Morality as ressentiment |
| Freud | Unconscious desire | Consciousness as surface |

---

## Critical Theory (Frankfurt School)

### Core Project

**Critique of Instrumental Reason**:
- Enlightenment promised liberation through reason
- But reason became instrumental (means-ends calculation)
- Domination of nature → domination of humans
- Modern society: administered, reified, unfree

### Horkheimer & Adorno: Dialectic of Enlightenment

**Thesis**: Enlightenment contains seeds of its own destruction

**The Culture Industry**:
```
CULTURE INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
═════════════════════════

MASS CULTURE
├── Standardized products (films, music, etc.)
├── Pseudo-individualization (apparent variety, deep sameness)
├── Entertainment as distraction
└── Forecloses critical thought

EFFECTS
├── Passivity: spectators, not participants
├── Conformity: think like everyone else
├── False needs: created by advertising
└── Regression: infantilization

TOTALITY
├── No outside: culture industry is everywhere
├── Resistance absorbed: rebellion becomes style
└── Art reduced to commodity
```

### Marcuse: One-Dimensional Man

**Thesis**: Advanced industrial society creates "one-dimensional" humans

**Concepts**:
| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Repressive desublimation | Sexual liberation that serves domination |
| False needs | Needs imposed by social systems |
| The Great Refusal | Rejection of the whole system |
| One-dimensionality | Loss of critical negativity |

### Benjamin: Art and History

**The Aura**:
- Unique presence of original artwork
- "Here and now" of authentic existence
- Mechanical reproduction destroys aura
- Ambivalent: loss of cult value, gain of political potential

**Theses on History**:
- History as continuous catastrophe
- "Angel of History" blown backward by progress
- Revolutionary interruption of continuum
- "Brush history against the grain"

### Habermas: Communicative Reason

**Critique of First Generation**:
- Too pessimistic about reason
- Performative contradiction: using reason to critique reason
- Need to distinguish types of reason

**Solution**:
```
TWO TYPES OF REASON
═══════════════════

INSTRUMENTAL REASON
├── Means-ends calculation
├── Technical control
├── Monological
└── System/lifeworld colonization

COMMUNICATIVE REASON
├── Oriented to understanding
├── Intersubjective, dialogical
├── Validity claims (truth, rightness, sincerity)
└── Ideal speech situation
```

**Ideal Speech Situation**:
- All affected can participate
- Everyone has equal voice
- Only force of better argument
- No coercion, manipulation

---

## Post-Structuralism

### Foucault: Power/Knowledge

**Against Traditional History**:
- Not continuous progress
- Not driven by ideas or great figures
- Discontinuities, ruptures, epistemic shifts

**Methods**:
```
FOUCAULDIAN METHODS
═══════════════════

ARCHAEOLOGY
├── Uncover historical conditions of knowledge
├── Episteme: unconscious structure governing discourse
├── Not what people thought but what made thought possible
└── Works: Order of Things, Archaeology of Knowledge

GENEALOGY
├── Influenced by Nietzsche
├── History of the present
├── Trace contingent origins, not essences
├── Power relations, not truth
└── Works: Discipline and Punish, History of Sexuality
```

**Power/Knowledge**:
```
POWER/KNOWLEDGE NEXUS
═════════════════════

TRADITIONAL VIEW:
Power represses → Knowledge liberates

FOUCAULT:
Power and knowledge are inseparable
- Knowledge is a form of power
- Power produces knowledge
- No neutral position

DISCIPLINARY POWER
├── Modern form of power
├── Operates through norms, surveillance
├── Produces docile bodies
├── Panopticon as model
└── Schools, prisons, hospitals, factories

BIOPOWER
├── Power over populations
├── Statistics, public health, demographics
├── Life itself as object of governance
└── "Make live and let die"
```

**Key Concepts**:
| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Episteme | Historical conditions of knowledge |
| Discourse | System of statements that produces objects |
| Apparatus (dispositif) | Network of power relations |
| Normalization | Making conform to norms |
| Subjectivation | Process of becoming a subject |

### Derrida: Deconstruction

**Against Western Metaphysics**:
- Logocentric: privileging speech over writing
- Metaphysics of presence: privileging presence over absence
- Binary oppositions: hierarchical (speech/writing, nature/culture)

**Deconstruction** (not a method, but a practice):
```
DECONSTRUCTIVE MOVES
════════════════════

1. IDENTIFY BINARY OPPOSITION
   Example: Speech / Writing

2. SHOW HIERARCHY
   Speech: present, immediate, authentic
   Writing: absent, mediated, derivative

3. REVERSE HIERARCHY
   Show that the "inferior" term is:
   - Necessary for the "superior"
   - Present within it

4. DISPLACE OPPOSITION
   Neither term is fundamental
   Both are effects of deeper process
   → "Différance"
```

**Key Concepts**:
| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Différance | Differs AND defers; play of difference |
| Trace | Presence always marked by absence |
| Supplement | Addition that reveals lack in original |
| Logocentrism | Privileging logos, reason, presence |
| Phonocentrism | Privileging speech over writing |
| Under erasure | Writing a word, crossing it out, keeping both |

### Deleuze (& Guattari): Difference and Multiplicity

**Against Representation**:
- Philosophy has subordinated difference to identity
- Difference is primary, not derived from identity
- Thought should affirm difference, multiplicity

**Key Concepts**:
```
DELEUZIAN VOCABULARY
════════════════════

RHIZOME (vs. Tree)
├── No root or center
├── Multiple entry points
├── Connections, not hierarchies
└── Maps, not tracings

DETERRITORIALIZATION / RETERRITORIALIZATION
├── Flows escape coding
├── Capitalism deterritorializes then recodes
└── Lines of flight

ASSEMBLAGE (agencement)
├── Heterogeneous elements working together
├── Neither organism nor mechanism
└── Productive connections

IMMANENCE
├── No transcendent ground
├── Plane of immanence
└── Life as pure immanence

BECOMING
├── Becoming-woman, becoming-animal, becoming-imperceptible
├── Not imitation but entering relations
└── Transformation without fixed endpoints
```

**Three Registers**:
```
LACANIAN REGISTERS
