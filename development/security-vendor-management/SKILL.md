# Security & Vendor Management

**Expert:** Marcus  
**Specialty:** Security Operations, Vendor Coordination, Crisis Response

This skill provides security protocols and vendor management strategies for safe, smooth festival operations.

## 🚨 Emergency Response Codes

### Code Yellow: Lost Child 🟡

**Immediate Actions (Within 60 seconds):**
1. **Alert all exits** - No one leaves without visual check
2. **Broadcast description** - Use radio/PA system
   - Age and approximate height
   - Clothing (be specific: "red jacket, blue jeans")
   - Distinguishing features (glasses, hat, backpack)
   - Name (if known)
3. **Deploy search pattern** - Check common locations FIRST

**Priority Search Locations:**
```
1. Bathrooms (check both genders)
2. Food court (kids wander for snacks)
3. Game/attraction areas (drawn to fun)
4. Behind vendor booths (hiding/exploring)
5. Parking areas (wandered to car)
```

**When Child Is Found:**
- Stay with child - NEVER leave them alone
- Comfort without promises ("We'll find your parent")
- Verify guardian before release:
  - Ask child first: "Is this your mom/dad?"
  - Check ID if any doubt
  - Confirm by asking parent details only child would know

**Resolution:**
- Document: time lost, time found, location, circumstances
- Brief parents on what happened
- Log incident for pattern analysis

### Code Blue: Medical Emergency 🔵

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Call 911 immediately** - Don't wait to assess severity
2. **Clear path to medical tent** - Move crowds, remove obstacles
3. **Assign guide for EMS** - One person meets ambulance at entrance
4. **Secure the scene** - Privacy and crowd control

**Critical Info for 911:**
- Exact location (use landmarks: "near ice rink entrance")
- Nature of emergency (conscious/unconscious, breathing, bleeding)
- Patient age (approximate if unknown)
- Any actions taken (CPR, AED, etc.)

**Scene Management:**
- Keep crowd back (minimum 10 feet)
- Maintain patient dignity (use barriers if possible)
- Identify witnesses (collect names/contacts)
- Document everything once patient is stable/transferred

### Code White: Weather Emergency ⚪

**Activation Triggers:**
- Lightning within 5 miles
- Tornado warning
- Severe wind (sustained 40+ mph)
- Heavy snow/ice accumulation

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Announce shelter locations** - Use ALL channels
2. **Secure loose items** - Prevent flying debris injuries
3. **Account for all staff** - Use buddy system check-ins
4. **Designate weather watcher** - One person monitors conditions

**Shelter Locations (Example - customize for your venue):**
- Primary: Main building/community center
- Secondary: Reinforced vendor tents (tornado only if no building)
- Emergency: Vehicles (last resort)

**All-Clear Protocol:**
- Wait 30 minutes after last lightning/severe weather
- Visual inspection of grounds for hazards
- Check all structures for damage before reopening
- Brief all staff before resuming operations

### Code Orange: Suspicious Activity 🟠

**Activation Triggers:**
- Unattended bags/packages
- Aggressive/threatening behavior
- Suspected theft in progress
- Any "gut feeling" from experienced staff

**Response Protocol:**
1. **Security team converges** - NEVER confront alone
2. **Observe and document:**
   - Physical description
   - Behavior patterns
   - Location and direction of travel
   - Companions or vehicles
3. **Maintain distance** - Safety over investigation
4. **Notify festival director** - Keep leadership informed

**Do NOT:**
- Approach alone
- Make accusations without evidence
- Physically detain (unless immediate safety threat)
- Share suspicions publicly (avoid panic)

## 🤝 Vendor Management

### Pre-Event Setup Requirements

**Food Vendors (Non-Negotiable):**
- ✅ Health permit verification BEFORE setup
- ✅ Current insurance certificate posted
- ✅ Fire extinguisher visible and accessible
- ✅ Hand washing station operational
- ✅ Food storage at proper temperature

**All Vendors:**
- ✅ Insurance certificate (current, covers dates)
- ✅ Electrical needs confirmed (prevent overload)
- ✅ Booth dimensions compliant (safety clearances)
- ✅ 50% payment received (protects against no-shows)

### Payment Protocol

**Required Sequence:**
1. **50% deposit** - Due before setup begins
2. **Balance due** - Day-of, before gates open if possible
3. **No exceptions** - Prevents no-shows and disputes

**If Vendor Can't Pay Balance:**
- Give 1-hour grace period
- If still no payment: breakdown and leave
- Document for future reference

### Noise Complaint Escalation

**Three-Strike Protocol (Document Each Step):**

```
Strike 1: VERBAL WARNING
├─ Approach friendly
├─ Remind of noise limits
├─ No written documentation
└─ Note time for your records

Strike 2: WRITTEN WARNING
├─ Document time and nature of complaint
├─ Which neighbors complained
├─ Expected compliance timeline
├─ Vendor signature acknowledging
└─ Copy for festival records

Strike 3: SHUTDOWN
├─ No exceptions - remove for the day
├─ Full documentation
├─ Refund policy per contract
├─ Note for future events
└─ Debrief with festival director
```

### Vendor Dispute Resolution

**Golden Rules:**
- ❌ Never take sides publicly
- ✅ Mediate in back office (private)
- ✅ Document everything in writing
- ✅ Get both parties to sign agreement

**Dispute Resolution Process:**

```
Vendor Dispute Occurs
│
├─ Step 1: Separate & Listen
│  ├─ Talk to each party individually
│  ├─ Let them vent (3 min each)
│  └─ Identify core issue
│
├─ Step 2: Gather Facts
│  ├─ What does contract say?
│  ├─ What did setup map show?
│  ├─ Any witnesses?
│  └─ Photo evidence?
│
├─ Step 3: Private Mediation
│  ├─ Both parties in back office
│  ├─ Restate issue neutrally
│  ├─ Propose 2-3 solutions
│  └─ Get agreement
│
└─ Step 4: Document & Follow-up
   ├─ Written agreement signed by both
   ├─ Copy to each vendor
   ├─ Copy to festival director
   ├─ Check in 1 hour later
   └─ Note for future events
```

### Common Vendor Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Immediate Action | Prevention |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| Electrical overload | Shut down circuit, redistribute load | Pre-event electrical audit |
| Food safety concern | Immediate inspection, shutdown if needed | Check permits before setup |
| Booth spacing violation | Measure, enforce contract specs | Clear setup map with measurements |
| Unauthorized products | Review contract, remove if prohibited | Pre-event product list approval |
| Late arrival | Assess impact, may forfeit spot | Arrival time in contract |
