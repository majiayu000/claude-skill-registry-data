# Tavily Tools Setup

Run `/tavily-tools:setup` to configure Tavily MCP.

## Quick Fixes

- **API key invalid** - Get new key from app.tavily.com (format: `tvly-...`)
- **Quota exceeded** - Free tier is 1,000 searches/month
- **Connection failed** - Restart Claude Code after config changes

## Don't Need Tavily?

Disable via `/mcp` command to prevent errors.
