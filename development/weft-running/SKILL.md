# Running and debugging

The `weft` CLI is a thin client of [the daemon] plus the front end for
building. [the daemon] is the dispatcher process that owns projects,
executions, triggers, and infra. It listens on `http://127.0.0.1:14111`
unless the user started it on another port, and the port it really runs
on is the `public` field of `~/.local/share/weft/ports.json`.
Every command talks to that one unless it is given `--on <target>`, a cloud
install named in `weft.toml`, which only the `deployer` does (the
`weft-deploying` skill). The user's install (`setup.sh`) starts it, once per
machine.
`weft daemon start`, `stop` and `restart` re-run that install, and a restart
from a project has wiped shared keys before, so you never run them. A `.env`
near the project auto-loads.

Each run is one execution, with its own id (a UUID minted when it starts). Everything in it
is journaled, node by node, with the values on the wires. Every command that
takes an execution id also takes its first characters (`weft events 3f2a`), at
least four, as long as they name a single run.

## How you run a command

Every command you run cannot ask you anything. These are the ones that ask,
with the answer already in them. While you are building, you type them as
they are written here:

| Instead of | type |
|---|---|
| `weft resync` | `weft resync --mode wipe` |
| `weft deactivate` | `weft deactivate --mode wipe` |
| `weft rm`, `weft clean`, `weft prune` | the same with `--yes`, once the user has said yes |
| a long `weft run` | `weft run --detach` |

`--mode wipe` is the answer while you are building; `hibernate` and `park`
are for a program people are using, and the three modes below say when. A
command that asks anyway gets killed and reported with what it asked.

A command that changes the deployed code and the thing you do next go in ONE
line, joined by `&&`: `weft resync --mode wipe && curl ...`. Run them
separately and a resync that failed leaves the next command talking to the
old code, which reads as a bug in what you just wrote.

**You never sit on a quiet command.** If a command can take more than a few
seconds, you start it in the background (a long `weft run` gets
`--detach`), and every wait on it has a cap: the time the table below says
that command normally takes. Inside that cap you still look for movement at
least every thirty seconds: new lines in its output or log, a changed `weft
status --json`, a new line in `weft daemon logs` or `weft infra logs`.
Nothing weft does is silent for thirty seconds when it is healthy, so
silence is the finding. At the cap you look and decide. If it is still
moving, it gets one more expected period at most. If it is quiet or not
moving, it is stuck: you stop it and find out why (`weft daemon logs`,
`weft infra logs`, `weft status --json`). You never just wait longer.

| Command | Normally takes | Your first cap |
|---|---|---|
| Reads: `weft status`, `executions`, `events`, `logs`, `describe-nodes`, `parse`, `validate` | under 5 seconds | 15 seconds |
| `weft run` of a program whose nodes are all built already | a few seconds | 30 seconds; `--detach` for anything that waits on a person, a timer or a long step |
| The first `weft run` or `weft activate` that compiles a node of the project's own | 1 to 3 minutes | 3 minutes, looking every 30 seconds |
| `weft activate`, `resync` or `deactivate` with nothing to build | under 30 seconds | 30 seconds |
| `weft test-node`, basic and fake tiers | 1 to 3 minutes on the first compile, under 30 seconds after | 3 minutes the first time, 30 seconds after |
| `weft infra start` with its image already there | under 1 minute | 1 minute |
| `weft infra start` that builds or pulls an image | 2 to 5 minutes | 5 minutes, looking as it goes |
| A frontend dev server, or `pnpm install` | runs in the background | checked by its port or its log, never waited on in the foreground |

Nothing in weft normally runs for thirty minutes, so a cap of thirty
minutes is always wrong. Check what unit your own tool wants before you
type a number. Some take seconds and some take milliseconds, and getting
it backwards is the difference between thirty seconds and two days.

Getting out is cheap and safe: Ctrl+C on the CLI (nothing weft was doing
is left half done; the daemon finishes or rolls back on its own). Then read
`weft daemon logs`, which is where a wait says what it is waiting on. The
one wait that used to hide here was `activate` sitting behind a worker
from an older build; it no longer waits by default (see `--running-policy`
under the command map), and `weft status` reports an activation still in
flight, which `weft cancel-activate` ends before you run the verb again.
You raise a number only once you can say what is taking the extra time,
and a run that is longer than its shape says is something you report.

If you want to wait on something long (a build, [the daemon] coming up, a run
settling), start it detached and check its state between other steps instead
of writing a loop: `weft run --detach` hands you the execution id, then `weft
executions --json` for a run and `weft status --json` for a build or [the
daemon].

If you do write a loop, it is this line and no other, cap included:

```bash
timeout 30 bash -c 'until <check>; do sleep 5; done'
```

When the cap trips you read the state and say what it is waiting on. A run
parked on a timer or a person never finishes on its own, so an uncapped
`until` on one hangs until somebody kills it, which has happened.

Before you write any loop, say what will make the check true, and check that
it is not you. A loop waiting for the open runs to reach zero while you keep
starting runs never ends. When nothing outside the loop can make the check
true, do not write the loop: do the thing that ends the wait.

**A `pkill` or `pgrep` pattern matches your own command line too.** The
shell running it has the pattern in its arguments, so a broad pattern kills
the shell mid-command: you get an exit code in the 140s, no output, and
nothing saying what happened. Match on the executable instead of a substring
of the whole line (`pkill -x <name>`, or `pgrep -f` on a path that cannot
appear in your own invocation), and prefer the tool that owns the process:
weft's own commands stop what weft started, and [the daemon] is never yours
to kill anyway.

`--json` is a global flag with two meanings. The long commands (`build`,
`bake`, `run`, `activate`, `deactivate`, `resync`, `infra`, `rm`, the
cancels) stream progress as one JSON object per line. The readers (`status`,
`ps`, `executions`, `events`, `logs`, `files`, `token`,
`stop`, `connect`, `tree`, `examples`, `diff`, `checkpoint`, `branch`,
`freeze`, `prune`, `wake`) print what [the daemon] answered, which you read
with `jq` instead of parsing the human columns; `test-node` prints its
reports as one JSON array. `new`, `follow`, `daemon`, `catalog`, `clean` and
`update` ignore it.

## Naming a node

Every command that takes a node takes its whole path from the entry file,
dot-joined, the way the source reads: `classify` for a node written in
`src/main.weft`, `review.classify` for one inside the group `review`,
`triage.classify` for one inside the file the site `triage` includes
(`triage = @include("triage.weft")`), and `triage.review.classify` when it
sits in a group inside that file. Sites, groups and nodes are one tree, and a
name is the walk down it from the top. There is no short form: a bare
`classify` names nothing once the node sits inside a group or an included
file, and the refusal spells the name that works. The same file included
twice is two places with two names (`triage.classify` and `again.classify`),
each with its own runs, waits and display. This is what `--from`, `--emit`,
`--target`, `--before`, `--seed-until`, `--seed-before`, `--group`, `--fire`,
`weft events --node`, `weft wake`, `weft freeze --expect`, `weft infra
node-stop`, `weft infra node-terminate`, `weft infra logs` and `weft token
mint --display` take, and what `weft events`, `weft executions`, `weft infra
status` and the graph print back.

## The command map

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `weft build` | compile, resolve assets, build the worker image (content-addressed) and register the project with [the daemon]. Starts nothing. You never need it while building a program: `weft run`, `weft activate` and `weft resync` build on their own, so running `weft build` before them only builds twice. Its one use is the final deployment, `weft build --referenced`, which ships only the node types the program uses. Also the repair when [the daemon] no longer holds the code a past run ran: registering records the compiled program under its own hash, the one the run names, so unchanged files make the run readable again. Adds nothing to the version tree; `weft checkpoint` does that |
| `weft validate --file src/main.weft < src/main.weft` | strict compile + validate, diagnostics as JSON, nothing runs |
| `weft run [<example>] [--referenced] [--seed] [--root] [--from <node>=<ports-json>]... [--emit <node>=<ports-json>]... [--target <id>]... [--before <id>]... [--group <id>=<ports-json>] [--fire <trigger>=<wake-json>] [--save <name>] [--long]` | build and start one execution; `--detach` returns its execution id. `--long` runs it as a job of its own, which may run for days (a plain run is cut at an hour on a cloud install); a trigger's firings ask for the same with its `longRuns` setting. `--from` supplies backup inputs at a start, `--emit` supplies outputs without executing that node. Real producers take precedence over backups, and under `--seed` the earlier run's result IS a real producer: a `--from` value at a node history already feeds goes unused (the run warns). To hand a new value in, run without `--seed`, or `--emit` the upstream output. `--target` includes the endpoint; `--before` excludes it. `--group` selects a whole group or included file, with its input payload. `--fire` runs exactly one trigger using a matching bake. Ordinary groups can be cut precisely; loops stay whole, and a cut inside one is refused on purpose ("select the whole loop"). If you want to try one node that lives inside a loop, copy it to a scratch spot outside the loop (or a scratch project), run it there with the inputs you want, then put it back. `--seed-before` / `--seed-until` bound compatible reuse. A named example supplies saved starting parameters; current code runs. Clear and replacement rules are in `weft-sdp` |
| `weft checkpoint [<label>]` | record the files as a version under head, no run, no build; `already at <id>` when identical |
| `weft branch <version\|label\|execution-id>` | restore that version's files and move head (a checkpoint label names its version; an execution id makes that run the next seed). Refuses on a dirty tree naming the files; `--discard` overrides |
| `weft tree` | the version tree: versions with what changed, their runs beneath, head marked (`--json` adds `disk_version`) |
| `weft diff <ref> <ref> [--full]` | compare observed outputs for human or AI review, including frozen focus nodes. A ref is an execution id, its unambiguous prefix or `example:<name>`. Differences are evidence and do not fail the command |
| `weft freeze <name> [<run>] [--expect <node>]...` | save that run's starting parameters and observed outputs in `examples/<name>.json`; default is head's run. `--expect` marks nodes to focus on during review. Run and diff leave the accepted file intact; freeze again after accepting its replacement |
| `weft examples` | list saved parameters and frozen examples; inspect them, rerun one with `weft run <name>`, then compare with `weft diff` |
| `weft bake [--referenced]` | prepare trigger inputs without arming listeners. A manual `--fire` requires a matching bake; use `--referenced` here when the run uses `--referenced`. Activation also prepares and records a bake before arming. Takes `--running-policy` like `activate` (the setup runs on a worker, and a stale one is replaced first) |
| `weft wake <execution-id> <node>` | resolve a pure time wait now; refused for a wait expecting a value, naming its kind |
| `weft prune <version>` | delete a version, everything under it, and their runs; asks first, `--yes` for scripts. Refuses on head's version, under a frozen example's origin, and while a run in the subtree is running |
| `weft stop <execution-id>` | cancel an execution |
| `weft workers [set --min-instances N ...\| reset [lever]...]` | the project's own worker levers (copies kept warm, the most copies, runs per copy, CPU, memory); what it leaves unset follows the install, and a change applies at once |
| `weft status` | registration, build state, listener, infra, drift |
| `weft ps` | every registered project |
| `weft executions [--limit N] [--project <id>] [--phase fire]` | past executions, newest first (see Reading a run) |
| `weft events <execution-id> [--node <id>] [--kind <kind>] [--iteration <n>] [--full] [--json]` | a run's events in order, one compact line each (see Reading a run) |
| `weft logs [execution-id]` | a run's log (no argument: the latest execution of the project in the current directory; see Reading a run) |
| `weft follow <project>` | live events for a project |
| `weft activate` / `weft deactivate` | turn triggers on / off. `deactivate` on an active project needs `--mode <wipe\|hibernate\|park>` (a [mode], defined under The three modes). Both take `--running-policy <cancel\|wait>`, default `cancel`: on `activate` it says what happens to a worker still up from an older build (cancel what it runs and replace it now, or `wait` for its executions to land, up to `--drain-timeout` seconds); on `deactivate` the same for the project's running executions |
| `weft resync` | deactivate + activate against a fresh build, after editing a trigger subgraph. Only while some trigger is on, the program's or an instance's (with none on it refuses: `weft activate` first), and it needs the same `--mode` answer as `deactivate`; without it, it stops and asks |
| `weft infra start` / `status` / `stop` / `upgrade` / `terminate` / `cancel` / `logs` / `show` / `press` / `env` | the project's [infra] (see The infra verbs) |
| `weft connect-lib` | copy weft's connect library into the frontend (`front/src/lib/weft-connect`, `--into <dir>` for another folder) so its pages show the editor's connection pickers; the `weft-frontend` skill has when and how. Replaces that folder each run |
| `weft token mint` / `ls` / `revoke` | signal tokens: scoped access for an outside listener such as the browser extension. `mint` prints the connect URL, then the bare token on its own line for a script |
| `weft daemon start` / `status` / `logs` | [the daemon]; only `status` and `logs` are yours |
| `weft catalog update` | re-sync `nodes/base_catalog/` to the installed weft's stdlib |
| `weft options <step> <field> --search <text>` | the choices a field with a searchable list offers (a model id, a spreadsheet), the same list the editor shows, through the step's picked connection; write the id it prints. Before you write such a value as a default (`@instance_filled("...")` included), check it here: nothing else checks it before a run fails |
| `weft describe-nodes --list` | one line per node type; how you find one |
| `weft describe-nodes --node <Type> --compact` | one node's wiring view; read it before wiring. With no flags you get the whole catalog as JSON, which is large |
| `weft test-node <target>` | run node self-tests (`--tier live` spends money, asks first) |
| `weft connect` | the editor's Connect panel as a CLI verb: `--list` the stored connections, `--node <id> --grant <id>` to pick one for a node, connect new accounts through both doors, `--upgrade`, `--forget`, `--disconnect`; `--instance <id>` does the same for one instance of the program on a node whose connection is `@instance_filled`, the way its settings page would |
| `weft instance-values --instance <id> [--set node.field=value]... [--clear node.field]...` | what the program asks that instance to fill and what was given; with `--set` / `--clear`, changes it in one go (its live triggers reading a changed value are set up again). Through an instance token it mints and revokes |
| `weft rm [--journal] [--local] [--all] --yes` | unregister the project, terminate [infra], reclaim data. `--journal` also drops its run history, `--local` its build artifacts, `--all` implies every flag. Asks first; pass `--yes`, and only after the user confirmed |
| `weft clean --yes` | journal and image cleanup, per subject, and naming a subject takes all of it: an execution id takes that one run, `--project <id>` takes a whole project's history (removing a project leaves its runs behind, so this is how you erase them), no subject takes everything older than `--keep-days` (30 by default), `--all` takes the lot. A version the deletion left bare (no runs, nothing under it, no checkpoint name, not head) goes with the runs; a named checkpoint never does. `--images` and `--build-cache` touch no journal rows. Deleting runs asks first; pass `--yes`, and only after the user confirmed |

How a run picks which nodes execute is in the `weft-language` skill. A
trigger fires on its own event only once the project is activated; to try a
trigger's program before activating, `weft bake`, then `weft run --fire
'<trigger>=<wake-json>'` (the `weft-sdp` skill).

## The build and run flow

`weft run` compiles, registers the project with [the daemon], builds the
worker image if sources changed (Cargo runs inside Docker, never on the
host), then fires. Compile failures print `compile failed:` then
`line:column message` lines. HTTP errors surface [the daemon]'s own message
verbatim.

`weft build` skips [the runtime tier] (a connection not yet picked), so a
half-wired program still builds. A run is refused before it starts when a
node it reaches needs a connection nobody picked on this install, naming
each one with the command that picks it (`'slack' has no slack connection
picked on this install; pick one with weft connect --node slack`). `weft
validate --file src/main.weft < src/main.weft` reports the same gaps as
`rule-runtime` findings in seconds, before you run. It also warns about
every catalog folder it left out and why (a broken node folder, say), in its
JSON's `warnings` and on stderr; those never fail validation, so read them
when a node you expected is missing. The fix is a picked
connection (`weft connect --node <id> --grant <id>`, or the user on the
node's Connect button), never a source edit.

A program with triggers listens only after `weft activate`. Each trigger is
turned on and off on its own: `--trigger <name>` on `activate`, `deactivate`,
`resync`, `bake` and the cancel verbs acts on that trigger alone, and without
it they act on every shared trigger. A deactivate drains or cancels only the
runs its triggers fired; a run started by hand is left alone. A program with
instances (the `weft-instances` skill) adds `--instance <id>`: a plain `weft
activate` turns on the shared triggers and names the per-instance ones it
left off. Activating triggers that are already on says so and points at
`weft resync`, which is what a source change needs.

Activate and resync refuse the same way while any connection the program
picks on the install is missing. They also name picks left under an old
address when a node moved (into a group, into another file): `weft connect
--move OLD NEW` moves the install's picks and every instance's values to the
new address.

A build that changed an infra node's image says so: a copy started from then
on gets the new image, and a copy already running keeps its own until `weft
infra upgrade` (`--instance <id>` for one instance's copy). An edit to a
trigger's subgraph takes effect only after `weft resync`, and a plain `weft
resync` brings every trigger that is on up to the new code, each instance's
included. A plain `weft deactivate` leaves instances' triggers on and says whose
are still on; `weft deactivate --all-instances --mode <mode>` takes theirs down.
`weft status --json` lists every trigger with its instance under `activations`;
a trigger being turned on reads `activating` from the moment the activate is
taken, and an instance's trigger holding events until a field is filled carries
`waiting` (`fires` and the `reason` naming the field).

`project files changed while building; run the command again` means a file of
the project was written while the build was reading it, which is almost always
a helper of yours writing into `nodes/` at the same time. Nothing is broken:
run the command again. What matters is that the deployment did NOT change, so
the live program is still the previous one. Anything you call before a resync
succeeds is exercising the OLD code, and results from it tell you nothing
about the edit you just made.

A run that touches
[infra] is refused, from the CLI and from the editor's Run button, until that
[infra] is running: `weft infra status`, then `weft infra start`. Activating
is refused the same way, so on a program with [infra] the very first command
is `weft infra start`, not `weft activate`: it is what builds the node's
images, and nothing else does. That order is the design: `weft activate`
never starts [infra], you start it with `weft infra start` and then activate.
A refusal naming [infra] that is not running is that order being enforced,
not a bug or a gap in weft, so it does not go in a report as friction.

### The three modes

A [mode] is what happens to the runs parked on a person or a timer when the
triggers go down (`deactivate`, `resync` on an active project, the [infra]
verbs that deactivate on the way):

- `wipe`: their forms and timers are dropped and the runs end cancelled. You
  pass it only when nothing is in flight (`weft executions` shows no
  suspended run of the project) or the user said to drop the waiting work.
- `hibernate`: the runs stay alive for a grace window (`--grace <minutes>`,
  15 unless set); a fire arriving inside it is held and delivered when the
  project comes back. Past the window new fires are refused; the waiting runs
  and the project survive (`wipe` is the [mode] that drops them).
- `park`: the runs stay alive with no time limit; every fire is held until
  the project is reactivated. Your pick when the user is editing and people
  are mid-conversation.

**`wipe` is what you pass while you are building.** Nothing waiting on the
program is anyone's conversation yet, so dropping it costs nothing and the
command lands at once. `hibernate` and `park` exist for a program people are
actually using: pass one when the user says so, or when `weft executions`
shows a run parked on a person you would be throwing away.

`--running-policy cancel` (the default) stops the executions already running
now; `wait` lets them finish first, new fires held meanwhile, and you pass
it only when the user asked for the running work to land. A `wait` waits
under `hibernate` and `park` alike (the mode says what happens to the parked
work, the policy what happens to the running work: two separate answers),
and it ends by cancelling whatever is still running at its cap
(`--drain-timeout`, 60 seconds unless set); under `wipe` waiting is refused.
With no `--mode` and no terminal (which is every command you run) the mode
is `wipe`. That is the right answer while you are building, so you rarely
type it; you type `--mode hibernate` or `--mode park` when the program is one
people are using and the work in flight has to survive.

## The infra verbs

[infra] is a container the runtime keeps running for the program (an infra
node: `PostgresDatabase`, `BaileyBridge`), with a disk that survives
restarts. You pick the verb by what you want to keep:

- **If the [infra] is not running yet**, or was stopped: `weft infra start`.
  It brings every unit up to its spec and waits until ready. Running it again
  does nothing for units already up. It leaves activation alone.
- **If you changed an infra node's spec** (image, env, volumes) and want it
  live: `weft infra upgrade`. Each unit whose spec changed goes down and
  comes back on the new spec, the others are left alone, every disk is kept.
  Once the [infra] reports ready, `weft activate`.
- **If you want it off for a while and the data kept** (a paired WhatsApp
  session, a database's rows): `weft infra stop`. The containers go, the
  disks stay, and `weft infra start` brings it back with everything in it.
  Stop and terminate cancel the project's running executions first, because
  they may be using this infra; `--running-policy wait` lets them land
  instead, up to `--drain-timeout` seconds, on an active project and an
  inactive one alike.
- **If you want it gone** (the database and its rows, the bridge and its
  pairing): `weft infra terminate`. Every resource is deleted, disks included
  unless the node's own spec preserves them. There is no undo: a database
  comes back empty on the next start, and a bridge needs its QR scanned
  again. It asks for confirmation on a terminal; from your commands (no
  terminal, or `--json`) it needs `--yes`, which you pass only after the user
  confirmed.
- **If a verb is stuck mid-way**: `weft infra cancel` stops it between
  steps; whatever it already did stays done.
- **If you want to see what an infra node shows**: `weft infra show <node>`.
  A node's card can hold items (a status, an address, a secret) and buttons.
  It prints every item and every button, with the action you hand to `weft
  infra press`, and never prints a secret's value.
- **If something outside the program needs values the [infra] shows** (a
  frontend's database user and password): `weft infra env <node> --into
  <file> --set DATABASE_USER=User --set DATABASE_PASSWORD=Password` writes
  them all into that env file in one go, each `NAME=Label` taking the card
  item under that label as `weft infra show` prints it. `--as <NAME>` is the
  short form for the card's only secret. A new file is readable by the user
  only; an existing one has only those lines changed. A secret's value is
  never printed, the other values are. Nobody edits the file by hand for a
  value the card shows. If the secret is still on the card, that is all you
  need.
- **If the secret was already handed over**, `env` refuses and says what
  the card shows instead. The card usually has a button that issues a new one:
  `weft infra press <node> <action>` presses it (any card button, in fact),
  then run `env` again. A button's warning (`weft infra show` prints it) says what the press breaks
  (a new password cuts off everything holding the old one), so read it, and
  ask the user before pressing a button that breaks something in use, unless
  they already told you to.

`stop`, `terminate` and `upgrade` take down first the triggers that read
the [infra] going away (nothing can fire at it) and leave them deactivated,
so each ends with `weft activate` when you want them listening again. A
trigger that reads none of it keeps listening throughout.

`weft infra status` says per copy that exists whether it is running and its
endpoint; `weft status` lists under `infra:` every infra node the program
declares, one never started as `not started`, so an empty list there means no
node needs [infra]. Every status field (a display's, `InstanceInfraStatus`)
reads `none` for a copy never started or terminated. A start or stop on its way reads `provisioning` or
`stopping` in every reader at once, before the containers move.
On a local install, a unit that asks for a GPU gets every GPU on the machine
(it cannot pick one by kind): `weft infra start`, `upgrade` and `status` warn
about it, and the status JSON carries it in `nodes[].notes`.
`weft infra logs <node>` (or no node, for all) prints what the containers
wrote, `--tail N` and `-f` as for a run: a failure inside a service is read
there.

## Reading a run

Each verb below prints one compact line per run or per event and has a flag
that opens the part you want, so a forty-node run reads without loading the
whole journal. You read in this order and stop when you hold the failing
node and the wrong value.

- **If you want to know what ran, or whether your trigger fired since the
  change**: `weft executions --limit 10 --phase fire`. One line per run:
  execution id, status (`running`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`), phase, the
  local start time, the entry node (the trigger that fired), the tags. An
  activate, a resync or an infra start creates setup runs, phases
  `trigger_setup` and `infra_setup`; `--phase fire` hides them. `--project
  <id>` narrows to one project.
- **If a run failed and you want the reason**: `weft logs <execution-id>`. It
  prints what the run's nodes wrote and every failure the journal recorded,
  as `error` and `warn` lines. A line about one node names it (and the loop
  iteration, `llm#3:`); a line about the run itself (the run failing, a
  cancel) names none:
  `[2026-09-02 21:36:47] error llm: node failed: the service answered 401 ...`. It is
  the last 1000 lines and says so when the run wrote more; `--limit` raises
  that up to 20000, higher is refused. For most failures this is enough and
  you never open the events. `(no logs: ...)` means the run wrote nothing
  and recorded no failure: it did not fail, so you check its status.
- **If you want the values on the wires**: `weft events <execution-id>`. One line
  per event: local time, kind, node, then everything the row carries as
  `key=value`, each cut to a screen's width (`input=` on `node_started`,
  `output=` on `node_completed`, `error=` on `node_failed`, `reason=` on a
  skip or a cancel, `token=` on a suspension, and so on). You narrow before
  you read: `--kind failed` for the failures (a substring matches, so this
  catches `node_failed` and `execution_failed`), `--kind node_skipped` for
  what did not run and why, `--node <id>` for every event on one node,
  `--iteration 3` for the fourth time round a loop (counted from 0; `3.0`
  is the first iteration of a loop inside it, outermost first).
- **If a value on one of those lines is cut off**: it was cut to fit the
  screen, not stored short. `weft events <execution-id> --node <id> --full` prints
  it whole, and `--json` gives you the replay rows for `grep` or `jq`. No
  value a run recorded is unreadable, so you never report one as unreadable.
- **If a node did not run**: its `node_skipped` line carries the reason.
  `did_not_flow`: the node's `_should_flow` said no. `flow_closed`: nothing
  ever answered its `_should_flow`, so walk to whatever drives that wire.
  `required_input_closed` names the input that arrived closed, so walk to
  that node's line. `every_input_closed` and `one_of_group_closed` are the
  same story for a node with no required inputs and for a `@require_one_of`
  group. `scope_skipped` names the group or loop whose `_should_flow` said
  no, taking this node with it: walk to that container. (A group input
  arriving closed is not this: it passes through to the nodes inside that
  read it, and they carry their own reason.)
- **If a `Debug` shows `output=` empty**: correct, a `Debug` has no
  outputs. Its value is on its `node_started` line as `input=`, or `weft
  events <execution-id> --node <debug id>`.
- **If a past run shows no values at all**: a run's rows say what happened,
  not what it meant; the editor works out every input and output by
  replaying those rows against the code the run ran, so a run whose code
  [the daemon] no longer holds shows every node with no values, and the run
  itself says why. The empty graph is not "the node produced nothing" and
  not a viewer bug. The code is kept as long as any run points at it, so
  this is rare. If the files are still on disk, `weft build` puts the
  program back under the hash the run names and the run reads as it did. If
  not, the run is readable only as its shape, and `weft clean <execution-id>`
  removes it.
- In VS Code with the weft extension: the Executions view, "View in Graph"
  replays the run in the graph, values on every wire; `Debug` nodes render
  their latest value inline. For the full editor surface (inspector, action
  bar, targets, everything clickable), go and read the `weft-editor` skill.

## The debugging playbook

1. **It does not compile.** Read the diagnostics: `line:column message`, a
   stable slug, and the message names the fix. You fix what it names; you
   never route around a diagnostic. `weft validate --file src/main.weft <
   src/main.weft` re-checks without building. A diagnostic naming the
   catalog (an enrichment error, an unknown field, "a stale base_catalog
   copy") means the stdlib copy lags the installed weft: `weft catalog
   update`, then re-check, before anything else.
2. **A run failed.** `weft logs <execution-id>` names the node and the error. If
   that is not enough, `weft events <execution-id> --node <that node>` shows the
   values that reached it, on its `node_started` line. For the compiler
   error slugs, go and read the `weft-language` skill. A node's own error
   text is written by the node's author. A node error saying it has no
   connection picked is [the runtime tier] firing at execution,
   not a source bug: you pick a stored connection yourself (`weft connect
   --node <id> --grant <grant>`) or send the user to the node's Connect
   button / `weft connect` in their terminal, then run again. A failure saying
   `the worker running '<node>' went away while it was running` means the
   worker died mid-step: weft never runs a step twice by itself, because the
   step may have partly happened. Check what it did outside (the email, the
   row, the post), then `weft run --seed`, which reuses what completed and
   runs that step again.
3. **A value is wrong, not failed.** Work upstream from the output: open the
   run, look at the top-level groups, find the first whose output is already
   wrong, descend, repeat. When you hold the concrete failing case, iterate
   on that one step (build, run, look) and feed the earlier stages' passing
   examples through again.
4. **Suspended.** Expected for human-in-the-loop: nothing is wrong. A
   suspended run is alive and costs nothing: the `HumanQuery` parks, the
   worker exits, and the answer resumes it. The person answers in the
   browser extension (built with `./setup.sh --browser --no-sign`). If
   nobody should have been asked, the bug is the `_should_flow` that routed
   into the person.
5. **Cancelled.** Read the reason on `execution_cancelled`. `Cancelled by
   user` is a person: the Stop button, `weft stop`, a project deactivate or
   wipe, or a cancel through a signal token. `Stopped by execution <execution-id>
   (tag <tag>)` means another run asked the engine to stop everything
   carrying that tag: look at **that** run, and if no sibling was supposed
   to stop this one, the bug is in whichever node tagged and stopped it
   (`weft executions` shows each run's tags, so you
   see which runs shared it). `Caller disconnected` means the live caller
   this run was answering dropped its connection. Anything else is the
   runtime's own reason, printed as words (a worker shutting down).
6. **Stuck.** The engine proved nothing can proceed; that is a graph-shape
   bug (a wire the compiler could not catch). The `execution_failed` line
   names every firing left holding a pulse and the wired ports it never
   received (`theirs has value, still waiting on go`): walk to whatever
   should have driven the missing port.
7. **Nothing ran.** Nothing reached the branch: check that the trigger that
   should have fired is activated, then walk from it down to the first
   `_should_flow` or required input that closed.
8. **Too much is running.** The one failure nobody reports, because nothing
   errors: runs accumulate and the only symptom is a list that keeps
   growing. Every live connection is its own run for as long as the caller
   holds it, so a page anyone can open, or a client that reconnects by
   itself, can leave one behind per visit. `weft executions` is the check,
   and what you look at is the STANDING count of runs still going, not
   whether the one you started finished. Drive the thing, close it, look
   again: the count comes back down, or you have found a leak. Several runs
   of one trigger that never end is a finding you report, with the count and
   how long they have stood.
9. **A timer or a wake that never arrived.** A wake the receiver refuses
   for good is dropped once, with one error in `weft daemon logs` naming it,
   the status and the answer (on a local install: any `4xx` except `408`
   and `429`; the listener answers a wake it cannot read `200` with
   `dropped` and logs it). A failure that may pass (a `5xx`, `408`, `429`,
   no answer) is sent again later, waiting longer each time. So a wait that
   never woke is read in `weft daemon logs`.
10. **[the daemon] unreachable** (connection refused, an editor button that
   does nothing). You read, never restart: `weft daemon status` and `weft
   daemon logs --tail 50` say what [the daemon] is doing. Then you tell the
   user the symptom (the exact refusal, and what you were running) and stop;
   bringing [the daemon] back is their install's job. If you catch yourself
   typing `weft daemon start`, `stop` or `restart`, stop and write: "Wait.
   The daemon is not mine to restart." Then report the symptom.

## Triggers and public reachability

A trigger is any node carrying `isTrigger: true`, and how it reaches its
events decides what a restart does to it. Three behaviours, and the node's
own description says which one it is only sometimes, so the shapes matter
more than any list of names:

- It POLLS, asking the service what is new. It keeps a cursor, starts from
  activation time, and never replays history (Telegram, Gmail, sheets,
  notion, airtable and RSS all work this way).
- It HOLDS a connection open, or recomputes its next moment on every fire.
  No cursor either way, so anything that happened while it was down is
  gone: `ReceiveEmail` watches over IMAP IDLE, and `Cron` works out its
  next tick from now, so missed ticks do not fire late.
- It waits to be PUSHED at, which needs the runtime reachable from the
  internet. The user opens that with `./setup.sh --public-url`, and the
  trigger's live feed in the graph then shows its real URL. Signal tokens
  (`weft token mint`) scope external listeners like the browser extension.
