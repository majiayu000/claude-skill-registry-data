# Market Signal Tracker Skill

## When to Use
- Monitoring competitor launches, pricing moves, org shifts, funding, or partner announcements.
- Tracking analyst coverage, customer chatter, or social sentiment around competitors.
- Ensuring signals route to the right owners with context and deadlines.

## Framework
1. **Signal Intake** – capture source, timestamp, competitor, category (product, pricing, GTM, talent, regulation).
2. **Severity & Confidence** – rate potential impact, confidence level, and affected product/segment.
3. **Routing** – assign owners (product, enablement, comms, exec) with SLA + follow-up notes.
4. **Action Status** – track planned/active/completed actions linked to each signal.
5. **Reporting** – weekly digest summarizing net-new signals, escalations, and outstanding actions.

## Templates
- Signal log spreadsheet or Notion database with views by competitor/category.
- Weekly digest template with highlights, escalations, and recommended actions.
- Action tracker with owner, due date, and dependency fields.

## Tips
- Automate ingestion by connecting RSS, alerts, and social monitoring; maintain manual overrides for high-sensitivity items.
- Keep a rolling 90-day archive to reference trends and repeat patterns.
- Pair with `analyze-competitive-landscape` and `run-win-loss-program` for holistic perspective.
