# Campaign Planning Skill

## When to Use
- Before launching multi-channel GTM efforts.
- When stakeholder alignment on goals, personas, and offers is needed.
- During quarterly planning or major product launches.

## Framework
1. **Set Objectives** – tie to revenue/pipeline targets, define primary KPIs.
2. **Audience & Offers** – map personas, stages, ICP tiers, and value propositions.
3. **Messaging Architecture** – craft key narrative, proof points, CTA hierarchy.
4. **Channel Mix** – select channels, budget split, cadence, sequencing logic.
5. **Workback Plan** – create timeline with dependencies, approvals, and resource allocation.
6. **Risk Assessment** – identify blockers (legal, creative bandwidth, data access) and mitigations.

## Templates
- **Campaign Brief**: See `templates/campaign_brief.md` for goal, audience, and KPIs.
- **RACI matrix** for decision-making.
- **Timeline Gantt template** with creative/ops milestones.

## Tips
- Host a kickoff with every execution lead to walk through the brief and capture risks live.
- Keep KPIs to one primary and two secondary to avoid diffused focus.
- Bake review/QA milestones into the workback to prevent last-minute rework.
- Maintain a single source-of-truth dashboard so partner teams see timing, assets, and blockers.
