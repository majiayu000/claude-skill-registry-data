<objective>
APEX Methodology drives the full Analyze -> Plan -> Execute -> eLicit -> eXamine workflow for any development task -- new features, bug fixes, refactors, hotfixes. It auto-detects the project type (Laravel, Next.js, React, Swift) and loads the matching framework-specific reference set, then walks through branch creation, brainstorming, codebase analysis, planning, TDD execution, expert self-review (eLicit), functional verification, and sniper validation (eXamine) through to PR creation.

It enforces the project's hard constraints throughout: files under 100 lines (split at 90), interfaces kept out of component files, SOLID principles, and a mandatory sniper pass after every Edit/Write (blocked by PostToolUse hooks until it runs). Three modes control how much is automatic: `--auto` (default, no prompts), `--manual` (step-by-step confirmation), and `--skip-elicit` (bypasses the self-review phase).

**Current Task:** $ARGUMENTS

# APEX Methodology Skill

**Analyze → Plan → Execute → eLicit → eXamine**

Complete development workflow for features, fixes, and refactoring.

---

## Step 0: Initialize Tracking (MANDATORY FIRST ACTION)

**BEFORE anything else**, initialize APEX tracking — see `references/init-tracking.md` for the exact command.

This creates `.claude/apex/task.json` (documentation consultation status) and `.claude/apex/docs/` (consulted documentation summaries). **The PreToolUse hooks will BLOCK Write/Edit until documentation is consulted.**

### Skills Integration

| Phase | Skill | Invocation |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 00.5 | `brainstorming` | Questions → alternatives → design doc → approval |
| 03 | `tdd` | RED (test) → GREEN (code) → REFACTOR cycle |
| 03.7 | `verification` | Re-read request → check criteria → confirm resolution |

## Core Rules

### File Size (ABSOLUTE)

```text
🚨 STOP at 90 lines → Split immediately
❌ NEVER exceed 100 lines
📊 Target: 50-80 lines per file
```

### Interface Location

```text
✅ src/interfaces/     (global)
✅ src/types/          (type definitions)
✅ Contracts/          (PHP/Laravel)
❌ NEVER in component files
```

### Agent Usage

```text
01-analyze:  explore-codebase + research-expert (PARALLEL)
04-validate: sniper (MANDATORY after ANY change)
```

---

## NEVER

```text
❌ Skip explore-codebase or research-expert
❌ Assume API syntax without verification
❌ Create files >100 lines
❌ Put interfaces in component files
❌ Skip sniper after changes
❌ Merge without tests
❌ Large PRs (>400 lines)
```
