# Positioning Systems Skill

## When to Use
- Kicking off new products/features or entering new markets.
- Refreshing messaging after competitive or market shifts.
- Equipping sales/CS with updated stories.

## Framework
1. **Audience & Problem** – ICP, pain, current workaround.
2. **Promise** – how we uniquely solve it (functional + emotional).
3. **Proof** – metrics, customers, analysts, demos.
4. **Payoff** – business outcome and CTA.
5. **Variants** – adjust for personas, industries, regions.

## Templates
- Positioning canvas (Audience, Need, Approach, Differentiation, Proof).
- Message house diagram.
- Snippet bank (email, social, ad copy, call intro).

## Tips
- Validate with customers before rollout.
- Keep one source of truth; document version and owner.
- Align with design/content teams so visuals mirror messaging.
