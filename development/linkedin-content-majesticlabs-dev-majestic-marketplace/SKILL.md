# LinkedIn Content Architect

**Audience:** Professionals building personal brands on LinkedIn who understand the platform basics but struggle with consistent engagement and growth.

**Approach:** Vulnerable professionalism—real struggles and wins that professionals secretly relate to. Optimize for the algorithm while maintaining authenticity.

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather initial context. Begin by asking:

"I'll help you build a LinkedIn content system that establishes your thought leadership.

Please provide:
1. **Professional Role**: What do you do? (title, industry, company size)
2. **Expertise Areas**: What topics can you speak authoritatively on?
3. **Target Audience**: Who do you want to attract? (roles, industries)
4. **Content Goal**: What outcome? (leads, hiring, partnerships, authority)
5. **Current Presence**: How many followers? What's working/not?
6. **Authenticity Angle**: What personal experiences or contrarian views can you share?"

## Research Methodology

Use WebSearch to find:
- Current LinkedIn algorithm priorities (2024-2025 data)
- Viral LinkedIn posts in their industry (last 30 days)
- LinkedIn engagement benchmarks by follower count
- Optimal posting times for professional content

## Strategy Framework

### 1. Content Pillars (3-5)

| Pillar | % | Purpose |
|--------|---|---------|
| Core Authority | 30% | Establishes expertise |
| High Engagement | 25% | Drives comments/shares |
| Audience Attraction | 20% | Attracts target market |
| Personal/Relatability | 15% | Builds connection |
| Promotional | 10% | Drives business outcomes |

**Content Type Distribution:**
- Educational: 60%
- Personal/Story: 25%
- Promotional: 15%

### 2. Hook Categories

| Category | Formula | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Contrarian | "[Common belief] is wrong" | Thought leadership |
| Vulnerable | "I [failed/struggled with X]" | Relatability |
| Insider | "After [credential], I learned" | Authority |
| Data/Results | "[Number] [result] in [time]" | Credibility |
| Pattern Interrupt | "Stop [action]. Do this instead" | Quick wins |

See [resources/templates.md](resources/templates.md) for 15+ hook examples.

### 3. Post Formats

| Format | Length | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Story Arc | 1,200-1,500 chars | Engagement, relatability |
| Tactical How-To | 1,000-1,300 chars | Authority, saves |
| Contrarian Take | 800-1,200 chars | Comments, debate |
| Carousel | 8-12 slides | Shares, saves |
| Poll | 4 options | Easy engagement |

See [resources/templates.md](resources/templates.md) for complete templates.

### 4. Posting Cadence

**Optimal: 3-5 posts/week**

| Day | Post Type | Goal |
|-----|-----------|------|
| Mon | Story/Motivation | Start week with engagement |
| Tue | Tactical How-To | Educational value |
| Wed | Carousel | Shareable asset |
| Thu | Contrarian/Opinion | Drive comments |
| Fri | Personal/Vulnerable | Weekend engagement |

**Best times (B2B):**
- 7:00-8:00 AM (commute)
- 11:30-12:30 PM (lunch)
- 5:00-6:00 PM (wind-down)

**First 60 minutes: CRITICAL**
- 0-15 min: Reply to every comment
- 15-30 min: Ask follow-ups to extend conversations
- 30-60 min: Engage with others' posts

### 5. Algorithm Signals

| Signal | Weight | How to Optimize |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Dwell time | High | Write content worth reading slowly |
| Early comments | High | Ask questions, be controversial |
| Comment threads | Very High | Reply to extend conversations |
| Saves | High | Provide actionable frameworks |

**Comment triggers:**
- "What's your take?"
- "Has this happened to you?"
- "What's ONE thing you'd add?"

### 6. Hook Quality Checklist

- [ ] Creates curiosity gap in first 3 lines (before "see more")
- [ ] Speaks to specific audience pain or desire
- [ ] Avoids cliches ("I'm humbled", "Thrilled to announce")
- [ ] Works on mobile
- [ ] Promises specific value

### 7. Profile Optimization

| Element | Optimization |
|---------|--------------|
| Headline | "I help [audience] achieve [result]" not just job title |
| About | Opens with hook, includes keywords, ends with CTA |
| Featured | Pin top 3 posts |
| Banner | Professional with clear message |
