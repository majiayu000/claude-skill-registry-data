# Rust Development

> **Purpose**: Best practices for Rust development including ownership, error handling, concurrency, and safety patterns.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Building Rust applications and systems
- Working with ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
- Implementing error handling with Result and Option types
- Writing concurrent code with threads and async
- Designing trait-based abstractions

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+ installed via rustup
- Cargo package manager

## Project Structure

### Standard Layout

```
project/
+-- src/
| +-- main.rs # Binary entry point
| +-- lib.rs # Library root
| +-- config.rs # Configuration
| +-- error.rs # Error types
| +-- models/
| | +-- mod.rs
| | -- user.rs
| -- services/
| +-- mod.rs
| -- user_service.rs
+-- tests/
| -- integration_tests.rs
+-- benches/
| -- benchmarks.rs
+-- examples/
| -- basic_usage.rs
+-- Cargo.toml
+-- Cargo.lock
-- README.md
```

### Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "myapp"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
description = "A brief description"

[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
thiserror = "1"
anyhow = "1"

[dev-dependencies]
tokio-test = "0.4"

[profile.release]
lto = true
opt-level = 3
```

## Best Practices

### [PASS] DO

- Use `clippy` for linting: `cargo clippy`
- Format with `rustfmt`: `cargo fmt`
- Prefer `&str` over `String` for function parameters
- Use `#[derive]` for common traits
- Write documentation with `///`
- Use `Result` for recoverable errors
- Leverage the type system for safety

### [FAIL] DON'T

- Use `unwrap()` in production code
- Ignore compiler warnings
- Use `unsafe` without clear justification
- Clone unnecessarily
- Write overly complex lifetimes
- Panic for expected error conditions

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Borrow checker errors | Use .clone() for simple cases, refactor with owned types or Arc<Mutex<T>> |
| Lifetime annotation confusion | Start with owned types, add references only when performance requires it |
| Async runtime errors | Ensure using #[tokio::main] or equivalent, dont mix sync and async without spawn_blocking |
