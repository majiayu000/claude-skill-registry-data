# Product Development Skill

## Core Philosophy

Build products that solve real problems for your audience. Validate before building. Price based on value, not time. Start small, iterate fast.

> "Offering services is a great way to earn revenue and learn what your audience needs and will pay for. Then you can figure out how to create products that decouple your earnings from your time." — Alexis Grant

## Product Ideation Framework

### Identify Opportunities

- What questions get the most engagement?
- What topics generate the most replies?

#### 2. Content Performance
- Which articles/tutorials get most traffic?
- What content gets bookmarked/saved?
- What do people share most?

#### 3. Market Gaps
- What's missing in existing solutions?
- What's too expensive for your audience?
- What's not available in Spanish?

#### 4. Your Expertise
- What do you know deeply?
- What can you teach better than others?
- What's your unique perspective?

### Product Opportunity Matrix

| Factor | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Audience demand | 25% | | |
| Your expertise | 20% | | |
| Market gap | 20% | | |
| Revenue potential | 15% | | |

## Validation Before Building

### Lightweight Validation Methods

#### 1. Pre-sales (Strongest Signal)
- Announce the product before building
- Collect payment (with refund option)
- Build only if threshold met

**Example**:
> "I'm creating a course on [topic]. Early bird price is $49 (regular $99). If 50 people enroll, I'll build it. Full refund if we don't hit the goal."

#### 2. Waitlist with Commitment
- Landing page with email capture
- Ask qualifying questions
- 10% of waitlist typically converts

#### 3. Audience Survey
- Ask about problems, not solutions
- Include willingness-to-pay questions
- Follow up with interested respondents

#### 4. Beta Group
- Offer early access at discount
- Require feedback commitment
- Use to refine product

### Validation Thresholds

| Product Type | Minimum Signal | Green Light |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Course ($100+) | 20 pre-sales | 50+ pre-sales |
| Template ($29) | 50 waitlist | 100+ waitlist |
| eBook ($19) | 100 waitlist | 200+ waitlist |

### Revenue Calculations

```markdown
**Gross Revenue** = Units Sold × Price

**Fees**: Platform (3-10%) + Payment (2.9% + $0.30)

**Break-even Point** = Fixed Costs / (Price - Variable Costs)
**Example**: $2,000 creation cost / ($99 - $12 fees) = 23 sales to break even
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Building Without Validation
❌ Spending months on a product no one wants
✅ Validate with pre-sales or waitlist first

### 2. Underpricing
❌ $19 for a comprehensive course
✅ Price based on value, not hours

### 3. Overcomplicating V1
❌ Perfect production, every feature
✅ MVP that delivers core transformation

### 4. Launching Once and Moving On
❌ One launch, then silence
✅ Evergreen funnel + periodic relaunches

### 5. Ignoring Customer Success
❌ Focus only on new sales
✅ Help existing customers succeed (testimonials, referrals)
