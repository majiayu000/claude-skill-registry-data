To create samples from a prompt, follow this process, using tools provided from the Microsoft Learn MCP Server:

1. Use the `microsoft_code_sample_search` tool to search C# samples from the prompt.
2. Create an sample app using C# 14 and .NET 10.
3. Use the `microsoft_docs_search` tool to search documents about the sample, to write README.md about technical topics for the sample.
