# Personalized Engagement Systems Skill

## When to Use
- Building custom messaging for target accounts or personas.
- Coordinating creative assets across channels (email, ads, social, direct mail).
- Auditing personalization depth per tier to maintain SLAs.

## Framework
1. **Persona & Pain Mapping** – capture value props, proof, objections per stakeholder.
2. **Offer Alignment** – pair offers (executive briefing, POV deck, workshop, custom report) to stage and tier.
3. **Channel Adaptation** – tailor copy lengths, creative specs, CTAs across email, ads, social, events.
4. **Asset Governance** – maintain snippet libraries, approval workflows, localization notes.
5. **Experimentation** – track personalization tests (hook, CTA, asset format) with measurement plan.

## Templates
- **Personalization Tokens**: See `assets/personalization_tokens.json` for dynamic field examples.
- **Persona messaging grid** (pain, proof, CTA, asset reference).
- **Multichannel asset tracker** (status, owner, personalization depth, expiration).
- **Personalization QA checklist** (tokens, data sources, compliance, accessibility).

## Tips
- Reuse modular narrative blocks to scale while keeping customization high.
- Sync with copywriting + design teams early for high-value tiers.
- Monitor engagement vs personalization depth to justify future investments.
