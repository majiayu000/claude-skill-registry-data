# Enablement Messaging Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Creating new sales plays, launch content, or talk tracks.
- Refreshing messaging for competitive shifts or product updates.
- Enabling partners or success teams with consistent narratives.

## Framework
1. **Audience & Pain** – define persona, current pains, and desired state.
2. **Value Pillars** – articulate 2-3 core benefits with supporting proof.
3. **Proof & Stories** – attach metrics, customer quotes, ROI snippets, demos.
4. **Objection Handling** – map common objections to concise responses.
5. **CTA & Next Step** – specify recommended actions (demo, workshop, business case).

## Templates
- Message house worksheet (persona, pain, value, proof, CTA).
- Objection/response matrix.
- Story library index referencing assets.

## Tips
- Tailor variations per segment/industry but keep pillars consistent.
- Partner with product marketing for latest proof points.
- Revisit after every major launch or pricing change.
