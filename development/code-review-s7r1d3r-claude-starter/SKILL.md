- Design patterns and anti-patterns
- SOLID principles
- Clean code principles

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Performing code reviews
- Evaluating pull requests
- Assessing code quality
- Identifying security issues
- Suggesting improvements

## Review Framework

### 1. Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] **Readability**: Clear names, proper formatting, good structure
- [ ] **Maintainability**: DRY, SOLID, low complexity
- [ ] **Performance**: Efficient algorithms, no obvious bottlenecks
- [ ] **Security**: No vulnerabilities, proper validation
- [ ] **Testing**: Adequate test coverage, edge cases handled
- [ ] **Documentation**: Public APIs documented, complex logic explained

### 2. Language-Specific Best Practices

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use const/let, avoid var
- Prefer async/await over callbacks
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Avoid any type
- Handle promise rejections
- Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing

#### Python
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Avoid mutable default arguments
- Use context managers for resources
- List comprehensions where appropriate
- Proper exception handling

#### Rust
- Embrace ownership system
- Avoid unwrap in production
- Use Result and Option properly
- Minimize unsafe code
- Follow clippy suggestions

#### Go
- Follow effective Go guidelines
- Proper error handling (don't ignore errors)
- Use defer for cleanup
- Minimize goroutine leaks
- Proper context usage

### 3. Security Review Checklist

- [ ] Input validation on all user data
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (output encoding)
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks
- [ ] Secure password storage
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Proper error messages (no info leakage)

### 4. Performance Review

- [ ] No N+1 query problems
- [ ] Appropriate data structures
- [ ] Caching where beneficial
- [ ] No unnecessary loops
- [ ] Efficient algorithms
- [ ] Resource cleanup (memory, connections)
- [ ] Lazy loading where appropriate

### 5. Common Anti-Patterns to Flag

- **God Object**: Class doing too much
- **Magic Numbers**: Unexplained constants
- **Copy-Paste Programming**: Duplicated code
- **Shotgun Surgery**: Change requires many small edits
- **Feature Envy**: Method more interested in other class
- **Primitive Obsession**: Overuse of primitives instead of objects
- **Long Method**: Function over 50 lines
- **Long Parameter List**: More than 3-4 parameters
