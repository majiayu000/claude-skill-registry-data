# Intellectual Property Analysis

## Overview

IP law protects creations of the mind through four main mechanisms: patents (inventions), trademarks (brand identifiers), copyrights (creative works), and trade secrets (confidential business information). Each has different requirements, scope, duration, and costs.

## Framework

```
IRON LAW: Match the Protection to the Asset

A brand name is protected by TRADEMARK, not copyright.
Software source code is protected by COPYRIGHT, not patent (usually).
A manufacturing process is protected by PATENT or TRADE SECRET.
Using the wrong mechanism leaves the asset unprotected.
```

### The Four IP Types

| Type | Protects | Requirements | Duration | Registration |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Patent** | Novel, non-obvious, useful inventions | Must be new, inventive, industrially applicable | 20 years from filing | Required (申請制) |
| **Trademark** | Brand names, logos, slogans that identify source | Must be distinctive (not generic/descriptive) | 10 years, renewable indefinitely | Required for full protection |
| **Copyright** | Original creative works (text, code, art, music) | Must be original expression (not ideas or facts) | Life + 50 years (Taiwan) | Automatic (no registration needed) |
| **Trade Secret** | Confidential business information with economic value | Must be secret, have value from secrecy, reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy | Indefinite (as long as secret is kept) | No registration — protect through NDAs and access controls |

### IP Audit Steps

1. **Inventory**: What potentially protectable assets does the organization have?
2. **Classify**: Which IP type fits each asset?
3. **Assess current protection**: Is each asset already protected? How?
4. **Identify gaps**: What's unprotected or under-protected?
5. **Prioritize**: Which assets are most valuable and most at risk?
6. **Recommend**: Registration, contractual protection, or operational security for each asset

### Key Decision: Patent vs Trade Secret

| Factor | Patent | Trade Secret |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Can competitors reverse-engineer it? | Yes → Patent | No → Trade Secret may be better |
| Is independent discovery likely? | Yes → Patent (blocks them) | No → Trade Secret may suffice |
| How long does the advantage last? | < 20 years → Patent | > 20 years → Trade Secret |
| Can you detect infringement? | Yes → Patent is enforceable | No → Patent is hard to enforce |
| Example | Pharmaceutical compound | Coca-Cola recipe |

## IP Asset Inventory
| Asset | Type | Current Protection | Gap | Priority |
|-------|------|-------------------|-----|----------|
| {asset} | Patent/TM/Copyright/TS | {status} | {what's missing} | H/M/L |

## Recommendations
1. {asset}: {recommended action} — {rationale}

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| {IP risk} | H/M/L | H/M/L | {action} |
```

## Examples

### Correct Application
**Scenario:** IP audit for a Taiwanese SaaS startup

| Asset | Type | Protection | Gap |
|-------|------|-----------|-----|
| Brand name "CloudPOS" | Trademark | Not registered | 🔴 Register with TIPO immediately |
| POS algorithm for demand forecasting | Trade Secret or Patent | None | 🔴 Decide patent vs trade secret, implement NDAs |
| Source code | Copyright | Automatic ✓ | 🟡 Ensure employment contracts assign IP to company |
| Customer data processing method | Trade Secret | No access controls | 🔴 Implement access controls + NDA with employees |

Key recommendation: File trademark first (fast, cheap, high risk of name-squatting). Patent decision can wait until product-market fit ✓

### Incorrect Application
- "We'll copyright our brand name" → Brand names are protected by trademark, not copyright. Copyright protects creative expression, not identifiers. Violates Iron Law: match protection to asset.

## Gotchas

- **Ideas are NOT protectable**: Copyright protects expression, not ideas. Patent protects specific implementations. The "idea" for an app is not IP — the specific code, design, or invention is.
- **Employee-created IP**: In Taiwan, IP created by employees during employment generally belongs to the employer (Copyright Act Art. 11, Patent Act Art. 7), but contracts should make this explicit.
- **Open source ≠ no IP**: Open source software has copyright — the license grants permissions, not ownership. Violating license terms is copyright infringement.
- **First-to-file for patents**: Taiwan uses first-to-file (not first-to-invent). If you delay filing, a competitor who files first gets the patent even if you invented it earlier.
- **This is educational guidance, not legal advice**: IP strategy requires consultation with a licensed patent attorney or IP specialist.
