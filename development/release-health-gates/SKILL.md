# Release Health Gates

## Purpose

Standardize release approvals by expressing gates as GitHub-aware checklists. validates code, docs, comms, and observability items are all green before flipping deploy toggles.

## Gate Categories

1. **Scope & Risk** – Are all blocking issues closed or deferred with owners?
2. **Quality Signals** – Are required checks, tests, and soak times satisfied?
3. **Comms & Docs** – Are docs merged and release notes posted?
4. **Operations** – Are runbooks, oncall sign-off, and rollback plans ready?

## Workflow

1. Load skill to access gate modules.
2. Attach Release Gate section to deployment PR.
3. Use tracker data to auto-fill blockers and highlight overdue tasks.
4. Update comment as gates turn green; require approvals for any waivers.

## Outputs

- Release Gate markdown snippet (embed in PR/issue).
- QA Handshake summary referencing GitHub Checks.
- Rollout scorecard that persists in tracker data for retros.

## Exit Criteria

- All release gates evaluated and documented.
- Any blocking gates have waiver approvals recorded.
- Deployment PR contains embedded Release Gate snippet.
- Rollout scorecard saved for post-release retrospective.
