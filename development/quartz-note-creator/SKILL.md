# Quartz Note Creator

This skill helps create properly formatted markdown notes for the Quartz static site generator with correct YAML frontmatter.

## Helper Scripts

This skill includes Python utility scripts for reliable note creation. **Always use these scripts** instead of generating values manually:

- `scripts/timestamp.py` - Generate ISO 8601 timestamps
- `scripts/filename.py` - Generate and validate filenames
- `scripts/frontmatter.py` - Generate complete YAML frontmatter

### Quick Script Usage

```bash
# Get current timestamp
python scripts/timestamp.py

# Generate filename from title
python scripts/filename.py generate "My Note Title"

# Check if file exists
python scripts/filename.py check "my-note-title.md"

# Get today's date filename
python scripts/filename.py date

# Suggest filename with existence check
python scripts/filename.py suggest "My Note Title"

# Generate complete frontmatter
python scripts/frontmatter.py --title "My Note" --tags "ai,ml" --publish true
```

## Instructions

When the user requests to create a new note, follow these steps:

### 1. Generate Unique Filename

**Use the filename.py script for reliable filename generation:**

```bash
# For topic notes
python scripts/filename.py suggest "Note Title"

# For daily journal
python scripts/filename.py date
```

The script will:
- Convert the title to kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- Check if the file already exists in `content/notes/`
- Suggest an alternative name if there's a collision
- Output: `AVAILABLE: filename.md` or `SUGGESTED: filename-2.md`

**Naming conventions:**
- Topic notes: Descriptive kebab-case (e.g., `ai-interpretability.md`)
- Daily journals: Date format `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2026-01-05.md`)

### 2. Generate YAML Frontmatter

**Use the frontmatter.py script for reliable frontmatter generation:**

```bash
# Basic frontmatter
python scripts/frontmatter.py \
  --title "My Note Title" \
  --tags "ai,machine-learning" \
  --publish true

# With description
python scripts/frontmatter.py \
  --title "Daily Journal" \
  --description "Today's work log" \
  --tags "agenda" \
  --publish false
```

**Required fields:**

```yaml
---
title: "Human-readable title"
description: "AI-generated 1-2 sentence description of the note"
author: "Sushant Vema"
date_created: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"
date: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"
publish: true
tags:
  - "tag1"
  - "tag2"
---
```

**Field guidelines:**

- `title`: Clear, descriptive title from user's description
- `description`: **REQUIRED** - Generate a concise 1-2 sentence AI-generated description based on the note title and topic. This should explain what the note is about or what it will cover.
- `author`: Always "Sushant Vema" (handled by script)
- `date_created`: Auto-generated by script (ISO 8601 format)
- `date`: Same as date_created initially (auto-generated)
- `publish`:
  - Default: `true` for most notes
  - Use `false` for "draft", "unpublished", or "private" notes
- `tags`: Extract from user's description
  - Use lowercase for tags
  - Common: "evergreen", "agenda", "AI Agent Architecture", "project"
  - Pass as comma-separated to script: `--tags "ai,ml,research"`

### 3. File Content

**IMPORTANT**: The note file should contain ONLY the YAML frontmatter with no additional body content. Do not add any markdown content, outlines, headers, or placeholder text after the frontmatter closing `---`.

### 4. File Location

Always create files in: `content/notes/`

Full path: `/Users/svema/Repos/github.com/sushantvema/sushantvema.github.io/content/notes/FILENAME.md`

### 5. Verification

After creating the file:
1. Confirm the file was created successfully
2. Show the user the generated filename and path
3. Display the frontmatter that was generated

### Complete Workflow Example

For a user request: "Create a note about AI agent architecture with tags for ai and agents"

```bash
# Step 1: Generate and check filename
FILENAME=$(python scripts/filename.py suggest "AI Agent Architecture")
# Output: AVAILABLE: ai-agent-architecture.md

# Step 2: Generate AI description based on the topic
# Create a concise 1-2 sentence description about what this note covers

# Step 3: Generate frontmatter with the AI-generated description
FRONTMATTER=$(python scripts/frontmatter.py \
  --title "AI Agent Architecture" \
  --description "An exploration of architectural patterns and design principles for building AI agents" \
  --tags "ai,agents,architecture" \
  --publish true)

# Step 4: Get full path
FILEPATH=$(python scripts/filename.py path "ai-agent-architecture.md")
# Output: /Users/svema/Repos/github.com/sushantvema/sushantvema.github.io/content/notes/ai-agent-architecture.md

# Step 5: Create the file using Write tool
# Write ONLY the FRONTMATTER to FILEPATH - no body content
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Topic Note

User request: "Create a note about progressive disclosure in UI design"

Generated file: `content/notes/progressive-disclosure-ui-design.md`

File contents (frontmatter only):
```yaml
---
title: "Progressive Disclosure in UI Design"
description: "Exploring the principle of progressive disclosure and its applications in user interface design, including best practices and implementation strategies"
author: "Sushant Vema"
date_created: "2026-01-05T14:30:00"
date: "2026-01-05T14:30:00"
publish: true
tags:
  - "ui-design"
  - "ux"
  - "progressive-disclosure"
---
```

### Example 2: Daily Journal

User request: "Create today's journal entry"

Generated file: `content/notes/2026-01-05.md`

File contents (frontmatter only):
```yaml
---
title: "Sunday January 5, 2026"
description: "Daily journal entry for tracking tasks, thoughts, and reflections"
author: "Sushant Vema"
date_created: "2026-01-05T09:00:00"
date: "2026-01-05T09:00:00"
publish: false
tags:
  - "agenda"
---
```

### Example 3: Draft Note

User request: "Create a draft note about machine learning model interpretability that I want to keep private"

Generated file: `content/notes/ml-model-interpretability.md`

File contents (frontmatter only):
```yaml
---
title: "Machine Learning Model Interpretability"
description: "Techniques and approaches for understanding and explaining machine learning model decisions and predictions"
author: "Sushant Vema"
date_created: "2026-01-05T16:45:00"
date: "2026-01-05T16:45:00"
publish: false
tags:
  - "machine-learning"
  - "interpretability"
---
```

## Important Notes

- **Always generate an AI description** based on the note title and topic - descriptions are required for all notes
- **Files should contain ONLY frontmatter** - do not add any body content, outlines, headers, or markdown after the closing `---`
- Always use ISO 8601 format for timestamps: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss`
- Use quotes around string values in YAML frontmatter
- Tags should be an array (list with hyphens), not a comma-separated string
- The `publish` field controls whether the note appears on the public site
- Check existing notes in `content/notes/` to avoid filename collisions
- File paths are absolute, starting with `/Users/svema/Repos/github.com/sushantvema/sushantvema.github.io/`

## Common Patterns

**Topic notes**: Use descriptive kebab-case names like `agent-skills.md`, `quartz-wishlist.md`

**Daily journals**: Use date format `YYYY-MM-DD.md` and set `publish: false` by default

**Project notes**: Include "project" in filename or tags, e.g., `ai-profile-summarization-project.md`

**Evergreen content**: Add "evergreen" tag for timeless, continuously updated notes
