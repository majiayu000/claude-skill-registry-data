# Kaizen: Continuous Improvement

Apply continuous improvement mindset - suggest small iterative improvements, error-proof designs, follow established patterns, avoid over-engineering

## Overview

Small improvements, continuously. Error-proof by design. Follow what works. Build only what's needed.

**Core principle:** Many small improvements beat one big change. Prevent errors at design time, not with fixes.

## When to Use

**Invoke explicitly when working on:**

- Code implementation and refactoring
- Architecture and design decisions
- Process and workflow improvements
- Error handling and validation

**Philosophy:** Quality through incremental progress and prevention, not perfection through massive effort.

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)

Small, frequent improvements compound into major gains.

#### Principles

**Incremental over revolutionary:**

- Make smallest viable change that improves quality
- One improvement at a time
- Verify each change before next
- Build momentum through small wins

**Always leave code better:**

- Fix small issues as you encounter them
- Refactor while you work (within scope)
- Update outdated comments
- Remove dead code when you see it

**Iterative refinement:**

- First version: make it work
- Second pass: make it clear
- Third pass: make it efficient
- Don't try all three at once

### 2. Poka-Yoke (Error Proofing)

Design systems that prevent errors at compile/design time, not runtime.

#### Principles

**Make errors impossible:**

- Type system catches mistakes
- Compiler enforces contracts
- Invalid states unrepresentable
- Errors caught early (left of production)

**Design for safety:**

- Fail fast and loudly
- Provide helpful error messages
- Make correct path obvious
- Make incorrect path difficult

**Defense in layers:**

1. Type system (compile time)
2. Validation (runtime, early)
3. Guards (preconditions)
4. Error boundaries (graceful degradation)

### 3. Standardized Work

Follow established patterns. Document what works. Make good practices easy to follow.

#### Principles

**Consistency over cleverness:**
- Follow existing codebase patterns
- Don't reinvent solved problems
- New pattern only if significantly better
- Team agreement on new patterns

**Documentation lives with code:**
- README for setup and architecture
- CLAUDE.md for AI coding conventions
- Comments for "why", not "what"
- Examples for complex patterns

**Automate standards:**
- Linters enforce style
- Type checks enforce contracts
- Tests verify behavior
- CI/CD enforces quality gates

### 4. Just-In-Time (JIT)

Build what's needed now. No more, no less. Avoid premature optimization and over-engineering.

#### Principles

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):**

- Implement only current requirements
- No "just in case" features
- No "we might need this later" code
- Delete speculation

**Simplest thing that works:**

- Start with straightforward solution
- Add complexity only when needed
- Refactor when requirements change
- Don't anticipate future needs

**Optimize when measured:**

- No premature optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Measure impact of changes
- Accept "good enough" performance

**When to add complexity:**
- Current requirement demands it
- Pain points identified through use
- Measured performance issues
- Multiple use cases emerged
