description: "ALWAYS use when the deliverable is a research talk - Typst slides and teleprompter speaker notes built from a paper. Use when the user says \"create workshop slides\", \"build the deck\", \"make slides for my paper\", \"presentation from this paper\", \"write the speaker notes\", \"I'm presenting this at a seminar\", \"turn the paper into a 40-minute talk\", \"I have a workshop next week and nothing to show\", or \"/workshop\". Use proactively whenever a conference, seminar, job talk or brown bag comes up, even if the user never says \"slides\". NEGATIVE ROUTING: course lecture slides and lecture notes are teaching:slides and teaching:notes; grading a deck that is already built is the workshop-reviewer agent; a one-slide tweak on a deck that already exists goes to the workshop agent, since this skill runs a full clarify/plan/dispatch/human-review lifecycle; the paper's own prose is writing-econ or writing-legal."

# workshop — a talk, run through `work` with a computed deck gate

**What this skill carries** — grep `references/` for any subject the names below miss:
!`d=${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}; command -v skill-toc >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec skill-toc "$d"; s=$HOME/.claude/skills/plugin-utils/bin/skill-toc; [ -x "$s" ] && exec "$s" "$d"; echo "(skill-toc unavailable: references and scripts are NOT listed here — install the plugin-utils plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

**The Typst rules in scope for a deck, rendered from the corpus at load time.** Nothing here
lists them; a rule reaches this skill because its own `applies-to:` names a kind a deck is —
`slides`, `notes` or `workshop`. Adding a rule to that scope is an edit to the rule and
nothing else. (Absence of the plugin degrades this index but does not bypass a gate:
`run-constraints.py` fails closed on its own.)

!`k=slides,notes,workshop; command -v typst-rules >/dev/null 2>&1 && exec typst-rules "$k"; r=$HOME/.claude/skills/typst/scripts/load-constraints; [ -x "$r" ] && exec "$r" "$k"; r=$HOME/projects/typst/scripts/load-constraints; [ -x "$r" ] && exec "$r" "$k"; echo "(typst corpus unavailable: NO Typst rule is listed here — a deck graded against no corpus is not a deck that passed. Install the typst plugin, or start a new session so its bin/ reaches PATH)"`

The lifecycle is [`work`](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/work/SKILL.md). Read it and follow it.
This file is a **delta**: it supplies the domain — the CLARIFY axes, the plan grammar, the lens,
the mechanical checks, the refs, the authority text. It ships no `workflow.js` and restates none of
`work`'s mechanics.

What makes a run `workshop` rather than plain `work` is one thing: **the built deck is verified
against the approved plan by a computed probe, not by the agent that generated it.**
`scripts/workshop-deck.py` parses the plan's `## Source Paper`, `## Source Inventory`, `## Slide Spec`
and `## Outputs and Verification`, opens the built artifacts itself, and fails closed on a missing
tool, a missing file, an unreadable PDF or a malformed Slide Spec; `work`'s JS reads its exit code.

## Write surface

Main chat clarifies, plans and dispatches. It does not build the deck, and it **never writes a
`.typ` file** — not by Write/Edit, and not by Bash (`cat >`, a heredoc, `sed -i`, `tee`). Slides and
notes are written by dispatched agents. `work`'s dispatch is already structural and its judges are
pinned to `Explore`, so this is a rule on you, not a hook — reach for the workflow first rather than
after a refusal.

## Phase 1 — CLARIFY

`work`'s Phase 1, on these axes. Ask in one `AskUserQuestion` call where answers are independent;
ask cascading ones separately — the venue decides the duration, and the duration decides the slide
count the Proportions split is drawn from.

| Axis | Establish with the user |
|---|---|
| Paper | The source paper's path, its argument, and which of its results the talk is actually about |
| Audience | Who is in the room, what they already accept, and what they will push back on |
| Venue | Workshop, seminar, job talk or conference; projector scale; whether the paper is pre-read |
| Duration | Talk length, Q&A split, and the hard stop |
| Proportions | The time and slide split across sections — motivation, data, results, implications |
| Visual expectations | Which figures and tables must appear, which are redrawn as diagrams, and what may be text-only |
| Outputs | The deck source, the notes source and their rendered PDFs, by path relative to the project root |
| Review evidence | What makes each section credible at review: a named figure, a quoted statistic, or user judgment |

`work`'s remaining axes are taken as `work` states them, with two domain bindings.

`work` axis 4 (observable success criteria) is answered by the deck probe, the constraint runner and
the probe's own suite. **All three `mechanicalChecks` are fixed strings, and nothing is collected
from the user here.** The one per-run value is the approved plan's path, which `work` already resolved
and hashed in Phase 2; every other argument is literal. `## Outputs and Verification` is an
`Artifact | Path` table of **artifact paths, not commands** — the probe opens those paths itself, so
no cell of it is ever substituted into a `cmd`, and there is no per-project test or lint entry to
collect or omit. Adding a command collected at CLARIFY would change the gate's shape from the one the
plan's Run sizing recorded.

`work` axis 5 (review surface) is answered by the plan's `## Review Surfaces` section.

Gather planning evidence read-only: extract the paper's figures, tables, results and assertions into
the F/T/R/A inventory the plan will declare. Building a slide is not planning evidence.

## Phase 2 — PLAN

`work`'s Phase 2. The plan opens with frontmatter `workflow: workshop` — required, so a context clear
at approval resumes here and not in `work`.

Four domain requirements on the plan:

- **The seven required H2 headings**, spelled exactly, in two classes:
  - **Probe-parsed, FAIL CLOSED when absent, empty or unparseable** — `## Source Paper`,
    `## Source Inventory`, `## Slide Spec`, `## Outputs and Verification`. `workshop-deck.py` parses
    these four and nothing else; a heading spelled differently is an absent heading.
  - **Grammar-required and read by the review lens, not by the probe** — `## Presentation Intent`,
    `## Audience, Venue, Duration, and Proportions`, `## Review Surfaces`. No computed check fires on
    their absence: the lens's CONV item and Phase 5 are what consume them, and a plan
    missing one is not ready for implementation. Do not claim a check here that does not exist.
- **The plan grammar** — the seven-column Slide Spec, the three-column `## Source Inventory`, the
  two-column `## Source Paper`, the four mandatory `## Outputs and Verification` rows, the inventory
  emission the built slides carry, the normalized title key, and the exhaustive
  malformed/unparseable clauses — is specified once, in
  [references/slide-spec-grammar.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/workshop/references/slide-spec-grammar.md).
  Read it in full before drafting the plan.
- **`refs` on every task row and on the lens** — required, may be empty. Write `refs: []` to state "no
  domain rules" rather than omitting the key.

The `Section` column is the task decomposition: one implementation task per distinct `Section`
value, plus one assembler. The assembler reads what the section rows write, so it carries
`dependsOn` naming every section task.

## Phase 3 — GOAL

`work`'s Phase 3 unchanged.

## Phase 4 — the work call

Args, then dispatch **exactly as `work`'s Phase 4 states it** — `work` owns the invocation, the result
handling and the return shape.

Paths below are written the way each consumer reads them: `refs` are absolute, because an implementer
resolves them against no particular directory; `writablePaths` and every `mechanicalChecks` `cmd` are
**project-relative**, because `work` spawns each leg with its working directory at `projectDir`.

```js
{
  projectDir, planPath: "<the path $PLAN resolved to in Phase 2>", planHash: "<64-hex>",
  goal: "<one sentence>",

  // One row per distinct `Section` value in the plan's ## Slide Spec, plus one assembler.
  // Every task carries refs, empty or not.
  // The plan's table verbatim. Every task carries refs, empty or not. The Typst constraints
  // are NOT among them: `implementerAgentType: "workshop"` names `typst:typst` in its own
  // frontmatter, so every doer receives the whole computed index. Listing a subset here was
  // the defect — the comment claimed fifteen modules were unconditional while the rows named
  // four, and the corpus declares 20 for a workshop deck. refs carry task artefacts only.

INV is a per-slide SET EQUALITY between the IDs a built slide emits and its own row's Inventory cell, and it FAILs on a difference in either direction; deck-wide membership in ## Source Inventory is the second half of the check, not the whole of it, so identical boilerplate on every slide FAILs.

Findings: a number, holding or conclusion on a slide that traces to no declared Source Inventory ID or to the paper; a slide overstating what its source supports. CRITICAL where the deck asserts a result the paper does not contain.

A hollow notes bullet (one announcing scenarios, factors or examples the notes never write out), a `#callout` quoting source text and a `// Storytelling:` comment naming no visual mechanism or no insight and a `===` subtitle that is a noun- or gerund-phrase label are NOT on this checklist: Jev's T-HOLLOW, T-CALLOUT, T-STORY and T-TAKEAWAY score them through ruleChecks on the round's changed lines, and a rule in rulesThatFailed is diagnosed and routed like a mechanical failure.

Quote the offending text with a file:line for every finding. Severity across the whole checklist is MAJOR at minimum, CRITICAL where the deck asserts something its source does not support. MODE — RED (a task was flagged or a mechanical check failed): diagnose EVERY failure in the digest and route it, naming cause and fix, to the task id whose writablePaths own the file, or to 'plan' when no task can own the fix.

`implementerAgentType` names `workshop` because the default agent carries Claude Code's
software-engineering system prompt, and the deliverable here is a deck and speaker notes a room
reads — prose, not code. An agent is justified only by a custom prompt, hooks or preloaded skills;
`workshop` earns it on the first, and it preloads `typst:typst`, whose bang line indexes the
canonical Typst modules.

`verifierAgentType` pins `Explore` because it has no Edit and no Write: a judge that structurally
cannot modify the tree beats a prompt asking it not to. The lens buys the same property a different
way — `workshop-reviewer` is read-only by tools allowlist — because Explore's prompt is predefined
and no preloaded skill or CLAUDE.md reaches it, and the lens's constraint item has to be told what it
is grading.

## Phase 5 — HUMAN REVIEW

`work`'s Phase 5 unchanged, over the plan's `## Review Surfaces` — the rendered deck and the rendered
notes. A clean deck gate is evidence for that conversation, not human acceptance.

## Red flags

| Situation | Wrong move | Right move |
|---|---|---|
| A slide's title reads better than the Slide Spec cell | improve it in the deck | SPEC and NOTE join on that cell's normalized key — amend the plan's cell, re-hash, then rebuild |
| A slide's inventory IDs | leave them to a grep over the prose, or emit one boilerplate ID deck-wide because it is declared | prose cannot be joined to an inventory, and membership alone measures nothing — emit exactly that row's `Inventory` cell after the `=== ` line, which `INV` compares as a set in both directions |
| A `mechanicalCheck` needs the project directory | write `<projectDir>/presentation` into the `cmd` | `work` runs the `cmd` verbatim with the working directory at the project root — emit the project-relative `presentation`. A literal placeholder targets a directory of that name, exits 1 on every conforming run, and is a permanently waived check |
| The templates | import them from the skill directory | the probe compiles with `--root` at the project root — the assemble task copies them into `presentation/templates/` and imports project-relative |
| Naming a produced artifact | name it in prose | a runner given prose cannot open it — add its path to `## Outputs and Verification` before approval |
| The deck verdict | let the generating agent report it | the generator cannot see the assumption it made in both places — the probe is a `mechanicalCheck` and the JS reads its exit code |
| `FID`/`CONV`/`VIS` | report them as `PASS` | that presents a judgement as a computation — `MODEL-EVALUATED` with the evidence read |
| A computed check reported clean with no tool installed | accept it | that is the defect this port exists to remove — a missing `typst` or `pypdf` is a FAIL, never a clean line |
| Widows or overflow | add back upstream's runt or overflow checker | both fail open; the probe owns `WID` and `OVR` natively, so those two rules are the probe's, not the corpus runner's |
| A judgement that depends on the Typst modules | dispatch a built-in agent (`Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`) | their prompts are predefined, no preloaded skill reaches them and they skip the CLAUDE.md hierarchy, so the corpus is graded from whatever got read — dispatch a custom agent whose body you control, like `workshop-reviewer` |
| Handing a doer the Typst conventions | name the constraint paths in the task prompt's prose, or copy the modules into a skill | prose is discretionary and a copy is a second source of truth `tests/constraints-no-duplication.test.ts` fails on — put the canonical paths in the task's `refs`, which `work` defines as reads the doer owes in full |
| Section tasks and the assembler | rely on their order in `tasks[]` | the assembler reads what they write — give it `dependsOn` naming every section row |
| Something `work` does not obviously do | write a `workshop/workflow.js` | ask which work parameter is missing — `mechanicalChecks` is what makes the deck probe the gate |
