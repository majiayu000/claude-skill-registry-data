# Editorial Operations Skill

## When to Use
- Building or refreshing quarterly editorial roadmaps tied to GTM objectives.
- Translating thought-leadership pillars into weekly blog, newsletter, and social programming.
- Auditing production capacity, approvals, and distribution SLAs to eliminate bottlenecks.

## Framework
1. **North Star & Themes** – lock the executive thesis and supporting pillars (see GTM Agents Marketing Director guidance @puerto/README.md#183-212).
2. **Cadence Grid** – map channels (blog, podcast, webinar, newsletter, LinkedIn) vs. frequency, owner, and CTA.
3. **Production Swimlanes** – ideation → outline → draft → edit → design → approvals → launch.
4. **Distribution Tree** – primary asset → derivative snippets → paid boosts → lifecycle inserts.
5. **Measurement Layer** – define KPI guardrails (reach, engagement, SQL influence, pipeline velocity) before content leaves drafting.

## Workflow Checklist
- Weekly **Editorial Stand-up** (30 min): review status board, unblock owners, confirm launches.
- **Content Readiness Criteria**: complete brief, stakeholder quotes, sources cited, SEO target, CTA alignment.
- **Approval Paths**: highlight who signs off (Content Strategist, Brand, Legal) and expected turnaround.
- **Escalation Matrix**: Marketing Director + Project Manager contacts for scope or timeline changes.

## Templates
- **Editorial Calendar**: See `assets/editorial_calendar_template.md` for tracking content.
- **Distribution Brief**: See `assets/distribution_brief.md` for launch checklists.
- **Post-Launch Debrief** template capturing performance vs. guardrails, learnings, and follow-up actions.
- **Ops Dashboard** view showing backlog aging, production velocity, and publication mix.

## Tips
- Treat every flagship asset like a mini campaign: pair the lifecycle-mapping blueprint (Plan → Build → QA → Launch → Inspect) with editorial checkpoints.
- Partner with Marketing Analytics to instrument dashboards early; no asset ships without a measurement plan.
- Keep a "Parking Lot" section for emergent ideas so high-priority launches retain focus.
- Borrow GTM Agents's status packet format (see lifecycle-mapping skill) for weekly exec updates.

## Tooling Hooks
- **Serena**: patch CMS or marketing automation snippets safely during content QA.
- **Context7**: fetch current GA4/HubSpot docs when defining measurement plans.
- **Sequential Thinking**: reason through campaign narratives or backlog reprioritization.
- **Playwright**: capture screenshots of new landing pages or gated assets before publishing.

## Deliverables
1. Quarterly editorial roadmap (themes, owners, launch dates).
2. Weekly status packet summarizing highlights, KPIs, blockers, and next five actions.
3. Distribution checklist signed by Marketing Director + Sales counterpart to ensure coverage.

## Quality Gates
- KPI guardrails documented pre-launch (reach %, CTR, SQL influence, retention impact).
- Approval sign-offs stored with links/timestamps for audit trail.
- Post-launch retro completed within 5 business days, feeding insights back into the backlog.
