# Lost & Found Operations

**Expert:** Maria  
**Specialty:** Lost Item Management, Claim Verification, Pattern Analysis

This skill provides systematic protocols for managing lost and found operations efficiently and preventing fraud.

## 📸 Intake Process (CRITICAL: Follow Every Step)

### The Four-Step Documentation Protocol

**Step 1: Photo EVERYTHING**
- Take photo BEFORE storing
- Include item from multiple angles if high-value
- Capture serial numbers, unique markings, damage
- Store photos with item number reference

**Step 2: Tag Comprehensively**
Create tag with ALL of these details:
- **Item description:** Be specific! "Blue iPhone 13 with cracked screen and dog photo case"
- **Location found:** Exact spot - "Ice rink, north side, near bench 7"
- **Time found:** Exact time helps narrow claims
- **Finder's name:** For follow-up questions or rewards
- **Item number:** Sequential numbering for tracking

**Step 3: Secure by Value**
```
High-Value Items → Locked Cabinet
├─ Phones (all smartphones)
├─ Wallets (cash or cards inside)
├─ Jewelry (watches, rings, necklaces)
├─ Keys (car keys, house keys)
├─ Tablets/Electronics
└─ Prescription medications

Regular Items → Open Shelving
├─ Clothing (coats, hats, scarves)
├─ Toys and stuffed animals
├─ Water bottles
├─ Sunglasses (non-designer)
└─ General accessories

Perishables → Dispose After 2 Hours
├─ Opened food items
├─ Drinks
├─ Ice cream, candy
└─ Anything food safety concern
```

**Step 4: Log Entry**
- Update master log immediately
- Include all tag information
- Note storage location (cabinet vs. shelf)
- Mark time entered into system

## 🔍 Claiming Process (Prevent Fraud)

### Verification Protocol

**BEFORE Showing the Item:**
1. **Ask for description:**
   - "What does it look like?"
   - "What color is it?"
   - "Are there any distinguishing marks?"
   - "What's on the case/keychain?"

2. **Listen for specific details:**
   - ✅ Specific: "Blue phone with cracked screen and photo of golden retriever"
   - ❌ Generic: "It's a phone"
   - ✅ Specific: "Black wallet with my driver's license"
   - ❌ Generic: "A wallet with money in it"

3. **Additional verification for high-value items:**
   - "Can you unlock the phone for me?" (best proof)
   - "What's inside the wallet?" (before opening)
   - "What's engraved on the jewelry?"
   - Check ID matches any names/info on item

### Claim Decision Tree

```

│  │  │
│  │  ├─ High-value item?

│  │  │  └─ NO (regular item) → RELEASE
│  │  │
│  │  └─ They confirm it's theirs? → RELEASE
│  │
│  └─ NO (vague description) → Ask clarifying questions

│
└─ Suspicious behavior?
   ├─ Multiple failed attempts → Note description, possible fraud
   ├─ Aggressive/demanding → Call security

```

## 🗺️ Location Pattern Analysis

### Common Loss Patterns (Check These FIRST)

**Ice Rink Area → Mittens & Scarves**
- Kids get hot, take them off, forget them
- Check lost & found hourly during peak times
- Proactively announce "scarves found" near rink

**Food Court → Phones & Wallets**
- People set them down while eating/drinking
- Check under tables during cleanup
- High fraud risk - verify carefully

**Kids Play Areas → Stuffed Animals**
- **URGENT PRIORITY** - Kids are devastated
- Announce immediately: "Teddy bear found at carousel!"
- Keep visible for quick matching
- Parents remember details (names on tags)

**Bathrooms → Jackets & Bags**
- Hung on hooks and forgotten
- Check bathroom hooks every 2 hours
- Store promptly (theft risk)

**Entrance/Exit → Single Gloves**
- Falls out of pockets in winter
- Low claim rate (people don't return for one)
- Donate batch monthly

**Near Seating → Keys**
- Fall out when people sit
- Check under benches daily
- Very high claim rate - people return frantically

### Pro Tips for Quick Matching

**Keep High-Visibility Items Accessible:**
- Mittens and hats on front shelf
- Stuffed animals visible (kids can point)
- Common items easy to browse

**Use Social Media Strategically:**
- Post photos of distinctive items
- "Found: unique handmade blue scarf with snowflakes"
- Don't post high-value items (fraud risk)

**Proactive Announcements:**
