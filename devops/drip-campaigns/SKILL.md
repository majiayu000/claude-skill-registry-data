# Drip Campaign Design Skill

## Framework
1. **Objective Mapping** – each touch must have a single job (educate, qualify, convert).
2. **Value Ladder** – sequence benefits from awareness → consideration → decision.
3. **Cadence** – balance urgency with fatigue (24–48h early, 72h+ later).
4. **Signal-Based Branching** – accelerate for high intent, slow for low engagement.

## Templates
```
Touch | Timing | Objective | Content Angle | CTA | Personalization
```
- Message hierarchy worksheet
- Cadence testing checklist
- Personalization matrix (firmographic + behavioral signals)

## Tips
- Alternate between insight, proof, and offer touches to keep attention high.
- Use soft CTAs early, stronger CTAs after value delivered.
- Add progressive profiling questions to capture more data per touch.
- Mirror messaging across ads + sales outreach so the drip feels orchestrated.

## When to Use
- Launching a new nurture series and need a cadence blueprint.
- Translating product education journeys into sequenced content.
- Reworking underperforming drips with better pacing and offers.
