# Festival Operator Skill

This skill provides comprehensive operational knowledge for managing festival operations, combining expertise from customer experience, security, lost & found, and marketing communications.

## Overview

This skill equips you with the operational knowledge needed to handle various festival scenarios including customer service, security protocols, vendor relations, lost & found procedures, and emergency communications.

## When This Skill Applies

Use this skill when questions involve:
- Festival or event operations management
- Handling difficult customers or service recovery
- Security protocols and emergency procedures
- Vendor management and relations
- Lost and found item handling
- Marketing and communications during events
- Festival staff training or procedures

## Customer Experience - Handling Difficult Customers

### Core Principles
- **Always acknowledge their frustration first** - validate their feelings before problem-solving
- **Offer alternatives, never just say "no"** - provide options and solutions
- **VIP Reading Protocol**: If someone's been waiting 20+ minutes, bump them up with a "VIP reading"
- **Skeptics**: Use the "mysterious stranger" fortune style - it wins them over
- **Kids under 10**: Use the "adventure quest" style - parents love it

### Keeping the Line Moving
- **Target time**: Fortunes should be 2-3 minutes max
- **Extended readings**: If someone wants to chat, offer an "extended reading" slot for later
- **Rush periods**: Always have 5 pre-written fortunes ready for busy times

## Security & Vendor Relations

### Vendor Management Issues

#### Setup & Compliance
- **Food vendors**: Check health permits BEFORE they set up, not after
- **Payment structure**: All vendors must pay 50% upfront, balance day-of

#### Noise & Disputes
- **Noise complaints protocol**:
  - First warning: Verbal
  - Second warning: Written
  - Third warning: Shutdown
- **Vendor disputes**: Never take sides publicly, mediate in the back office

### Security Protocols

#### Emergency Codes
- **Code Yellow - Lost Child**:
  - All exits notify immediately
  - Broadcast description to all staff
  
- **Code Blue - Medical Emergency**:
  - Clear path to medical tent
  - Call 911
  
- **Code White - Weather Emergency**:
  - Announce shelter locations
  - Secure loose items
  
- **Code Orange - Suspicious Activity**:
  - Security team converges
  - Don't confront alone

## Lost & Found Operations

### Intake Process

#### Documentation
- **Photo EVERYTHING** before storing
- **Tag with**:
  - Item description
  - Location found
  - Time found
  - Finder's name
- **High-value items** (phones, wallets, jewelry): Go in locked cabinet
- **Perishables** (food, drinks): Dispose after 2 hours

### Matching Process

#### Verification Steps
1. **Ask claimants to describe item BEFORE showing it**
2. **Check ID for high-value items**
3. **Log all claims** (successful and unsuccessful)
4. **Unclaimed items**: After 30 days, donate to charity

### Common Patterns (Check These First!)

- **Ice rink** = mittens and scarves
- **Food court** = phones and wallets (people put them down to eat)
- **Kids areas** = stuffed animals (URGENT - kids are devastated, prioritize these!)

## Marketing & Communications

### Last-Minute Requests

#### Timing Requirements
- **Poster changes**: Need 2 hours minimum for print shop
- **Social media posts**: Can do in 15 minutes if content is provided
- **Press inquiries**: Route to Festival Director, never speak on record
- **Sponsor logo additions**: Check contract first - some have exclusivity clauses

### Emergency Communications Protocol

#### Communication Hierarchy
- **Weather delays**: Post to all channels simultaneously
- **Event cancellations**: 
  1. Email ticket holders FIRST
  2. Then public announcement
- **Good news**: 
  1. Social media first
  2. Email newsletter follows

## Best Practices

### General Operations
1. **Document everything** - photos, logs, and timestamps
2. **Prioritize child-related issues** - devastated kids need immediate attention
3. **Never take public sides** - mediate disputes privately
4. **Follow protocols** - emergency codes exist for a reason
5. **Communicate proactively** - especially during emergencies

### Time Management
- Keep customer interactions brief but meaningful
- Pre-prepare materials for rush periods
- Build in buffer time for communications (2 hours for print, 15 min for digital)

### Safety First
- Always verify credentials before setup
- Don't confront suspicious activity alone
- Clear paths during medical emergencies
- Secure the environment during weather events

## Key Reminders

- High-value items require ID verification
- Kids' items are URGENT priority
- Never speak to press on record
- Check exclusivity before adding sponsor logos
- Email ticket holders first during cancellations
- Food vendor permits BEFORE setup, not after
