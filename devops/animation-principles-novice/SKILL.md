# Building Your Animation Foundation

You know the basics. Now let's understand how to actually use these 12 principles in your work.

## 1. Squash and Stretch
**What it does:** Gives weight and flexibility to objects.
**Try this:** Animate a bouncing ball. Squash it 20-30% on impact, stretch it slightly at peak velocity.

## 2. Anticipation
**What it does:** Prepares the viewer for action.
**Try this:** Before a character jumps, have them bend their knees. The bigger the anticipation, the bigger the expected action.

## 3. Staging
**What it does:** Directs attention clearly.
**Try this:** Use silhouettes to test your poses. If you can't tell what's happening in shadow, restage it.

## 4. Straight Ahead vs Pose to Pose
**What it does:** Two animation methods with different results.
**Try this:** Use pose-to-pose for planned actions (walks, dialogue). Use straight ahead for wild, organic motion (fire, water).

## 5. Follow Through and Overlapping Action
**What it does:** Creates natural, fluid movement.
**Try this:** After your character stops, let hair, clothes, and appendages continue moving for a few frames.

## 6. Slow In and Slow Out
**What it does:** Adds weight and smoothness.
**Try this:** Add extra frames at the start and end of movements. Fewer frames in the middle means faster motion.

## 7. Arc
**What it does:** Makes movement feel natural.
**Try this:** Track your character's hand through a wave. It should draw a smooth curve, not zigzag.

## 8. Secondary Action
**What it does:** Adds richness without distraction.
**Try this:** A sad character might wipe their eye while talking. It supports the emotion without stealing focus.

## 9. Timing
**What it does:** Controls the mood and physics.
**Try this:** Same action, different frame counts. 4 frames = snappy/light. 12 frames = heavy/deliberate.

## 10. Exaggeration
**What it does:** Pushes reality for effect.
**Try this:** Find the real movement, then push it 20% further. Scared? Eyes wider. Angry? Lean more forward.

## 11. Solid Drawing
**What it does:** Creates believable 3D forms.
**Try this:** Draw your character from multiple angles. Maintain consistent volume throughout.

## 12. Appeal
**What it does:** Makes characters watchable.
**Try this:** Clear shapes, readable expressions, distinctive silhouettes. Avoid symmetry - asymmetry is more interesting.

## Practice Order
Start with: Timing, Squash/Stretch, Anticipation
Then add: Arcs, Follow Through, Slow In/Out
Finally: Secondary Action, Staging, Appeal
