# Philosophy of Mind & Consciousness Skill

Comprehensive framework for analyzing consciousness, mental states, mind-body relations, and the intersection with predictive processing and Free Energy Principle approaches.

## Core Questions

The philosophy of mind addresses humanity's deepest puzzles about the nature of experience:

1. **The Mind-Body Problem**: How do mental and physical relate? What is the metaphysical status of consciousness?
2. **The Hard Problem**: Why is there subjective experience at all? Why does information processing feel like anything?
3. **Intentionality**: How can mental states be *about* things? What gives thoughts their content?
4. **Mental Causation**: How can minds cause physical events? Does consciousness do anything?
5. **Personal Identity**: What makes you the same person over time? What constitutes the self?
6. **The Unity of Consciousness**: How does the brain bind disparate processes into unified experience?

## Major Positions on Mind-Body Relation

### Dualist Positions

| Position | Core Claim | Key Proponents | Challenges |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Substance Dualism** | Mind and body are distinct substances | Descartes | Interaction problem: how does non-physical mind causally affect physical body? |
| **Property Dualism** | Physical substance, but mental properties are non-physical | Chalmers | Epiphenomenalism worry: do mental properties do any causal work? |
| **Interactionist Dualism** | Mind and body causally interact bidirectionally | Eccles, Popper | Violates causal closure of physics? |

### Physicalist Positions

| Position | Core Claim | Key Proponents | Challenges |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Type Identity Theory** | Mental states = brain states (type-type) | Place, Smart | Multiple realizability: pain can be realized in different physical substrates |
| **Token Identity Theory** | Each mental token = some physical token | Davidson | Does this preserve genuine physicalism? |
| **Functionalism** | Mental states defined by causal/functional roles | Putnam, Fodor, Lewis | Absent qualia, inverted qualia objections |
| **Eliminative Materialism** | Folk psychology is false; no beliefs/desires exist | Churchlands | Seems to eliminate the explanandum |
| **Reductive Physicalism** | Consciousness reducible to physical processes | Crick, Koch | Hard problem: reduction seems to leave something out |

### Non-Reductive Positions

| Position | Core Claim | Key Proponents | Challenges |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Anomalous Monism** | Mental is physical but not reducible | Davidson | Is this genuine physicalism? |
| **Emergentism** | Consciousness emerges from but is not reducible to physics | O'Connor, Wong | What is "emergence" exactly? |
| **Panpsychism** | Consciousness is fundamental and ubiquitous | Chalmers, Goff, Strawson | Combination problem: how do micro-experiences combine? |
| **Panprotopsychism** | Proto-experiential properties are fundamental | Chalmers | What are proto-experiential properties? |
| **Russellian Monism** | Consciousness is the intrinsic nature of matter | Russell, Strawson | Can this solve the hard problem? |

### Alternative Frameworks

| Position | Core Claim | Key Proponents | Challenges |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Illusionism** | Qualia don't exist as they seem; consciousness is an illusion | Dennett, Frankish | Who/what is being illuded? |
| **Higher-Order Theories** | Consciousness requires meta-representation | Rosenthal, Carruthers | Infinite regress? |
| **Global Workspace Theory** | Consciousness = global broadcast | Baars, Dehaene | Explains access but not phenomenality? |
| **Integrated Information Theory** | Consciousness = integrated information (phi) | Tononi | Panpsychism implications; how to measure phi? |
| **Predictive Processing** | Consciousness = prediction error minimization | Clark, Hohwy, Seth | Can prediction explain phenomenality? |

## The Hard Problem of Consciousness

### Chalmers' Formulation (1995)

David Chalmers distinguished:

**Easy Problems** (Hard to solve but we know what a solution looks like):
- How does the brain integrate information?
- How does attention work?
- How can we report mental states?
- How does the brain discriminate stimuli?

**The Hard Problem** (We don't even know what a solution would look like):
- *Why is there subjective experience at all?*
- Why does information processing feel like anything?
- Why isn't all this processing done "in the dark"?

### The Explanatory Gap (Levine)

Even if we had complete neuroscience, would we understand *why* those brain states feel like something? There seems to be a gap between physical description and phenomenal experience.

### Response Strategies

| Strategy | Core Move | Proponents |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Type-A Physicalism** | Deny phenomenal consciousness exists (illusionism) | Dennett, Frankish |
| **Type-B Physicalism** | Accept gap is epistemic, not ontological | Papineau, Tye |
| **Type-C Physicalism** | Gap closes with future science | McGinn (mysteriously) |
| **Type-D Dualism** | Accept gap reflects genuine dualism | Chalmers |
| **Type-E Dualism** | Epiphenomenalism: consciousness is causally inert | Jackson (early) |
| **Type-F Monism** | Panpsychism/Russellian monism | Strawson, Goff |

## Key Thought Experiments

### 1. Philosophical Zombies (Chalmers)

**Scenario**: Imagine beings physically identical to us but with no subjective experience—"all dark inside."

**Question**: Are zombies conceivable? If so, what does this show?

**Target**: If zombies are conceivable, consciousness isn't logically entailed by physics → physicalism is false.

**Responses**:
- *Zombies are inconceivable* (Type-A)
- *Conceivability doesn't entail possibility* (Type-B)
- *Zombies are possible; accept property dualism* (Type-D)

### 2. Mary's Room (Jackson)

**Scenario**: Mary knows all physical facts about color vision but has never seen red. When she sees red for the first time, does she learn something new?

**Question**: Does Mary gain new knowledge?

**Target**: If yes, there are non-physical facts about consciousness.

**Responses**:
- *She gains no new knowledge, only new abilities* (ability hypothesis)
- *She gains new knowledge but it's still physical* (phenomenal concepts)
- *She gains genuinely new non-physical knowledge* (accept dualism)

### 3. What Is It Like to Be a Bat? (Nagel)

**Scenario**: Bats experience the world through echolocation. We can study bat brains completely, but can we know what it's *like* to be a bat?

**Question**: Is there something it's like to be a bat that objective science cannot capture?

**Target**: Consciousness has an irreducibly subjective character that objective description misses.

### 4. The Chinese Room (Searle)

**Scenario**: A person in a room manipulates Chinese symbols according to rules without understanding Chinese.

**Question**: Can syntax (computation) ever constitute semantics (understanding)?

**Target**: Strong AI is false—computation alone cannot generate genuine understanding/consciousness.

**Responses**:
- *Systems reply*: The whole system understands
- *Robot reply*: Embodiment is needed
- *Brain simulator reply*: Simulate the brain, not symbols

### 5. Inverted Qualia

**Scenario**: Your "red" experience is my "green" experience, but we both call the same things "red."

**Question**: Is this scenario coherent? Could we ever detect it?

**Target**: Qualia are epiphenomenal and/or private.

For more thought experiments, see `thought_experiments.md`.

## Theories of Consciousness

### Global Workspace Theory (GWT)

**Key Claim**: Consciousness arises when information is "broadcast" globally across the brain.

**Mechanism**:
- Unconscious processors compete for access to global workspace
- "Winning" information is broadcast widely
- This broadcast constitutes conscious access

**Key Proponents**: Bernard Baars, Stanislas Dehaene

**Empirical Support**: Ignition pattern in neuroimaging when stimuli become conscious

**Limitations**: Explains access consciousness but arguably not phenomenality

### Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

**Key Claim**: Consciousness = integrated information (Φ)

**Core Axioms** (from phenomenology):
1. Intrinsic existence
2. Composition
3. Information
4. Integration
5. Exclusion

**Postulates** (for physical substrate):
Each axiom has a corresponding physical requirement.

**Key Innovation**: Consciousness is intrinsic, not functional. A system IS conscious to the degree it integrates information.

**Key Proponent**: Giulio Tononi

**Implications**: Panpsychism (thermostats have tiny Φ); cerebellum is not conscious despite more neurons.

**Challenges**: How to measure Φ? Is the math tractable?

### Higher-Order Theories (HOT)

**Key Claim**: A mental state is conscious when there's a higher-order representation of it.

**Variants**:
- **Higher-Order Thought (HOT)**: Rosenthal—conscious states are those we have thoughts about
- **Higher-Order Perception (HOP)**: Lycan—inner sense perceives first-order states
- **Self-Representationalism**: Kriegel—states represent themselves

**Challenge**: Infinite regress? Does the higher-order state need to be conscious?

### Predictive Processing Framework

**Key Claim**: The brain is a prediction machine. Perception, action, and consciousness emerge from minimizing prediction error.

**Core Architecture**:
```
GENERATIVE MODEL
      ↓
  Predictions
      ↓
COMPARISON ← Sensory Input
      ↓
Prediction Errors
      ↓
Model Update OR Action
```

**Key Concepts**:
- **Generative model**: Brain's hypothesis about causes of sensory signals
- **Prediction error**: Mismatch between prediction and input
- **Precision weighting**: Confidence assigned to errors
- **Active inference**: Action as fulfilling predictions

**Consciousness in PP**:
- *Controlled hallucination* (Seth): Perception is the brain's best guess
- *Counterfactual depth* (Seth): Richness of counterfactual predictions
- *Selfhood as prediction*: Self-model is the brain's model of its own states

**Key Proponents**: Andy Clark, Jakob Hohwy, Anil Seth, Karl Friston

For detailed treatment, see `fep_consciousness.md`.

### Free Energy Principle and Consciousness

**Key Claim**: All self-organizing systems minimize free energy (surprise). Consciousness may be what free energy minimization feels like from the inside.

**Core Equation**:
```
F = E_q[log q(s) - log p(o,s)]
```
Where F is free energy, q is the brain's beliefs, p is the generative model, o is observations, s is hidden states.

**Markov Blankets and Selfhood**:
- A Markov blanket separates internal from external states
- The self just IS the dynamics of maintaining this boundary
- Consciousness arises at the interface

**Key Proponents**: Karl Friston, Thomas Parr, Maxwell Ramstead

## Analysis Protocol

When analyzing a consciousness-related claim, apply this systematic approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Target
What aspect of consciousness is being discussed?
- **Phenomenal consciousness**: What it's like (qualia, subjective character)
- **Access consciousness**: Information available for reasoning/report
- **Self-consciousness**: Awareness of oneself as subject
- **Creature consciousness**: Being conscious vs. unconscious
- **State consciousness**: A particular mental state being conscious

### Step 2: Locate in Debate Space
Which positions does this claim support or oppose?
- Dualist vs. Physicalist implications?
- Reductionist vs. Non-reductionist?
- First-person vs. Third-person methodology?

### Step 3: Apply Thought Experiments
What do the classic thought experiments suggest?
- Does this view survive zombie arguments?
- What does Mary's Room imply for this position?
- Is the view consistent with inverted qualia scenarios?

### Step 4: Consider Empirical Evidence
What does neuroscience/psychology show?
- Neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs)
- Blindsight, split-brain, vegetative states
- Predictive processing findings

### Step 5: Apply FEP/PP Lens
How would predictive processing or FEP analyze this?
- What predictions does consciousness involve?
- What's the Markov blanket structure?
- Is this a precision weighting phenomenon?

### Step 6: Identify Assumptions
What theory of mind is presupposed?
- Does the argument assume physicalism?
- Does it assume representationalism?
- Does it assume a particular view of causation?

### Step 7: Cross-Traditional Check
What would other traditions say?
- Buddhist: Is this assuming a substantial self?
- Phenomenological: Is this respecting the first-person perspective?
- Daoist: Is this over-intellectualizing embodied experience?
