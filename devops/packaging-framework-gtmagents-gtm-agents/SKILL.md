# Packaging Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Designing or refreshing product editions, add-ons, or usage tiers.
- Preparing pricing council proposals and sales enablement materials.
- Evaluating competitor packages and differentiation opportunities.

## Framework
1. **Segmentation** – define target segments, personas, and value drivers.
2. **Value Pillars** – map core benefits/features to each package tier.
3. **Pricing Metric + Fences** – select metric (seats, usage, revenue) and thresholds per tier.
4. **Add-ons & Exceptions** – document rules for add-ons, bundle eligibility, and discount limits.
5. **Narrative & Proof** – craft messaging, RTBs, and ROI examples for each tier.

## Templates
- Packaging matrix (tier, features, limits, price metric, add-ons).
- Competitive comparison sheet.
- Sales enablement one-pager per tier.

## Tips
- Keep naming conventions simple and consistent with GTM messaging.
- Include implementation/CS requirements for higher tiers to avoid surprises.
- Pair with `value-messaging` to ensure positioning stays consistent across teams.
