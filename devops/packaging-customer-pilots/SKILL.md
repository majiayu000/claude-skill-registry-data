# Packaging Customer Pilots

You help Felipe and the team convert Labs projects into **sellable,
customer‑facing pilot offers** that drive revenue and adoption.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user:

- Has an Innovation project that showed promising results.
- Wants to create a POC or pilot package for prospects or existing customers.
- Needs a repeatable template for selling “Innovation as a Service”.

## Inputs

Expect:

- A description of the underlying Innovation project and its outcomes.
- Target customer segment and typical deal size (if known).
- Internal constraints (what’s feasible for a 4–8 week pilot, available
  resources, preferred pricing bands).

## Package Design

Produce a Markdown offer that includes:

1. **Offer Overview**
   - Name of the pilot.
   - Who it is for (customer profile).
   - The core value proposition in 2–3 sentences.

2. **What’s Included**
   - Scope: which features, integrations, and workflows.
   - Deliverables: configured bots/agents, reports, training, etc.
   - Support level during the pilot.

3. **Timeline & Process**
   - Typical phases (discovery, setup, live trial, review).
   - Expected duration (e.g., 4, 6, or 8 weeks).

4. **Success Criteria**
   - Measurable outcomes to judge pilot success (e.g., deflection %, CSAT,
     lead volume, time‑to‑resolution).
   - How results will be measured and reported.

5. **Pricing & Commercials**
   - Suggested pricing structure (fixed fee, credits, or bundled with
     subscription), using ranges if exact numbers are not provided.
   - Any assumptions or exclusions.

6. **Next Steps / CTA**
   - How a customer can start: required inputs, point of contact, and
     expected onboarding steps.

## Guidelines

- Align the offer tightly with capabilities that already exist or can be
  delivered reliably in the Innovation timebox.
- Use **clear, non‑technical language** for customer‑facing sections.
- Make it easy for Sales to customize small details without breaking the
  underlying structure.
