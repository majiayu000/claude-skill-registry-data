## Buddhist Philosophy

### Core Framework: The Four Noble Truths

```
THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS (Cattāri Ariyasaccāni)
═══════════════════════════════════════════

1. DUKKHA (Suffering/Unsatisfactoriness)
   └── Life is pervaded by suffering
   └── Not just pain: also impermanence, incompleteness
   └── Even pleasure is dukkha (it ends)

2. SAMUDAYA (Origin of Suffering)
   └── Craving (tanha) causes suffering
   └── Three types: sensory craving, craving for existence, craving for non-existence
   └── Ignorance (avijja) underlies craving

3. NIRODHA (Cessation of Suffering)
   └── Suffering can end
   └── When craving ceases, suffering ceases
   └── This is nirvana

4. MAGGA (Path to Cessation)
   └── The Eightfold Path
   └── Middle Way between indulgence and asceticism
```

### The Noble Eightfold Path

```
THE EIGHTFOLD PATH (Ariya Atthangika Magga)

└── 5. Right Livelihood (samma ajiva)
        Ethical occupation

MEDITATION (Samadhi)
├── 6. Right Effort (samma vayama)
│       Prevent/abandon unwholesome, develop/maintain wholesome
├── 7. Right Mindfulness (samma sati)

### Key Doctrines

**Three Marks of Existence** (*tilakkhana*):
| Mark | Pali | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| Impermanence | *anicca* | All conditioned things change |
| Suffering | *dukkha* | Attachment to impermanent things causes suffering |
| Non-self | *anatta* | No permanent, unchanging self |

**Dependent Origination** (*paticca samuppada*):
- All phenomena arise in dependence on conditions
- Nothing exists independently
- 12-link chain of causation (ignorance → formations → ... → aging/death)

**Emptiness** (*sunyata*) - Mahayana:
- All phenomena lack inherent existence
- Things exist only in relation to other things
- Nagarjuna: emptiness of emptiness
- Not nihilism: conventional reality remains valid

### Buddhist Philosophy of Mind

**Five Aggregates** (*skandhas*):
1. Form (*rupa*) - Physical body
2. Feeling (*vedana*) - Pleasant, unpleasant, neutral
3. Perception (*sanna*) - Recognition, interpretation
4. Mental formations (*sankhara*) - Volitions, emotions
5. Consciousness (*vinnana*) - Awareness

**The "Self" is a process**: Not a substance but a stream of constantly changing aggregates. No fixed self behind experience.

---

## Daoist Philosophy

### Core Concepts

**Dao (道)** - The Way:
- Ultimate reality; source of all things
- Cannot be named or fully described
- "The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao"
- Both transcendent and immanent

**De (德)** - Virtue/Power:
- The Dao's expression in each thing
- A thing's natural excellence
- Cultivated through non-action

**Wu Wei (無為)** - Non-Action:
- Not inaction but effortless action
- Acting without forcing
- Going with the natural flow
- Water as metaphor: yields yet overcomes

**Yin-Yang (陰陽)**:
```
YIN                         YANG
────                        ────
Dark                        Light
Passive                     Active
Feminine                    Masculine
Yielding                    Firm
Cold                        Hot
Earth                       Heaven
Receptive                   Creative

Key insight: Complementary, not opposed
Each contains the seed of the other
Dynamic balance, not static opposition
```

### Major Texts

**Daodejing** (*Tao Te Ching*) - Laozi:
- ~5,000 characters, 81 chapters
- Poetic, paradoxical, cryptic
- Political and personal wisdom
- "Simplicity, patience, compassion"

**Zhuangzi** (*Chuang Tzu*):
- Stories, dialogues, arguments
- More philosophical, playful
- Skepticism, perspectivism, freedom
- "The fish trap exists because of the fish"

### Daoist Themes

**Naturalness** (*ziran* 自然):
- Things as they naturally are
- Self-so, spontaneous
- Against artificiality and force

**Simplicity** (*pu* 朴):
- Uncarved block
- Return to natural state
- Against complexity and cleverness

**Emptiness** (*xu* 虛):
- Usefulness of the empty
- The hub of the wheel is empty
- Room is valuable because empty

**Reversal**:
- Softness overcomes hardness
- The lowest place receives all waters
- To be full, first be empty
- Paradox as method

### The Butterfly Dream

```
ZHUANGZI'S DREAM
════════════════

Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly,
fluttering happily, unaware he was Zhuangzi.
Upon waking, he wondered:
Am I Zhuangzi who dreamed of being a butterfly,
or a butterfly dreaming of being Zhuangzi?

Interpretations:
1. Skeptical: We cannot know which is real
2. Transformative: Both states equally real
3. Non-dual: No fixed self; all transformations of Dao
4. Phenomenological: Experience precedes identity
```

---

## Confucian Philosophy

- "Do not do to others what you would not want done to you"
- Cultivated through relationships

**Li (禮)** - Ritual Propriety:
- Proper forms of behavior
- Social norms and customs

**Zhi (智)** - Wisdom:

**Xin (信)** - Trustworthiness:

### The Five Relationships

```
FIVE RELATIONSHIPS (五倫 Wulun)
══════════════════════════════

1. Ruler ↔ Subject
   Benevolence / Loyalty

2. Parent ↔ Child
   Kindness / Filial piety

3. Husband ↔ Wife
   Righteousness / Obedience

4. Elder ↔ Younger
   Gentility / Deference

5. Friend ↔ Friend
   Trustworthiness / Trustworthiness

Note: Relationships are reciprocal
      Hierarchy balanced by obligation
```

### The Junzi (君子) - The Exemplary Person

| Studies classics | Literary and historical knowledge |
| Practices ritual | Embodies proper forms |
| Acts with ren | Genuine concern for others |
| Serves society | Takes public responsibility |
| Shows integrity | Inner character matches outer conduct |

**Contrast**: The junzi vs. the xiaoren (小人 small person)

- Xiaoren: focuses on profit

### Neo-Confucianism

**Key Figures**:
- Zhu Xi (1130-1200): Synthesized metaphysics with ethics
- Wang Yangming (1472-1529): Mind as li; innate moral knowledge

**Li (理)** - Principle:
- The rational structure of reality
- Each thing has its li
- Investigation of things reveals li

**Qi (氣)** - Vital Force:
- The material/energetic aspect
- Li shapes qi; qi embodies li
- Human nature: li (good) + qi (can be turbid)

5. MIMAMSA
   └── Ritual interpretation (Vedas)
   └── Philosophy of language

- Liberation: devotion (bhakti) to God

**Dvaita** (Dualist) - Madhva:
- God (Vishnu) distinct from souls and world
- Real plurality
- Liberation: God's grace
- Eternal servitude to God

### Core Hindu Concepts

**Brahman**: Ultimate reality; the absolute
**Atman**: Self; the inner essence
**Maya**: Illusion; cosmic creative power
