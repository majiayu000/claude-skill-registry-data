# Hypr Concierge

Your personal theme concierge for Hyprland/Wayland desktop environments.

## Quick Start

1. Choose or define a theme (see [themes.md](references/themes.md) for presets)
2. Read [app-formats.md](references/app-formats.md) for target application's format
3. Edit config files in `~/dotfiles/{app}/.config/{app}/`
4. Run `cd ~/dotfiles && stow {app}` if new files created
5. Reload each application

## Workflow

### Apply Preset Theme

```
User: "Switch to Catppuccin"
```

1. Read `references/themes.md` → get Catppuccin Mocha colors
2. Read `references/app-formats.md` → get format for each app
3. Edit each config file with theme colors:
   - `~/dotfiles/hypr/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`
   - `~/dotfiles/waybar/.config/waybar/style.css`
   - `~/dotfiles/rofi/.config/rofi/tokyo-night.rasi` (rename file if desired)
   - `~/dotfiles/mako/.config/mako/config`
   - `~/dotfiles/ghostty/.config/ghostty/config`
   - `~/dotfiles/tmux/.tmux.conf`
4. Reload apps: `hyprctl reload && makoctl reload && killall -SIGUSR2 waybar`
5. Suggest Neovim colorscheme plugin if applicable

```
User: "Describe the available themes"
User: "I want something cozy and warm"
User: "What theme feels like a rainy day?"

```
User: "Create a theme inspired by the movie Hackers"
User: "I want a Blade Runner aesthetic"
User: "Make it feel like a forest at night"
```

1. Analyze the inspiration's visual language:
   - What are the dominant colors?
   - What's the mood/atmosphere?
   - What would "error" or "success" look like in that world?
2. Generate a cohesive palette following `references/color-schema.md`
3. Name the theme descriptively
4. Show the user the palette with rationale before applying
5. Save as a custom theme in `~/.config/hyprland-themes/saved/`
