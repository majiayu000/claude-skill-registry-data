## German Idealism

### Kant's Critical Philosophy (Background)

**The Problem**: How is knowledge possible?
- Empiricists: From experience alone
- Rationalists: From reason alone
- Kant: Both are necessary; mind structures experience

**Transcendental Idealism**:
- Space and time: forms of sensibility (how we perceive)
- Categories: forms of understanding (how we think)
- We know phenomena (appearances), not noumena (things-in-themselves)

### Fichte: The Absolute Ego

**Key Move**: Eliminate the thing-in-itself

**The Three Principles**:
1. The Ego posits itself (I = I)
2. The Ego posits the Non-Ego (Not-I) as opposite
3. The Ego and Non-Ego are mutually limited

**Implication**: Reality is the product of absolute consciousness

### Schelling: Philosophy of Nature

**Key Move**: Overcome subject-object dualism

**Nature Philosophy**:
- Nature is not dead matter but living spirit
- Subject and object are identical at the absolute level
- Art reveals this identity (aesthetic intuition)

### Hegel: Absolute Idealism

**The System**:
```
HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY
══════════════════

LOGIC (The Idea in-itself)
├── Being, Nothing, Becoming
├── Categories of thought
└── Dialectical development

PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE (The Idea outside-itself)
├── Mechanics
├── Physics
└── Organics

PHILOSOPHY OF SPIRIT (The Idea returning to itself)
├── Subjective Spirit (individual mind)
├── Objective Spirit (social/political)
│   ├── Law
│   ├── Morality
│   └── Ethical Life (State)
└── Absolute Spirit
    ├── Art
    ├── Religion
    └── Philosophy
```

### The Dialectic

**Structure**:
```
THESIS → ANTITHESIS → SYNTHESIS (Aufhebung)
   │          │            │
   │          │            └── Preserves truth of both
   │          │                Negates one-sidedness
   │          │                Elevates to higher unity
   │          │
   │          └── Negation, opposition
   │
   └── Initial position, one-sided
```

**Aufhebung**: To cancel, preserve, and elevate simultaneously
- The synthesis is not compromise but transcendence
- Contains the truth of both thesis and antithesis
- Becomes new thesis for further development

**Example**: Being and Nothing
1. Being (pure, indeterminate) → Thesis
2. Nothing (equally indeterminate) → Antithesis
3. Becoming (unity of being and nothing) → Synthesis

### Key Hegelian Concepts

| German | English | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Geist | Spirit/Mind | The absolute subject; consciousness in its development |
| Aufhebung | Sublation | Cancel, preserve, elevate |
| An sich | In-itself | Potential, implicit, unrealized |
| Für sich | For-itself | Actual, explicit, self-conscious |
| An-und-für-sich | In-and-for-itself | Fully realized, concrete |
| Vernunft | Reason | Rational comprehension of the whole |
| Wirklichkeit | Actuality | What is rational is actual; what is actual is rational |
| Entfremdung | Alienation | Spirit estranged from itself |
| Sittlichkeit | Ethical life | Concrete social ethics (vs. abstract morality) |

### Master-Slave Dialectic (*Phenomenology of Spirit*)

```
THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION
════════════════════════════

1. Two self-consciousnesses meet
   └── Each seeks recognition from the other

2. Life-and-death struggle
   └── Each risks life to prove freedom

3. One yields (becomes Slave); other dominates (becomes Master)
   └── Master gains recognition but from unfree being

4. Reversal:
   ├── Master: Dependent on slave; stagnates
   └── Slave: Through work, transforms world and self

5. Slave achieves true self-consciousness
   └── Work = objectification of self in world
   └── Fear of death = awareness of own being

6. Path to mutual recognition
   └── Only free beings can truly recognize each other
```

## Reactions Against Hegel

### Kierkegaard: The Individual

**Against Hegel**:
- System cannot contain existence
- Truth is subjectivity
- The individual vs. the universal
- Passion vs. reason

**Three Stages of Existence**:
```
KIERKEGAARD'S STAGES
════════════════════

1. AESTHETIC STAGE
   └── Life of pleasure, variety, immediacy
   └── Don Juan, seducer
   └── Despair: Boredom, emptiness

2. ETHICAL STAGE
   └── Life of duty, commitment, universality
   └── Judge Wilhelm, marriage
   └── Despair: Guilt, inability to fulfill duty

3. RELIGIOUS STAGE
   └── Life of faith, individual relation to God
   └── Abraham, leap of faith
   └── "Teleological suspension of the ethical"
```

**Key Concepts**:
| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Anxiety (*Angst*) | Dizziness of freedom; facing infinite possibility |
| Despair | Being in sin; not willing to be oneself |
| Leap of Faith | Non-rational commitment; choosing without proof |
| Subjectivity | Truth as personal appropriation |
| Repetition | Willing the eternal in the temporal |

### Schopenhauer: The Will

**Metaphysics**:
- Reality is will (blind, striving force)
- Representations are phenomena of will
- Will is irrational, endless desire
- Life is suffering (will can never be satisfied)

**Response**:
1. Aesthetic contemplation (temporary relief)
2. Ethical compassion (recognizing unity of will)
3. Ascetic denial of will (permanent liberation)

**Influence**: Nietzsche, Freud, Buddhism in West

### Nietzsche: Will to Power

**Key Moves**:
- "God is dead" — Collapse of metaphysical foundations
- Critique of morality — "Slave morality" vs. "Master morality"
- Affirmation of life — Despite meaninglessness

**Central Concepts**:
```
NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY
══════════════════════

WILL TO POWER
├── Not political domination
├── Self-overcoming, creativity
├── Life's fundamental drive
└── Basis of all values

ETERNAL RETURN
├── "What if you had to live this life eternally?"
├── Test of affirmation
├── Heaviest thought
└── Amor fati: love of fate

ÜBERMENSCH (Overman)
├── Beyond good and evil
├── Creates own values
├── Affirms life completely
└── Not a biological type

PERSPECTIVISM
├── No "view from nowhere"
├── All interpretation, no facts
├── Multiple perspectives valuable
└── Against dogmatic truth
```

**Master vs. Slave Morality**:
| Master Morality | Slave Morality |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Good = noble, powerful | Good = meek, humble |
| Bad = base, common | Evil = powerful, proud |
| Creates values | Reactive, resentful |
| Affirms self | Denies life |

---

## Phenomenology

### Husserl: Intentionality

**Founding Insight**: Consciousness is always consciousness *of* something

**Method**:
```
PHENOMENOLOGICAL METHOD
═══════════════════════

1. EPOCHÉ (Bracketing)
   └── Suspend natural attitude
   └── Don't assume world exists independently
   └── Focus on how things appear

2. PHENOMENOLOGICAL REDUCTION
   └── Reduce to pure phenomena
   └── Describe structures of consciousness
   └── Eidetic variation: find essences

3. TRANSCENDENTAL ANALYSIS
   └── How consciousness constitutes objects
   └── Noesis (act) / Noema (content)
   └── Intentional structures
```

### Heidegger: Being-in-the-World

**Fundamental Question**: What is the meaning of Being?

**Dasein**: Human existence as the being that questions Being

**Existential Structures**:
```
BEING AND TIME (Sein und Zeit)
══════════════════════════════

BEING-IN-THE-WORLD (In-der-Welt-sein)
├── We are always already in a world
├── Not subject vs. object
└── Holistic, engaged existence

THROWNNESS (Geworfenheit)
├── We find ourselves already in situations
├── Not chosen but given
└── Facticity of existence

PROJECTION (Entwurf)
├── We project possibilities
├── Future-oriented existence
└── Freedom within thrownness

FALLENNESS (Verfallenheit)
├── Absorption in "the They" (das Man)
├── Inauthenticity
└── Fleeing from oneself

ANXIETY (Angst)
├── Not fear of something specific
├── Confrontation with Being-toward-death
└── Reveals authentic existence

BEING-TOWARD-DEATH (Sein-zum-Tode)
├── Death as ownmost possibility
├── Cannot be transferred or avoided
└── Individualizes Dasein

CARE (Sorge)
├── Being-ahead-of-itself (future)
├── Already-being-in (past)
├── Being-alongside (present)
└── Unified structure of Dasein
```

**Authenticity vs. Inauthenticity**:
| Authentic (Eigentlich) | Inauthentic (Uneigentlich) |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Owns existence | Lost in "the They" |
| Faces death | Flees from death |
| Resolute | Dispersed |
| Individual choice | Follows the crowd |

**The Later Heidegger**:
- "The Turn" (*die Kehre*)
- From Dasein to Being itself
- History of Being (Seinsgeschichte)
- Technology as danger and saving power
- Dwelling, poetry, thinking

---

## Existentialism

### Sartre: Radical Freedom

**Fundamental Thesis**: "Existence precedes essence"
- Humans have no predetermined nature
- We create ourselves through choices
- Total freedom = total responsibility

**Key Concepts**:
```
SARTREAN EXISTENTIALISM
═══════════════════════

BEING-IN-ITSELF (En-soi)
├── Non-conscious being
├── Solid, complete, identical with itself
└── "Is what it is"

BEING-FOR-ITSELF (Pour-soi)
├── Conscious being (human)
├── Always beyond itself
├── "Is what it is not, is not what it is"
└── Nothingness, lack, desire

BAD FAITH (Mauvaise foi)
├── Denying freedom
├── Pretending to be a thing
├── "I had no choice"
└── Self-deception

RADICAL FREEDOM
├── We are "condemned to be free"
├── No excuses: situation doesn't determine choice
├── Anguish: awareness of freedom
└── Responsibility: we choose for all humanity

THE LOOK (Le regard)
├── Being seen by another
├── Becomes object for another consciousness
├── Conflict: each wants to possess the other's freedom
└── "Hell is other people"
```

**Being and Nothingness**: Consciousness is nothing but the negation of being-in-itself. Freedom is the heart of being.

### Camus: The Absurd

**The Absurd**:
- Arises from confrontation between human desire for meaning and universe's silence
- Neither in us nor in world, but in their meeting
- "The absurd is born of this confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world"

**Responses to Absurdity**:
1. Suicide — Reject it (wrong answer)
2. Philosophical suicide — Leap to transcendence (bad faith)
3. Revolt — Accept and live with it (authentic response)

**The Myth of Sisyphus**:
- Sisyphus pushing the rock eternally
- "We must imagine Sisyphus happy"
- Revolt, freedom, passion
- Creating meaning despite meaninglessness

### Beauvoir: Situated Freedom

**Contribution**: Freedom is always situated
- Abstract freedom vs. concrete freedom
- Social conditions constrain genuine freedom
- Ethics requires extending freedom to all

**The Second Sex**:
- "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman"
- Critique of woman as "Other"
- Application of existentialism to gender

### Merleau-Ponty: Embodiment

**Contribution**: Critique of Cartesian mind-body dualism
- Body-subject: we are our bodies
- Perception is primary
- Motor intentionality
- Flesh (*chair*): intertwining of subject and world
