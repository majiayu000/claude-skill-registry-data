# Code Quality

Run comprehensive code quality checks: TypeScript typecheck, ESLint linting, Prettier formatting, and Markdown validation.

## Scripts

Scripts are embedded in `skills/code-quality/scripts/finalize.sh`. Agents execute:
- `bash skills/code-quality/scripts/finalize.sh agent` - Auto-fixes formatting issues (agent mode)
- `bash skills/code-quality/scripts/finalize.sh ci` - Read-only checks for CI pipelines (no auto-fixes)

## Checks Performed

1. **TypeScript Type Checking** - Validates type safety
2. **ESLint Linting** - Checks code style and potential issues
3. **Prettier Formatting** - Ensures consistent code formatting
4. **Markdown Quality** - Validates markdown files (trailing whitespace, missing newlines)

## Workflow

### Running Quality Checks

1. **Choose mode**:
   - Agent mode: Execute `bash skills/code-quality/scripts/finalize.sh agent` - Auto-fixes formatting issues while checking for type and lint errors
   - CI mode: Execute `bash skills/code-quality/scripts/finalize.sh ci` - Read-only checks suitable for CI pipelines (no auto-fixes)

2. **Review results**: Check terminal output for errors and warnings
   - TypeScript errors show file paths and line numbers
   - ESLint warnings include rule names and suggestions
   - Prettier issues are auto-fixed in agent mode
   - Markdown issues show file paths and line numbers

3. **Fix issues**: Address any errors that weren't auto-fixed
   - Type errors: Fix type mismatches, missing types, or incorrect imports
   - Lint errors: Follow ESLint suggestions or disable rules with comments if needed
   - Markdown issues: Fix trailing whitespace or add missing newlines

4. **Re-run checks**: Execute the same command again to verify all issues are resolved
   - Script exits with code 0 if all checks pass
   - Script exits with code 1 if any check fails (useful for CI pipelines)

### Integration with Other Skills

- Run after code-review skill to ensure reviewed code meets quality standards
- Run before docs-check skill to ensure code is clean before documentation review
- Use in CI pipelines as a quality gate before merging PRs

## Examples

When agents use this skill, they execute:

```bash
# Agent mode (auto-fixes)
bash skills/code-quality/scripts/finalize.sh agent

# CI mode (read-only)
bash skills/code-quality/scripts/finalize.sh ci
```

## Integration

- Run after code-review skill to ensure reviewed code meets quality standards
- Run before docs-check skill to ensure code is clean before documentation review
- Use in CI pipelines as a quality gate before merging PRs

## References

- `references/documentation-guide.md` - Documentation standards

## Output

Terminal output. Exits with code 0 (pass) or 1 (fail) for CI pipelines.
