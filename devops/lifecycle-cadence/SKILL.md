# Lifecycle Cadence Systems Skill

## When to Use
- Designing new nurture programs or refreshing existing cadences.
- Auditing fatigue, suppression, or timing conflicts across journeys.
- Coordinating MAP and CRM routing for multi-channel touches.

## Framework
1. **Lifecycle Stage Alignment** – ensure cadence matches funnel stage (MQL, SAL, SQL, post-sale).
2. **Trigger Definition** – entry signals (form fills, intent spikes, product milestones, campaign responses).
3. **Pacing Rules** – waiting periods, fallback content, stop logic for engagement or conversions.
4. **Suppression & Priority** – handle conflicting journeys, global caps, sales stages, manual pauses.
5. **Monitoring** – alerts for high unsubscribe/bounce, low engagement, or SLA breaches.

## Templates
- Cadence planner (stage, delay, channel, CTA, exit criteria).
- Suppression matrix (journey priority, conflicts, resolution rules).
- Monitoring checklist (metrics, thresholds, escalation owners).

## Tips
- Reassess cadences quarterly as product/offers evolve.
- Keep a single decision table for suppression rules to avoid MAP drift.
- Align with sales/CS to pause nurtures when opps advance or risks arise.
