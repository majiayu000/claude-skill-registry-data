# Call Brief Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing customer meetings that need clear objectives and roles.
- Enabling managers to inspect upcoming calls before they happen.
- Sharing quick reference docs with supporting teams (SEs, exec sponsors).

## Framework
1. **Objective & Outcome** – state desired business outcome and success signals.
2. **Stakeholders & Roles** – list attendees, personas, and internal owners.
3. **Agenda** – map timeline with talk tracks, demos, and checkpoints.
4. **Key Messages & Proof** – highlight value pillars, metrics, and references.
5. **Risks & Follow-ups** – flag sensitivities, blockers, and immediate next steps.

## Templates
- One-page call brief (objective, agenda, roles, messaging, assets).
- Manager inspection checklist.
- Follow-up log for commitments captured during the meeting.

## Tips
- Keep the brief within a single page to encourage adoption.
- Include a “call scorecard” section so managers can annotate feedback post-call.
- Pair with `persona-intel` for tailored questions and talk tracks.
