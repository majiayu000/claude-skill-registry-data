## Output Format

The skill outputs content in Markdown format with the heading "Exercises & Capstone Checkpoints" containing:
- 3 exercises (mix of conceptual and practical)
- 1 mini project with specific tool usage
- 1 capstone checkpoint connecting to humanoid robotics

## Example Usage

```
skill: "textbook_exercises_generator"
chapter_title: "Introduction to ROS 2"
chapter_summary: "Basic concepts of ROS 2 including nodes, topics, services"
