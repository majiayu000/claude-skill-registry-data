name: Global Conventions
description: Follow truth-first development with focused feature work, accurate spec maintenance, clean version control, environment-based configuration, and infrastructure-as-code deployments. Use this skill when managing requirements, working in branches, handling configuration, reviewing code, maintaining documentation, or deploying with Ansible. Applies to all development activities requiring honest communication, systematic processes, dependency management, and radical transparency in documentation and decision logs.

# Global Conventions

## When to use this skill

- When updating specification documents like `requirements.md`, `spec.md`, or `tasks.md` to reflect reality
- When creating branches, writing commit messages, or preparing code for review
- When managing configuration through environment variables or secrets management systems
- When adding, evaluating, or removing project dependencies with documented justification
- When conducting code reviews focusing on correctness, test coverage, and maintainability
- When maintaining changelogs, release notes, or architectural decision records (ADRs)
- When writing or updating README files that enumerate limitations, trade-offs, and known technical debt
- When creating or running Ansible playbooks for deployments instead of manual shell commands
- When instrumenting code with metrics, logs, and alerts to surface regressions quickly
- When working on one feature at a time without parallelizing implementation without approval
- When communicating system status, risks, or failures without sugar-coating or unverified claims
- When ensuring environment variables and secrets never touch source control
- When practicing fail-loud operations with proper observability and monitoring
