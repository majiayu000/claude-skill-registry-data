# Canary Orchestration

Use this skill to design rollout strategies and guardrails.

## Workflow

1) Define rollout stages, traffic weights, and success thresholds.
2) Select golden signals (latency, error rate, saturation).
3) Execute progressive shift and monitor gates.
4) Roll back on threshold breach and produce a report.

## Output expectations

- Provide a step plan with thresholds and rollback triggers.
