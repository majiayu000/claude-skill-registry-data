# Autonomous DevOps

Use this skill to plan and execute autonomous DevOps control loops.

## Workflow

1) Observe live telemetry (SSE/WebSocket), error rates, and resource trends.
2) Decide remediation vs. scaling (restart, drain, patch limits, or roll out).
3) Apply Kubernetes or Docker control plane actions.
4) Verify via golden signals and rollback if thresholds exceed.
5) Store a post‑incident summary and follow‑up tasks.

## Output expectations

- Provide an action plan with concrete control plane steps.
- Include rollback criteria and verification metrics.
