# api-docs-stinger

Procedural arsenal for `api-docs-wasp-drone`, the Wasp Nest's API documentation specialist. This stinger encodes the tool comparison matrix, the example-authoring discipline, the deployment playbooks for all major hosting targets, the SDK generation pipelines, and the changelog discipline that keeps API consumers informed without breaking them.

## When this stinger applies

Load this stinger when `api-docs-wasp-drone` is invoked. Typical triggers:

- "Set up API docs for this project."
- "Which renderer should I use: Redoc or Scalar?"
- "Deploy my OpenAPI spec to GitHub Pages."
- "Generate a TypeScript SDK from my spec."
- "Write a changelog entry for this breaking API change."
- "Audit our existing API docs."
- "Add examples to every endpoint."

Do NOT load it for:

- Full documentation sites beyond the API reference (route to `library-wasp-drone`).
- OpenAPI security scheme audits (route to `security-wasp-drone`).
- REST/GraphQL route design (route to `python-wasp-drone` or `react-wasp-drone`).
- CI/CD pipeline design for the docs deployment (route to `devops-wasp-drone`; this stinger provides the workflow file template but does not architect the full pipeline).

## First action when this stinger is loaded

Read these in order before doing anything else:

1. **`guides/00-principles.md`**: the spec-first mindset, the five quality gates, when to route elsewhere, and the core invariants.
2. **`guides/01-tool-selection.md`**: the full tool comparison matrix and decision tree. Read this before recommending any renderer.
3. **`research/research-summary.md`**: the intelligence gathered by `scripture-historian` covering Scalar, Redoc, Mintlify, SDK generators, and changelog tooling.

Then walk the remaining guides in task order. Each guide is short; the substantive intelligence comes from the research notes under `research/external/`.

## Tool selection at a glance

| Renderer | Best for | Hosting | Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scalar** | New projects, 2026 default, rich theming, interactive console | Self-hosted, Scalar Cloud | Free / Cloud paid |
| **Redoc** | Enterprise; proven three-panel layout; Redocly platform | Self-hosted, Redocly | Free (OSS) / Pro |
| **Swagger UI** | Widest ecosystem; legacy compatibility | Self-hosted | Free (OSS) |
| **Mintlify** | Managed; beautiful defaults; MDX narrative + reference | Managed only | Paid ($150+/mo) |
| **Stoplight** | Design-first teams; strong mock server; collaboration | Managed | Paid |
| **Bump.sh** | API changelog as primary value; CI diff gate | Managed | Free tier / paid |

**2026 default recommendation:** Scalar for new greenfield projects. See `guides/01-tool-selection.md` for the full decision tree.

## SDK generation at a glance

| Tool | Quality | Languages | Price | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **openapi-generator-cli** | Good (v7+) | 50+ | Free | Best for Go; Python quality improved |
| **Fern** | Excellent | TS, Python, Go, Java | Free OSS; $250/SDK/mo cloud | Acquired by Postman Jan 2026 |
| **Speakeasy** | Excellent | TS, Python, Go, Java | Free tier; paid | Strong TypeScript quality |

See `guides/04-sdk-generation.md` for generation commands and Makefile targets.

## Critical directives (lifted from the Command Brief)

These are non-negotiables. Full justification in `guides/00-principles.md`.

- **Start with the OpenAPI spec, not the tool.** Renderer choice is secondary to spec completeness.
- **Never recommend a tool without citing concrete trade-offs.** Use the comparison matrix in `guides/01-tool-selection.md`.
- **Enrich examples before publishing.** Every endpoint needs at least one JSON request example and one response example.
- **Break changes must be flagged `[BREAKING]` in the changelog.** No exception.
- **Self-hosted setups must include a one-command rebuild.** `make docs`, `just docs`, or a `package.json` script.
- **Do not scope-creep into general product docs.** Route to `library-wasp-drone` when docs exceed the API reference.
