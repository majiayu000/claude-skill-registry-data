# Social Performance Metrics Skill

## When to Use
- Setting KPI targets for new campaigns or evergreen programs.
- Building dashboards or scorecards for exec/stakeholder updates.
- Diagnosing pacing, reach, or conversion issues mid-flight.

## Framework
1. **Metric Stack** – map awareness (reach, impressions), engagement (ER, saves, shares), conversion (traffic, pipeline), and community health (sentiment, response time).
2. **Attribution & Tagging** – enforce UTM structure, post IDs, and partner tags for downstream analysis.
3. **Alerting Rules** – define thresholds (± variance vs goal), alert channels, and severity tiers.
4. **Reporting Cadence** – daily pacing snapshots, weekly recaps, campaign retros, quarterly trendlines.
5. **Experiment Measurement** – document test KPIs, guardrails, and success decision trees.

## Templates
- KPI scorecard (metric → target → actual → variance → owner → notes).
- Alert playbook (trigger condition → notification → response steps).
- Retro template summarizing learnings, insights, and backlog actions.

## Tips
- Normalize metrics per channel and audience to avoid false comparisons.
- Pair with analytics warehouse data for revenue-attribution context.
- Keep metadata consistent (pillar, campaign, creative ID) so insights are reusable.
