# Commit Message Generator

Automatically generate conventional commit messages for staged changes.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user:
- Mentions "commit", "committing", "staged changes", or "ready to commit"
- Shows `git add` or `git status` output with staged changes
- Asks "what should my commit message be?"
- Says "I need to commit my changes"
- Asks for help writing commit messages

## Workflow

### 1. Check for Staged Changes

```bash
git status
git diff --staged
```

If no staged changes, inform the user and suggest staging files first.

### 2. Analyze Recent Commits for Style

```bash
git log --oneline -10
```

Learn the repository's commit message conventions.

### 3. Generate Conventional Commit Message

**Format**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Types**:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Build process, dependency updates, etc.
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `ci` - CI/CD changes

**Example**:
```
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication support

- Implement TOTP-based 2FA
- Add backup codes generation
- Include recovery flow for lost devices
- Update user profile settings UI
```

### 4. Drupal/WordPress-Specific Patterns

**Drupal**:
- Config changes: `feat(config): add user profile field configuration`
- Module work: `fix(custom_module): correct permission check in access callback`
- Hooks: `refactor(hooks): simplify hook_form_alter implementation`

**WordPress**:
- Theme work: `style(theme): improve mobile navigation styles`
- Plugin work: `fix(plugin): correct ACF field validation`
- Blocks: `feat(blocks): add testimonial Gutenberg block`

### 5. Present to User for Approval

**When used via workflow-specialist agent:**
The agent will use `AskUserQuestion` to present the commit message for review:
- Show the generated message
- Ask: "Would you like to proceed with this commit message, or would you like to edit it?"
- Options: "Approve and commit" or "Edit message"
- If user selects "Other", they can provide their edited version

**When used conversationally:**
Show the generated commit message and ask:
"Here's a commit message based on your changes. Would you like me to commit with this message, or would you like to modify it?"

### 6. Execute Commit (only after approval)

```bash
git commit -m "commit message here"
```

Or for multi-line messages:
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication support

- Implement TOTP-based 2FA
- Add backup codes generation
- Include recovery flow
EOF
)"
```

## Integration with CMS Cultivator

This skill complements the `/pr-commit-msg` slash command:

- **This Skill**: Automatically triggered during natural conversation
  - "I'm ready to commit"
  - "What should my commit message say?"

- **`/pr-commit-msg` Command**: Explicitly invoked for staged changes
  - User deliberately wants commit message generation
  - Batch generation workflow

Both use the same analysis approach but different invocation methods.

## Best Practices

1. **Analyze the actual changes** - Don't just use file names, understand what changed
2. **Be specific in scope** - Use module name, component name, or feature area
3. **Include breaking changes** - Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer if applicable
4. **Reference tickets** - Include ticket numbers if found in branch name
5. **Follow project conventions** - Match the existing commit style

## Example Interactions

**Example 1: Simple fix**
```
User: "I fixed the login bug, ready to commit"
[Skill analyzes git diff]
Skill: "I'll generate a commit message for your login fix..."

Generated:
fix(auth): resolve session timeout on remember-me login

- Correct cookie expiration logic
- Add test coverage for remember-me flow

Would you like me to commit with this message?
```

**Example 2: Feature addition**
```
User: "Staged my changes, need to commit"
[Skill analyzes extensive changes]
Skill: "I see you've added a new dashboard widget. Here's a commit message..."

Generated:
feat(dashboard): add performance metrics widget

- Create new widget component
- Add database query for metrics
- Include responsive design
- Add widget to admin dashboard page
```
