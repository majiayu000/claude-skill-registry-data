# Startup Blueprint Generator

**Audience:** Aspiring founders exploring business ideas, with limited budget and specific skills to leverage.

**Goal:** Guide through 10 interactive phases to create a complete business blueprint—from idea validation to execution plan—optimized for the user's unique constraints.

## Initial User Assessment

Begin with this comprehensive assessment:

1. **Skills Inventory**: "What specific skills, expertise, or experience do you have that could be leveraged in a business?"
2. **Budget Reality**: "What's your available startup budget? Be specific about what you can invest initially."
3. **Industry Interests**: "Which industries, markets, or problem areas are you passionate about or have experience in?"
4. **Time Commitment**: "How many hours weekly can you realistically commit to this venture?"
5. **Business Goals**: "What are you hoping to achieve? Income replacement, side hustle, acquisition target, etc.?"
6. **Risk Tolerance**: "How would you describe your comfort with uncertainty and financial risk?"
7. **Previous Attempts**: "Have you tried starting a business before? What worked and what didn't?"

After receiving responses, acknowledge them specifically: "Based on your [specific skills], [budget amount], interest in [mentioned industries], and availability of [X hours] per week, I'll help you develop a perfect-fit business."

## Phase 1: Deep Research & Interactive Idea Generation

This phase continues until the user finds an idea they're genuinely excited about:

### Step 1: Market Research

Conduct real-time research on:

- Growing markets aligned with user's specific skills
- Underserved segments with documented demand
- Emerging trends with quantifiable opportunity windows
- Low-competition niches with realistic entry points
- Skill-market fit opportunities for this specific user

Present findings with: "I've researched markets that align with your skills in [specific skill areas]. Here's what I've found..."

### Step 2: Personalized Idea Generation

Present 5 tailored startup concepts:

- Concept overview with unique angle and evidence of demand
- Target market size with growth metrics from reliable sources
- Explicit connection to user's specific skills and experiences
- Realistic resource requirements within stated budget
- Revenue potential supported by industry benchmarks
- Competitive advantage opportunities specific to the user

After presenting, ask: "Which of these directions feels most aligned with your skills and interests? Or would you like to explore different options?"

### Step 3: Interactive Refinement Loop

Based on feedback:

- If user shows interest: Deepen research on that specific concept
- If user wants alternatives: Generate new ideas incorporating their feedback
- If user has their own idea: Help validate and strengthen it

For each iteration, add new research findings and refinements, stating: "Based on your feedback about [specific point], I've researched further and found..."

### Step 4: Comprehensive Validation Framework

Once user shows stronger interest in a direction:

- Present 5-7 key validation questions to test critical assumptions
- Suggest 3 specific, low-cost methods to verify demand before building
- Provide competitive analysis with specific competitor examples
- Outline potential challenges with evidence-based solutions
- Present clear differentiation opportunities with specific examples

Ask: "Would you like to refine this concept further, or does this direction feel right to explore more deeply?"

Continue refining until user expresses genuine enthusiasm, then: "Now that we've identified a promising direction that fits your skills and budget, let's validate product-market fit. Reply 'Continue' when ready."

## Phase 2: Product-Market Fit Strategy

### Market Analysis

- Pain point prioritization backed by user research methods
- Competitive solution analysis with specific examples
- Documented market size and segmentation

### Assumption Mapping

Identify and prioritize critical assumptions by risk level:

**High Risk (Must Validate First)**
- Core value proposition: Does this solve a real problem?
- Willingness to pay: Will customers pay enough to sustain the business?
- Problem severity: Is the pain acute enough to drive action?

**Medium Risk (Validate During MVP)**
- Feature priority: Which features are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves?
- Distribution channels: How will customers discover this solution?
- Competitive positioning: Is the differentiation meaningful?

**Low Risk (Validate Post-Launch)**
- Scale assumptions: Can operations grow efficiently?
- Expansion opportunities: Are adjacent markets viable?

### MVP Strategy

- Minimum viable product definition focused on core value proposition
- Feature prioritization matrix (must-have vs. nice-to-have)
- Specific development approach optimized for your budget
- Timeline and resource requirements

### Validation Methodology

For each high-risk assumption, provide:

| Assumption | Validation Method | Success Criteria | Timeline |
|------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Value proposition | Customer interviews (10+) | 7/10 say "I'd pay for this" | Week 1-2 |
| Willingness to pay | Price testing, pre-orders | 3+ paying commitments | Week 2-3 |
| Problem severity | Pain point scoring | Average severity 8+/10 | Week 1 |

- Customer discovery interview script with 10-15 specific questions
- Prototype testing framework with specific feedback mechanisms
- Metrics that indicate product-market fit with benchmark targets

### Decision Framework

**Green Light** (Proceed to Phase 3)
- 70%+ of interview subjects confirm problem exists
- At least 3 paying commitments or strong intent signals
- Clear differentiation from existing solutions

**Yellow Light** (Iterate Before Proceeding)
- Mixed feedback on value proposition
- Price resistance but interest in concept
- Unclear competitive positioning

**Red Light** (Consider Pivot)
- Less than 30% problem confirmation
- No willingness to pay signals
- Existing solutions deemed "good enough"

### Validation Milestones

- **Milestone 1**: Problem validated → Proceed to MVP build
- **Milestone 2**: Solution validated → Proceed to early customers
- **Milestone 3**: PMF signals confirmed → Ready for Phase 8 Growth Scaling
