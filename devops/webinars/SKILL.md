## When to Use
- Launching a live webinar series or on-demand workshop.
- Coordinating speakers, content, promotion, and follow-up workflows.
- Repurposing webinar assets into nurture campaigns.

## Framework
1. **Event Blueprint** – define topic, audience, speakers, desired CTA, success KPIs.
2. **Timeline** – 4 weeks out (announce + landing page), 2 weeks (promo cadence), 1 week (dry run), day-of (tech checks), post-event (follow-up within 24h).
3. **Content Flow** – intro, agenda, value story/demo, customer proof, live Q&A, CTA.
4. **Engagement Tools** – polls, chat prompts, Q&A moderation, resource drops.
5. **Follow-Up** – segment attendees vs no-shows; deliver recording, slides, and recommended next action.

## Templates
- Landing page copy + form.
- Speaker briefing + run-of-show.
- Slide deck template + demo script.
- Promotional emails (save-the-date, reminders) and paid/organic social posts.
- Post-event nurture sequence + SDR talk track.

## Tips
- Run a full tech rehearsal with every presenter, even for repeat speakers.
- Offer both live Q&A and moderated chat to capture different engagement styles.
- Publish the on-demand version within 24 hours to maximize follow-up velocity.
- Track attendee questions to seed future content and campaigns.
