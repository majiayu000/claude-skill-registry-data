rmplan is an AI-powered project planning and execution system. It generates detailed plans from issues, executes them with automated agents, and tracks progress through complex multi-phase projects.

Plans are markdown files with metadata (title, goal, priority, status, dependencies, structured tasks) in YAML frontmatter. The markdown contains research findings, implementation guides, and progress tracking.
