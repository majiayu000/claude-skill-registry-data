# Enforce SLSA

Add an **SLSA Verification** (`SlsaVerification`) step to an existing Harness pipeline. The step
verifies SLSA provenance attestations (when enabled) and optionally evaluates OPA policy sets against
provenance data.

This skill only works with **existing pipelines** — do not create standalone verification-only pipelines.

**Prerequisites:** SLSA provenance must already exist for the artifact (typically from a `provenance`
step via `/generate-slsa` — UI label SLSA Generation). Optional **policy sets** for provenance
enforcement (`/create-policy`, `harness_list` `policy_set`).

**Supported stages:** CI, CD (`Deployment`), and Security. CD requires a **containerized step group**.
Unlike SBOM enforcement, CI and CD both use **`SlsaVerification`** (no separate CD step type).

Guide the user through a **step-by-step interactive wizard** (same UX as `/generate-slsa`):

- Wizard: `references/interactive-wizard-flow.md`
- UI ↔ YAML: `references/slsa-verification-step.md`
- CD containerized step groups: `skills/generate-slsa/references/cd-containerized-step-group.md`

## Interaction model (mandatory)

1. **One question per turn** — use `AskQuestion` when available; otherwise numbered options with `(Recommended)`.
2. **Opening message** — add SLSA Verification; mention generation + optional policy prerequisites.
3. **Progress breadcrumb** — after pipeline fetch:
   `Pipeline · Placement · Source · Details · Verify · Policy · Submit`
4. **Record answers** — running summary; do not re-ask unless the user changes direction.
5. **Fetch before configure** — `harness_get` before placement/source questions.
6. **Show pipeline structure** — highlight `provenance` (SLSA Generation) and connectors.
7. **Infer source from generation** — when one `provenance` step exists (or `identifier: slsageneration`), reuse its source (map `repo` → `image_path`, lowercase → PascalCase types).
8. **Never guess image tags** — default from generation step; ask if ambiguous.
9. **Confirm before write** — summary + `harness_update` only after user confirms.
10. **Stop after update** — after successful `harness_update`, provide a configuration summary and
    point the user to `/run-pipeline` to execute. Do **not** call `harness_execute`, poll
    executions, or run `harness_diagnose` in this skill (same pattern as `/configure-repo-scan`).
11. **CD on CI-only pipeline** — do not reject CD verify; run Phase 3b to add Deploy stage + containerized group.
12. **Verify method must match generation** — keyless ↔ keyless, keybased ↔ public key from same key pair.

Full phase prompts: `references/interactive-wizard-flow.md`.

## Instructions

### Wizard phases

| Phase | Breadcrumb | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 0 | Pipeline | AskQuestion: pipeline URL ready? |
| 1 | Pipeline | Collect URL → `harness_get` |
| 2 | Pipeline | Display structure; note missing `provenance` (SLSA Generation) step |
| 3 | Placement | AskQuestion: after generation, CD before deploy, etc. |
| 3b | Placement (CD) | Service, env, infra, step group if new Deploy stage |
| 4 | Source | Infer from generation or pick registry tile |
| 5 | Source | Registry provider (Third-Party only) |
| 6 | Details | Connector (skip if obvious) |
| 7 | Details | Image / image_path (default from generation) |
| 8 | Verify | AskQuestion: verify attestation method |
| 9 | Policy | AskQuestion: policy set(s) or skip |
| 10 | Submit | AskQuestion: confirm pipeline update |

After Phase 10 `confirm` → insert step, `harness_update`, then provide summary (do not run the pipeline).

### Supported stage types

| Stage type | Step `type` | Placement notes |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `CI` | `SlsaVerification` | **After** `provenance` / `slsageneration` in the same stage |
| `Deployment` | `SlsaVerification` | Containerized step group; **before** deploy |
| `Security` | `SlsaVerification` | After generation when artifact is in registry |

### CD edge case

If no `Deployment` stage and user chose CD verify:

> No CD Deploy stage yet. We can add a **Deployment** stage with a **containerized step group** and
> place **SLSA Verification** before deploy.

Run Phase 3b (service, environment, infrastructure, `stepGroupInfra`) — mirror `/generate-slsa` Phase 3b.
Use `skills/generate-slsa/references/cd-containerized-step-group.md` with `SlsaVerification`.

### After the wizard — backend steps

#### Check prerequisites

1. **SLSA generation** — pipeline contains `type: provenance` (SLSA Generation) or user confirms provenance exists.
2. **Policy sets** (optional) — `harness_list(resource_type="policy_set")`. If user wants policy
   enforcement and none exist, direct to `/create-policy` before continuing.

#### Extract context from pipeline YAML

From `provenance` step (if present — also match `identifier: slsageneration`), copy and transform:

| Generation | Verification |
|------------|--------------|
| `source.type: docker` | `source.type: Docker` |
| `source.spec.repo` | `source.spec.image_path` |
| `source.spec.connector` | `source.spec.connector` |
| `spec.attestation` | matching `verify_attestation` (private → public key for keybased) |

#### Generate SLSA verification step YAML

**CI / Security — Docker Registry, keyless verify:**

```yaml
- step:
    identifier: slsaverification
    name: SLSA Verification
    type: SlsaVerification
    spec:
      source:
        type: Docker
        spec:
          connector: lavakush07
          image_path: lavakush07/easy-buggy-app:blog
      verify_attestation:
        type: keyless
        spec:
          oidcProvider: harness
    timeout: 15m
```

**Key-based verify** (generation used `keybased` + private key):

```yaml
      verify_attestation:
        type: keybased
        spec:
          publicKey: account.cosign_public_key
```

If API validation rejects flat `keyless` / `keybased`, retry with nested `cosign` wrapper — see
`references/slsa-verification-step.md`.

**Policy enforcement** (Advanced tab — step-level `enforce`):

```yaml
    enforce:
      policySets:
        - slsa_provenance_rules
```

**No attestation verify** (policy-only): omit `verify_attestation`.

**CD Deploy** — same step type inside containerized `stepGroup`; use `<+artifact.image>` for
`image_path` when verifying service artifacts.

Full provider mapping: `references/slsa-verification-step.md`.

#### Insert step into pipeline YAML

- Insert at Phase 3 placement — **after** `slsageneration` when possible.
- Do not modify unrelated steps.
- Step identifier: `slsaverification` (use `slsaverification_cd` in CD when CI already has one).
- **CD:** inside containerized step group only.

#### Update pipeline via MCP

```
harness_update
  resource_type: pipeline
  resource_id: <pipeline_identifier>
  org_id: <organization>
  project_id: <project>
  body: { yamlPipeline: "<updated pipeline YAML>" }
```

On validation errors, check PascalCase `source.type`, `image_path` vs `repo`, and `verify_attestation`
shape (prefer flat `keyless`; fallback nested `cosign`).

#### Provide summary

Report the results to the user (same pattern as `/configure-repo-scan` — do **not** execute the pipeline):

```
## SLSA Verification Configured

**Pipeline:** <pipeline_name>
**Step:** SLSA Verification (SlsaVerification)
**Location:** Stage "<stage_name>", <position>
**Source:** Docker — <connector> — <image_path>
**Verify attestation:** Keyless (Harness OIDC) — or as configured
**Policy sets:** <list or none>

**Pipeline URL:** https://app.harness.io/ng/account/<account_id>/module/ci/orgs/<org_id>/projects/<project_id>/pipelines/<pipeline_id>/pipeline-studio/

**Note:** Review the SLSA Verification step in Pipeline Studio to adjust Advanced settings.

### Next Steps
1. Run the pipeline via `/run-pipeline` to verify SLSA verification executes successfully
2. If the run fails, diagnose with `/debug-pipeline`
3. View verification outcome on the execution **Supply Chain** tab
4. If **Failed** due to policy deny, tune policies via `/create-policy`
5. Add generation with `/generate-slsa` if provenance was missing
6. Automate with `/create-trigger`
```

**CD pipelines:** note in the summary if runtime inputs (service artifact, environment, infrastructure)
will be required at run time — the user provides those via `/run-pipeline` or Harness UI Run.

## Examples

### Verify after SLSA Generation

```
/enforce-slsa
Add SLSA verification after slsa-generation — keyless verify, policy set slsa_prod_rules
```

### CD before deploy

```
/enforce-slsa
Verify SLSA in deploy stage before K8s rolling deploy for easy-buggy-app:blog
```

### Key-based verify (matches keybased generation)

```
/enforce-slsa
Verify SLSA with public key account.cosign_public_key — same image as generation step
```

---

## Performance Notes

- Only **existing pipelines** (may append Deploy stage).
- **Wizard UX mandatory** — one question per turn.
- **Reuse generation source** — scan for `type: provenance` or `identifier: slsageneration`; map `repo` → `image_path`, lowercase → PascalCase types.
- **Verification `source.type` is PascalCase** (`Docker`) — generation uses lowercase (`docker`).
- **`verify_attestation`** is snake_case (not `verifyAttestation`). Prefer flat `type: keyless` + `oidcProvider` (same shape as generation `attestation`).
- Policy sets on step **`enforce.policySets`** — not `spec.policy` like SBOM enforcement.
- List `policy_set` via MCP — do not invent identifiers.
- **CD:** containerized step group only; see `skills/generate-slsa/references/cd-containerized-step-group.md`.
- **Do not execute pipelines** in this skill — use `/run-pipeline` after configuration (same as `/configure-repo-scan`).
- Pair with `/generate-slsa` (generate) and `/create-policy` (OPA rules).

---

## Troubleshooting

### No SLSA Generation Step
- Add `/generate-slsa` first with attestation enabled (`type: provenance` in YAML).
- Verification needs `.att` in registry or provenance in SCS Artifacts.
- Scan for `provenance` steps — not `SlsaGeneration` (API uses `provenance`).

### Attestation Verification Failed
- Verify method must match generation (`keyless` vs `keybased`).
- Keybased: use **public** key secret (generation uses **private** key).
- Keyless non-harness: configure Connector for Keyless Signing.

### Wrong Image / No Provenance
- Use same `image_path` as generation `repo` field.
- Symptom: verify passes wrong artifact — image mismatch.

### Policy Evaluation Failed
- Review policy set Rego rules; check Supply Chain tab for violations.
- Confirm policy set identifier (not display name) in `enforce.policySets`.

### YAML Validation Errors
- `source.type` must be PascalCase for verification (`Docker`, not `docker`).
- Docker source uses `image_path`, not `repo`.
- `verify_attestation`: use flat `type: keyless` + `spec.oidcProvider: harness` — not nested `cosign` unless API rejects flat shape.
- `DUPLICATE_IDENTIFIER` — rename `slsaverification`.

### CD Step Errors
- Place inside `stepGroup` with `stepGroupInfra` — not top-level `execution.steps`.
- See `skills/generate-slsa/references/cd-containerized-step-group.md`.

### User Chose CD on CI-Only Pipeline
- Expected — run Phase 3b; do not force CI-only unless user changes direction.

### Pipeline Run Failed
- Use `/run-pipeline` to execute and `/debug-pipeline` to diagnose failures
- Confirm verify method matches generation attestation; check public key for keybased
- Missing runtime inputs: provide branch/tag or deploy inputs via `/run-pipeline` or Harness UI Run

### MCP Errors
- `CONNECTOR_NOT_FOUND` — verify connector in Project Settings.
- `ACCESS_DENIED` — PAT needs pipeline edit and policy read permissions.
