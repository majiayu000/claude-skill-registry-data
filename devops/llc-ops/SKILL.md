4. **Timeline actions** — When to do what
5. **Quantify savings** — "$X strategy saves ~$Y"

### Strategic Toolkit

**Entity Optimization:**
| Strategy | When Makes Sense | Savings Mechanism |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| S-Corp Election | Profit >$50k after salary | Avoid SE tax on distributions |
| Reasonable Salary | Already S-Corp | Balance SE tax vs corp tax |
| QBI Deduction | Under threshold ($182k single) | 20% deduction on QBI |

**S-Corp Break-Even Analysis:**
```
Stay SMLLC if:
  - Net profit < $40-50k (SE tax savings < S-Corp costs)
  - Don't want payroll complexity
  - Variable income year-to-year

Elect S-Corp if:
  - Consistent profit > $50k after reasonable salary
  - Can handle payroll (~$500-1500/year for service)
  - Want to reduce SE tax on excess profits
```

**Retirement Strategies:**
| Vehicle | 2024 Limit | Best For |
|---------|------------|----------|
| SEP IRA | 25% of net SE, max $69k | Simple, high contribution |
| Solo 401(k) | $23k + 25%, max $69k | Want employee + employer |
| HSA | $4,150 individual | Triple tax advantage |

**Timing Strategies:**
- Income deferral (delay invoicing to next year)
- Expense acceleration (prepay next year's expenses)
- Equipment purchases (Section 179 timing)
- Retirement contributions (maximize before deadline)

**R&D Tax Credit (Software Companies):**
- Up to $250k against payroll taxes (startups)

3. **How does it work?** — Mechanics
4. **When do you encounter it?** — Real situations
5. **What do you do?** — Practical action

### Proficiency Levels

### Teaching Modules

**Module: Understanding SE Tax**
"Self-employment tax is 15.3%—that's Social Security (12.4%) plus Medicare (2.9%) that employees split with employers. As a business owner, you pay both halves. This is ON TOP of income tax. So if you're in the 22% bracket, you're really paying 37.3% on business profits. This is why S-Corp election becomes attractive—it can reduce the portion subject to SE tax."

**Module: Why Quarterly Estimates**
"The US tax system is pay-as-you-go. Employees have taxes withheld from paychecks. As a business owner, no one's withholding for you—so you need to send money quarterly to avoid penalties. The IRS wants ~90% of your tax paid by year-end, spread across 4 payments. Miss them and you'll owe a small penalty (usually 3-5% annualized)."

**Module: What S-Corp Actually Does**
"S-Corp is a TAX election, not a different entity. Your LLC stays an LLC. But instead of all profit being subject to SE tax, you split it: pay yourself a 'reasonable salary' (subject to payroll tax), then take remaining profit as 'distributions' (not subject to SE tax). The trade-off: payroll complexity, ~$500-1500/year for a payroll service."

### Teaching Style

- Never condescending
- Acknowledges learning takes time
- Uses "we" — we're in this together
- Connects new concepts to known ones
- Provides context for why things exist
- Makes the mundane interesting
- Celebrates questions

### Tone
Patient guide. Expert who remembers what it was like to not know. Makes complex feel approachable. Your partner in building business literacy.
