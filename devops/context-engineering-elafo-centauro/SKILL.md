description: Comprehensive context engineering and management system based on the framework C = A(c₁, c₂, c₃, c₄, c₅, c₆). Use this skill when users work with context files, ask about context engineering, need to create/update/analyze contexts, validate context quality, detect discrepancies between contexts, or manage their Context Engineering system. Triggers include: "create a context", "analyze context", "check for inconsistencies", "validate context quality", "update context", "context engineering", "manage contexts", "c1-c6 components", or when working with .claude/contexts/ directories.

# Context Engineering Skill

Expert system for managing the complete lifecycle of context files in Context Engineering systems based on the framework **C = A(c₁, c₂, c₃, c₄, c₅, c₆)**.

## Core Capabilities

This skill provides comprehensive context management including:

- **Classification**: Categorize content into the correct component type (c₁-c₆)
- **Creation**: Generate well-structured context files from source materials
- **Analysis**: Evaluate context quality using the 4-dimensional framework
- **Validation**: Detect contradictions, gaps, and discrepancies across contexts
- **Updates**: Evolve contexts with proper semantic versioning
- **Inventory**: List, categorize, and manage context portfolios

## Communication Principles

- **Decisive**: Make clear recommendations with transparent reasoning ("This is c₂ because...", not "Could be c₁ or c₂...")
- **Quantified**: Use quality grades (A-F), numeric scores (0.XX), estimated impact when possible
- **Actionable**: Provide specific steps ("Update lines 45-67 of file.md"), not generalities
- **Conservative with destructive changes**: Ask confirmation before deleting contexts or making MAJOR changes
- **Autonomous with low-risk operations**: Create, list, analyze without constantly asking
- **Offer next steps**: Always end with "Would you like me to...?" or "Next steps: [1] [2] [3]"

## Framework Overview

### The Six Components

**C = A(c₁, c₂, c₃, c₄, c₅, c₆)** where:
- **c₁ (Instructions)**: HOW to do things - methodologies, workflows, processes
- **c₂ (Knowledge)**: WHAT things are - domain knowledge, theories, frameworks
- **c₃ (Tools)**: Technical capabilities - APIs, functions, available tools
- **c₄ (Memory)**: Past experiences - decisions, learnings, historical context
- **c₅ (State)**: Current situation - active resources, present configuration
- **c₆ (Query)**: Immediate request - user's current question or task

### Quality Framework

Quality is measured across 4 dimensions:

**Q = α·Relevance + β·Completeness + γ·Consistency + δ·Efficiency**

Where:
- **α = 0.40** (Relevance): I(Context; Query) - mutual information
- **β = 0.30** (Completeness): Coverage of required elements
- **γ = 0.20** (Consistency): Absence of contradictions
- **δ = 0.10** (Efficiency): Information density per token

**Grading Scale:**
- **A (≥0.90)**: Excellent, production-ready
- **B (0.80-0.89)**: Good, minor improvements optional
- **C (0.70-0.79)**: Acceptable, refinement recommended
- **D (0.60-0.69)**: Deficient, requires significant work
- **F (<0.60)**: Inadequate, consider rewriting

- Validating consistency across multiple contexts
- Updating contexts with new information
- Managing the context portfolio (listing, prioritizing, organizing)
- Troubleshooting context-related issues

### Typical Workflows

**1. Creating a New Context:**
1. Analyze source material
2. Classify into appropriate component (c₁-c₆)
3. Extract and structure content
4. Apply metadata standards
5. Validate quality
6. Save to appropriate location

**2. Analyzing Context Quality:**
1. Read context file
2. Evaluate across 4 dimensions (Relevance, Completeness, Consistency, Efficiency)
3. Calculate quality score and grade
4. Identify specific improvement opportunities
5. Generate quality report

**3. Detecting Discrepancies:**
1. Identify related contexts
2. Extract claims and assertions
3. Cross-reference for contradictions
4. Identify gaps and missing links
5. Generate discrepancy report with recommendations
