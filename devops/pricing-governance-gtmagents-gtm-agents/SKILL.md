# Pricing Governance Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- Facilitating pricing council meetings or steering committees.
- Logging approvals, assumptions, and launch timing for pricing changes.
- Auditing pricing experiments or discount policy adjustments.

## Framework
1. **Council Charter** – define members, meeting cadence, decision rights, and escalation paths.
2. **Decision Log** – capture proposals, outcomes, rationales, and follow-up actions.
3. **Approval Matrix** – map thresholds (discount %, price change scope) to required approvers.
4. **Communication Hooks** – standardize templates for stakeholder updates and launch checklists.
5. **Audit Trail** – store artifacts (models, decks, FAQs) and post-launch performance reviews.

## Templates
- Council agenda + minutes doc.
- Decision log spreadsheet with filters.
- Launch readiness checklist with owners/dates.

## Tips
- Keep logs centralized to reduce drift across regions.
- Pair with `enablement-kit` to ensure decisions convert to frontline training.
- Schedule retro sessions at 30/60/90 days post-launch to validate assumptions.
