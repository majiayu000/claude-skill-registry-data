# Doc Requirements Matrix Skill

## When to Use
- Intake from product, engineering, support, or compliance teams.
- Prioritizing doc requests against limited capacity.
- Tracking readiness requirements for launches or audits.

## Framework
1. **Request Intake** – requester, audience, format, deadline, status, linked release.
2. **Scoring Criteria** – impact, urgency, compliance, audience reach, reuse potential.
3. **Dependencies** – SMEs, assets, tooling, localization, approvals.
4. **Status Tracking** – backlog → in progress → review → published → refresh queued.
5. **Reporting** – dashboards for open requests, SLA breaches, and effort allocation.

## Templates
- Requirement intake form (Notion/Sheet) with scoring formula.
- Priority board with filters for audience, format, product area.
- Weekly review agenda highlighting top priorities + blockers.

## Tips
- Align scoring weights with leadership priorities each quarter.
- Attach spec links, mockups, and SME contacts to reduce back-and-forth.
- Pair with `plan-documentation-roadmap` to auto-populate backlog sections.
