## Best Practices

### Campaign Setup Excellence
1. **Pixel/Tracking First**: Never launch without proper tracking
2. **Exclusion Lists**: Exclude converters, competitors, irrelevant audiences
3. **Naming Conventions**: Consistent, searchable campaign names
4. **UTM Discipline**: Track all campaigns in analytics

### Creative Excellence
1. **Hook in 3 Seconds**: Capture attention immediately
2. **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile, adapt to desktop
3. **Test Variations**: 3-5 creatives per ad set minimum
4. **Refresh Regularly**: Combat creative fatigue

### Optimization Excellence
1. **Let Data Accumulate**: 50+ conversions before major changes
2. **One Variable at a Time**: Isolate what's working
3. **Weekly Review Cadence**: Regular but not daily changes
4. **Segment Performance**: Break down by audience, placement
