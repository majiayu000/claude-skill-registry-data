# Circle of Competence

## Overview
The Circle of Competence, articulated by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, emphasizes knowing the boundaries of your genuine expertise. The key insight isn't about having a large circle—it's about knowing precisely where your circle ends. Operating within your circle leads to better decisions; operating outside it without recognizing it leads to costly mistakes.

**Core Principle:** "Know what you don't know. The boundaries of your circle are more important than its size." — Warren Buffett

## When to Use
- Evaluating new opportunities or projects
- Making decisions in unfamiliar domains
- Assessing whether to delegate or learn
- Investment or resource allocation decisions
- Taking on new responsibilities
- Advising others on topics
- Hiring or team composition decisions

Decision flow:
```
Decision to make? → yes → Inside your circle? → yes → Proceed with confidence
                                              ↘ no → Delegate, learn, or pass
                ↘ no → Not applicable
```

## The Three Zones

### Zone 1: Inside Your Circle
**True competence through deep experience**

Characteristics:
- You've made decisions here repeatedly
- You've seen failure modes firsthand
- You can predict second-order effects
- You know what you don't know within this area
- You can teach others the nuances

```
Example: Senior backend engineer
Inside circle:
- API design patterns that scale
- Database optimization strategies
- When to use caching vs. not
- Common failure modes in distributed systems
- Debugging production issues
```

### Zone 2: Edge of Your Circle
**Familiar but not expert**

Characteristics:
- You know the basics
- You can have informed conversations
- You might miss edge cases
- You need to verify your assumptions
- You should seek review from experts

```
Example: Same backend engineer
Edge of circle:
- Frontend performance optimization
- Basic security practices
- Cloud cost optimization
- Team management fundamentals
```

### Zone 3: Outside Your Circle
**Dangerous territory**

Characteristics:
- Knowledge is superficial or outdated
- You don't know what you don't know
- Decisions feel confident but are often wrong
- High risk of Dunning-Kruger effect
- Should delegate or deeply learn before deciding

```
Example: Same backend engineer
Outside circle:
- Mobile app development
- Machine learning model tuning
- Legal/compliance decisions
- Financial forecasting
```

## Mapping Your Circle

### Step 1: List Your Domains
What areas do you have experience in?
- Professional skills
- Industry knowledge
- Technical domains
- Business functions

### Step 2: Assess Depth Honestly
For each domain, ask:

| Question | Inside | Edge | Outside |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| Could I teach this to an expert? | ✓ | | |
| Have I made real decisions here? | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Do I know the failure modes? | ✓ | | |
| Can I predict second-order effects? | ✓ | | |
| Do I know what I don't know here? | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Is my knowledge current? | ✓ | | |

### Step 3: Be Brutally Honest
Common self-deceptions:
- "I read a lot about it" ≠ competence
- "I understand the concepts" ≠ can execute
- "I did it once years ago" ≠ current competence
- "I'm smart, I can figure it out" ≠ expertise

### Step 4: Verify with Track Record
Look at past decisions:
- In areas you consider "inside," were you right?
- In areas you consider "edge," did you make mistakes?
- This calibrates your self-assessment

## Operating Within Your Circle

### When Inside: Act with Confidence
```
✓ Make decisions directly
✓ Move quickly
✓ Trust your intuition (it's trained)
✓ Teach and mentor others
✓ Push back on outside opinions if warranted
```

### When at Edge: Proceed with Caution
```
→ Seek input from those with deeper expertise
→ Validate assumptions before acting
→ Build in more margin for error
→ Document reasoning for review
→ Use this as learning opportunity
```

### When Outside: Delegate or Learn
```
Option A: Delegate
- Find someone with this in their circle
- Trust their judgment
- Don't override without strong reason

Option B: Learn First
- Invest significant time (months/years)
- Get hands-on experience
- Make small decisions first, learn from mistakes
- Gradually expand circle

Option C: Pass
- Some opportunities aren't for you
- "I don't know enough" is valid
- Opportunity cost of learning may be too high
```

## Common Traps

### Trap 1: Circle Creep
Your circle in one area doesn't extend to adjacent areas:
```
Inside: iOS development
Doesn't mean inside: Android development
Doesn't mean inside: iOS design
Doesn't mean inside: iOS project management
```

### Trap 2: Stale Expertise
Circles shrink if not maintained:
```
2015: Expert in jQuery
2024: jQuery knowledge is inside, but modern frontend is edge/outside
```

### Trap 3: Confidence Misread as Competence
Feeling confident ≠ being competent:
```
Dunning-Kruger peak: Know just enough to feel expert
Actually expert: Know enough to know how much you don't know
```

### Trap 4: Smart Person Syndrome
General intelligence doesn't expand circles:
```
Being smart at X doesn't make you competent at Y
Many smart people fail at investments, businesses, etc.
because they operate outside their circle confidently
```

## Application Examples

### Technical Decisions
```
Question: Should we adopt GraphQL?

Self-assessment:
- Have I built and maintained GraphQL at scale? No → Outside
- Do I know the failure modes? No → Outside
- Have I seen it succeed/fail in similar contexts? Partially → Edge

Decision: Consult with team members who have deep GraphQL experience,
         or run small pilot before committing
```

### Career Decisions
```
Question: Should I become a manager?

Self-assessment:
- Have I led teams before? A little → Edge
- Do I know management failure modes? Not really → Outside
- Can I predict what makes a good manager? Vaguely → Edge

Decision: Don't assume IC success transfers; seek mentorship,
         start with small team, treat as learning opportunity
```

### Business Decisions
```
Question: Should I invest in this startup?

Self-assessment:
- Do I understand this market? Superficially → Edge
- Can I evaluate the technology? No → Outside
- Do I know startup failure modes? Generally → Edge
- Have I made successful startup investments? No → Outside

Decision: This is outside my circle; either pass or find
         co-investors who have this in their circle
```

## Expanding Your Circle

### The Right Way
1. Start at the edge, not outside
2. Make small, reversible decisions
3. Get feedback on those decisions
4. Learn from mistakes in low-stakes situations
5. Build pattern recognition over time
6. Graduate to larger decisions as track record develops

### The Wrong Way
- Jump straight to big decisions in new domain
- Assume competence transfers
- Learn only theory without practice
- Avoid feedback on decisions
- Never acknowledge mistakes

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Identified which zone this decision falls in
- [ ] If edge/outside: acknowledged uncertainty explicitly
- [ ] If outside: identified who has this in their circle
- [ ] If proceeding outside circle: limited downside exposure
- [ ] Honest about track record in this domain
- [ ] Not conflating confidence with competence

## Key Questions
- "Would I bet significant money on my judgment here?"
- "Have I made similar decisions successfully before?"
- "What don't I know that an expert would know?"
- "If I'm wrong, how would I know?"
- "Who has this in their circle that I could consult?"
- "Is my knowledge here current or stale?"

## Buffett's Reminder
"What counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don't know."

The advantage comes not from having the biggest circle, but from staying inside whatever circle you have—and knowing exactly where the boundary is.
