# Canvas Issue

Create GitHub issues directly from agent-canvas sessions with element context, screenshots, and page information.

## Overview

Canvas Issue integrates with agent-canvas to streamline bug reporting and feature request creation. When you've identified a UI problem or need to document an issue, this skill captures:

- Selected element information
- Screenshot of the page
- Page URL and context
- Custom title and description

Issues are created with all context automatically attached, making them actionable for developers.
