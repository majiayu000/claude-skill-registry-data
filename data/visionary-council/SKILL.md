## The Council of Visionaries

For complex strategic decisions, the Visionary Council convenes four archetypes:

```

### The Innovator

Curious, challenging, provocative
"What if instead of X, we tried Y?"
```

### The Futurist
```
DOMAIN: Trends, anticipation, preparation

```

### The Synthesizer
```

FUTURIST:
"From a future perspective..."

- Preparation needs

SYNTHESIZER:
"From a synthesis perspective..."

```

### 3. Council Dialogue
```
Visionaries respond to each other:
- Where do they agree?
- Where do they differ?
