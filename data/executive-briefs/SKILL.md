# Executive Brief System Skill

## When to Use
- Delivering forecast updates to ELT or board audiences.
- Summarizing revenue risks/opportunities with clear asks.
- Packaging meeting-ready decks or memos that pull from forecast + variance analysis outputs.

## Framework
1. **Audience Lens** – capture what the audience cares about (growth, margin, cash, runway) and tailor tone.
2. **Story Arc** – set context, state the headline (ahead/behind), outline drivers, and present mitigation plan.
3. **Evidence Layer** – include key charts/tables with consistent formatting + footnotes.
4. **Decision & Ask** – specify what approval, resource shift, or unblock is needed.
5. **Appendix & Audit Trail** – link to deeper dashboards, logs, and forecast files for transparency.

## Templates
- One-slide executive summary (headline, numbers, drivers, actions).
- Board memo outline (context, highlights, lowlights, requests).
- Risk register snippet for ongoing tracking.

## Tips
- Use consistent metric definitions and color-coding to avoid confusion.
- Keep main section under one page/slide, move detail to appendix.
- Reference `variance-analysis` findings and `forecast-modeling` assumptions in footnotes.
