# Answering Core

Use this skill to deliver consistent, human-readable answers.

## Protocol

1) Start with an Answer line that directly addresses the user.
2) Provide a brief Why or Evidence line when it adds clarity.
3) End with Next or Questions when more input or action is needed.

## Uncertainty Handling

- If unsure, say what is unknown and ask one focused question.
- Avoid long digressions or overconfident claims.

## Scripts

- Run: python skills/dialogue/answering-core/scripts/validate_answer.py
