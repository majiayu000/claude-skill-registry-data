# Customer Trust Dashboard Skill

## When to Use
- Tracking impact of communications, outages, or policy changes on customer trust.
- Preparing exec/regulator updates on sentiment, complaints, and remediation status.
- Coordinating GTM, support, and risk teams on follow-up actions.

## Framework
1. **KPI Stack** – sentiment, NPS, complaint volume, escalation stage, resolution SLA, refund exposure.
2. **Segmentation** – audience (retail, SMB, enterprise), geography, channel, product.
3. **Signal Sources** – support tickets, surveys, social monitoring, regulator portals, payments data.
4. **Alerting Rules** – thresholds, triggers, routing to comms/legal/risk teams.
5. **Action Register** – log remediation tasks, owners, due dates, and status for transparency.

## Templates
- Dashboard layout with hero metrics, drill-down tabs, and commentary sections.
- Incident log sheet tied to metrics for root-cause tracking.
- Weekly trust report template for leadership + regulator sharing.

## Tips
- Blend quantitative trends with qualitative excerpts for context.
- Keep a “regulator ready” version with evidence attachments and approvals.
- Pair with `manage-trust-communications` and `review-financial-campaign` outputs.
