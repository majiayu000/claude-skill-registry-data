# Constrained Decoding

Use this skill to design and apply output constraints.

## Workflow

1) Define allowed schema or option set.
2) Validate outputs against constraints.
3) Reject or correct invalid outputs.
4) Record constraint breaches.

## Output expectations

- Provide schema and validation results.
