# D&D 5e Rules Reference

This skill provides guidance on finding and using D&D 5e rules for campaign content creation.

## Quick Reference

For most content creation tasks, agents should:
1. Use general D&D knowledge (training data includes extensive 5e coverage)
2. State mechanical assumptions explicitly so humans can verify
3. Prefer narrative-first design over mechanical precision

## When to Look Up Rules

**Always verify:**
- Exact spell effects and ranges
- Monster stat blocks (CR, HP, AC, abilities)
- Class features at specific levels
- Magic item properties

**Usually fine from memory:**
- General combat flow (actions, bonus actions, reactions)
- Advantage/disadvantage mechanics
- Skill checks and DCs
- Common conditions (prone, grappled, frightened)

## Rules Philosophy for Content Creation

### "Right Enough" Standard

The goal is rules that enable fun roleplay, not perfect simulation. When designing content:

1. **Narrative coherence > mechanical precision** - A dragon's breath should feel terrifying even if we estimate the DC
2. **Player agency > strict rules** - If a creative solution could work, lean toward allowing it
3. **Consistency within campaign > RAW** - House rules that stick are better than looking up edge cases

### Common Agent Pitfalls

From CLAUDE.md guidance on agent limitations with rules:

> Training mixes up similar systems and homebrew. Exact modifiers and edge cases may be wrong. Always verify mechanical details against source material.

Specific watch-outs:
- Pathfinder 2e vs D&D 5e (different action economy)
- D&D 5e 2014 vs 2024 rules (significant class changes)
- Homebrew that got into training data
- Video game adaptations (Baldur's Gate 3 has differences)

### Stating Assumptions

When creating content with mechanical elements, be explicit:

**Good:**
> The trap triggers on a DC 15 Perception check to notice, DC 12 Dexterity save to avoid, dealing 2d6 piercing damage (appropriate for a level 3 party).

**Bad:**
> The trap is moderately difficult to detect and does some damage.

## Downloading SRD for Local Reference

To add SRD content to this repository for agent reference:

```bash
# Clone the SRD wiki (5.1)
git clone https://github.com/OldManUmby/DND.SRD.Wiki.git references/srd-5.1

# Or just the specific folders you need
# The full repo is ~10MB
```

Consider adding only the sections most relevant to your campaigns to keep the repo focused.
