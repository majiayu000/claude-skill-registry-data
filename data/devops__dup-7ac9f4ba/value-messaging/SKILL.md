# Value Messaging Matrix Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing sales/CS enablement for new pricing launches.
- Crafting website/product copy that explains packaging differences.
- Equipping deal desk with talk tracks for defending price/value.

## Framework
1. **Tier Overview** – summarize who each package is for and core outcomes.
2. **Value Pillars** – list 3-4 benefits per tier with quantified proof.
3. **Proof Layer** – attach customer stories, metrics, analyst quotes per pillar.
4. **Objections & Responses** – map common pricing objections with rebuttals + trade-up logic.
5. **Upgrade Path** – outline triggers for upsell/cross-sell conversations.

## Templates
- Tier one-pager (audience, benefits, proof, CTA).
- Objection-response table.
- Upsell trigger checklist.

## Tips
- Align language with brand/PMM messaging to avoid drift.
- Include TCO comparisons vs status quo/competitors.
- Pair with `packaging-framework` to keep messaging tied to fences.
