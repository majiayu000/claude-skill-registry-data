## Validation Checklist

Before completing SWOT analysis:

- [ ] Scope and objective clearly defined
- [ ] Strengths verified with evidence
- [ ] Weaknesses honestly assessed
- [ ] Opportunities sized and prioritized
- [ ] Threats evaluated by likelihood and impact
- [ ] Internal vs. external factors correctly categorized
- [ ] Strategic implications derived
- [ ] Action plans developed with owners and timelines
- [ ] Cross-functional input gathered
- [ ] Analysis reviewed for completeness and accuracy

## Examples

**Example 1: SaaS Product SWOT**

Input: "Create a SWOT analysis for our SaaS project management tool"

Process:
1. Define scope (product-specific SWOT)
2. Identify strengths (ease of use, integrations, pricing)
3. Note weaknesses (limited enterprise features, brand awareness)
4. Research opportunities (remote work trend, underserved segments)
5. Assess threats (established competitors, new entrants)
6. Develop SO/ST/WO/WT strategies
7. Prioritize actions

Output: Complete SWOT with strategic action plan

**Example 2: Market Entry SWOT**

Input: "Should we expand to the European market?"

Process:
1. Assess strengths (product-market fit, capital availability)
2. Identify weaknesses (no local presence, regulatory knowledge gaps)
3. Research opportunities (large TAM, less competition)
4. Analyze threats (GDPR compliance, local competitors)
5. Evaluate if strengths can overcome weaknesses
6. Recommend go/no-go decision

Output: SWOT-based market entry recommendation

## Additional Notes

- SWOT is a starting point, not a complete strategy
- Combine with other analyses (competitor, market, financial)
- Review and update SWOT quarterly or when major changes occur
- Use SWOT outputs to inform OKRs and strategic initiatives
- Link to competitive-intelligence for threat identification
- Use researching-markets for opportunity discovery
- Connect to analyzing-business-models for strength/weakness assessment
- SWOT is most valuable when it drives action, not just documentation
