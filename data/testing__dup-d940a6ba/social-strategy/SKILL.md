# Social Media Strategy Skill

## Core Philosophy

> "Social media is not a megaphone. It's a conversation."

In 2024, social media success comes from authentic engagement and platform-native content. Broadcasting doesn't work; building community does. Algorithms favor content that sparks genuine interaction.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Platform-Native Content
- Each platform has its own culture and format
- Don't just cross-post the same content everywhere
- Adapt messaging to platform expectations
- Respect platform-specific norms

### 2. Value Over Promotion
- 80/20 rule: 80% value, 20% promotion
- Teach, don't sell
- Share insights, not just links
- Be helpful first, promotional second

### 3. Authentic Voice
- Maintain brand voice while being human
- Engage in two-way conversations
- Respond to comments and mentions
- Be approachable and relatable

### 4. Consistency Over Virality
- Regular posting beats occasional viral hits
- Build trust through reliability
- Sustainable rhythm > burnout cycles

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### X (Twitter)

**Audience Characteristics:**
- Real-time conversations and breaking news
- 48% of users are there for news updates
- Tech and developer community is very active
- Quick, witty exchanges valued

**Content Strategy:**
```
Best Performing Content Types:
1. Threads (educational, storytelling)
2. Quick tips and insights
3. Hot takes and opinions
4. Behind-the-scenes content
5. Engagement bait (questions, polls)

Avoid:
- External links in main tweets (algorithm penalty)
- Generic promotional content
- Over-hashtagging
- Automated cross-posts
```

**Format Guidelines:**
```
Single Tweet:
- Max 280 characters, but shorter often performs better
- 1-2 hashtags maximum
- Images increase engagement 150%+
- Keep links in replies, not main tweet

Threads:
- Hook in first tweet (make it standalone-worthy)
- 5-15 tweets optimal length
- Number format: "1/🧵" or "1/"
- End with a call to action
- Self-reply immediately after posting
```
