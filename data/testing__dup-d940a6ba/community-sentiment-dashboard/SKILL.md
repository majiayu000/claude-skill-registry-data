# Community Sentiment Dashboard Skill

## When to Use
- Weekly/monthly social listening readouts.
- Real-time monitoring during launches, incidents, or crisis scenarios.
- Executive updates that require quantified sentiment + qualitative insights.

## Framework
1. **Signal Sources** – social listening feeds, community platforms, support tags, surveys.
2. **Sentiment Stack** – volume, sentiment %, topics, influencer tiers, escalation status.
3. **Risk/Opportunity Board** – flagged issues, severity, owners, response progress.
4. **Advocacy Spotlight** – top advocates, UGC, partnership opportunities.
5. **Action Register** – follow-ups routed to comms, product, support, leadership.

## Templates
- Dashboard slide layout (KPI tiles + trend graphs + highlights/lowlights).
- Escalation tracker with severity, owner, due date, next update.
- Advocate tracker with contact info, potential activation ideas.

## Tips
- Set alert thresholds per channel to avoid noise fatigue.
- Pair qualitative snippets with data visuals for executive context.
