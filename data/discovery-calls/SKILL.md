# Discovery Calls Skill

## When to Use
- New prospects booked from outbound/marketing sequences.
- SDRs/BDRs need a structured first-call script.
- AEs want to validate multi-threaded opportunities quickly.

## Framework
1. **PREP** – Purpose, Research, Evidence, Plan before every call.
2. **Call Flow** – Rapport & agenda → context → pain/impact → vision → next steps.
3. **Question Set** – workflow, trigger, stakeholders, success criteria, urgency, budget.
4. **Note Capture** – log company, initiatives, tools, pain, decision team, timeline, next actions.
5. **Qualification Overlay** – map answers to MEDDICC/BANT to guide handoff.

## Templates
- **Question Bank**: See `references/question_bank.md` for persona-specific questions.
- **Scorecard**: See `assets/scorecard.md` for MEDDICC/BANT qualification.
- **Notes Template**:
```
Company / Persona:
Initiatives:
Current Tools / Process:
Pain / Impact:
Decision Team:
Timeline & Budget:
Next Actions:
```
- **Post-call recap email**: (summary → insights → next meeting confirmation).

## Tips
- Time-box sections (2/3/8/4/3) to keep 30-min calls crisp.
- Mirror the prospect’s vocabulary from research notes to build rapport fast.
- Always confirm next steps live and send recap within 1 hour.
- Tag recordings with chapters so AEs can jump to pain/impact moments.
