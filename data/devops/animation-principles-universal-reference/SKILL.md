# Animation Principles - Universal Reference

Disney's 12 principles work at every skill level. Here's each principle with scalable depth.

## 1. Squash and Stretch

**Core idea:** Objects deform to show motion and impact.
**Beginner:** Ball flattens when it hits ground.
**Advanced:** Volume must remain constant. Facial animation uses micro-squash for expression.
**Key insight:** Even "rigid" objects can use the principle through camera shake or motion blur.

## 2. Anticipation

**Core idea:** Prepare the viewer for action.
**Beginner:** Crouch before jump.
**Advanced:** Anticipation size controls audience expectation. Absence creates surprise.
**Key insight:** Every action that needs to read clearly needs setup.

## 3. Staging

**Core idea:** Present one clear idea at a time.
**Beginner:** Put important things where viewers will look.
**Advanced:** Silhouette test, negative space, compositional psychology.
**Key insight:** Confusion is never the viewer's fault.

## 4. Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose

**Core idea:** Two methods - sequential vs. key-pose-first.
**Beginner:** Different ways to approach the same animation.
**Advanced:** Choose based on need: control vs. spontaneity. Hybrid approaches for complex shots.
**Key insight:** The method shapes the result's energy.

## 5. Follow Through and Overlapping Action

**Core idea:** Different parts stop at different times.
**Beginner:** Hair keeps moving after head stops.
**Advanced:** Drag, settle, overlap hierarchy. Emotional implications of follow through weight.
**Key insight:** Simultaneous stopping looks robotic.

## 6. Slow In and Slow Out

**Core idea:** Things accelerate and decelerate.
**Beginner:** More drawings at start and end, fewer in middle.
**Advanced:** Custom easing curves. Snap, bounce, drift variations.
**Key insight:** Even spacing reads mechanical.

## 7. Arc

**Core idea:** Natural motion follows curves.
**Beginner:** Arms swing in arcs, not straight lines.
**Advanced:** Track all motion paths. Breaking arcs intentionally for mechanical/sudden effects.
**Key insight:** Straight paths require justification.

## 8. Secondary Action

**Core idea:** Additional movement supporting the main action.
**Beginner:** Whistling while walking.
**Advanced:** Can create emotional counterpoint. Must support, never compete.
**Key insight:** If it distracts, remove it.

## 9. Timing

**Core idea:** Frame count creates weight, mood, meaning.
**Beginner:** Fast = light/quick. Slow = heavy/deliberate.
**Advanced:** Frame-level sensitivity. Same pose, different timing = different meaning.
**Key insight:** Timing is the acting.

## 10. Exaggeration

**Core idea:** Push reality further for clarity and impact.
**Beginner:** Bigger reactions than real life.
**Advanced:** Style-calibrated exaggeration. Finding essence to amplify.
**Key insight:** Usually push further than instinct suggests.

## 11. Solid Drawing

**Core idea:** Create sense of three-dimensional form.
**Beginner:** Make drawings feel like they have weight and depth.
**Advanced:** Consistent volume through motion. Strategic flatness for graphic impact.
**Key insight:** Viewers have touched things their whole lives. Drawings should feel touchable.

## 12. Appeal

**Core idea:** Make characters compelling to watch.
**Beginner:** Interesting, clear, distinctive design.
**Advanced:** Appeal isn't beauty - villains need it too. Compelling through any aesthetic.
**Key insight:** Would you want to keep watching?
