# Dual Timezone Skill

Manages dual timezone awareness (Florida/Israel), Shabbat observance, and time-sensitive scheduling.

## When to Use This Skill

- Displaying current time to Ariel
- Scheduling tasks or events
- Coordinating calls with Israel
- Shabbat/holiday planning
- Any time-sensitive communication

## Timezones

**Primary:** America/New_York (Eastern Time)  
**Secondary:** Asia/Jerusalem (Israel Time)

**Time Difference:**
- Standard Time: IL is 7 hours ahead of FL
- Daylight Saving: IL is 7 hours ahead of FL
- (Israel doesn't observe DST same dates as US)

## Display Format

**Standard format:**
```
🕐 FL: 10:00 PM EST | IL: 5:00 AM IST
```

**When to show:**
- Starting any conversation
- Scheduling suggestions
- Time-sensitive decisions
- Before/after Shabbat
- When energy levels matter

## Shabbat Observance

### Shabbat Times

**Friday:**
- Candle lighting: ~18 minutes before sunset (varies by location)
- Start: Sundown Friday evening
- NO WORK from candle lighting onward

**Saturday:**
- Ends: Havdalah (nightfall, ~42 minutes after sunset)
- NO WORK until havdalah

### Shabbat Restrictions

**Prohibited:**
- Computer use
- Phone use
- Writing/typing
- Business activities
- Swimming competitions (for Michael)
- Travel (driving)

**Permitted:**
- Walking
- Reading
- Family meals
- Synagogue
- Rest and study

### Shabbat-Aware Scheduling

**DO NOT schedule:**
- Friday after 4 PM EST (winter) / 6 PM EST (summer)
- All day Saturday until ~8 PM EST

**SAFE times:**
- Sunday-Thursday: Any time
- Friday: Before 4 PM EST (conservative)
- Saturday night: After 8:30 PM EST

## Michael Swimming & Shabbat

**CRITICAL RULE:**
```
NO swimming competitions from Friday sundown → Saturday havdalah
```

When researching D1 programs:
- Ask about meet schedules
- Flag programs with regular Friday night/Saturday meets
- Prioritize programs respecting religious observance

## Energy Level Awareness

### Florida Time Zones

**High Energy (Best for Complex Tasks):**
- 8 AM - 12 PM EST: Peak focus
- Use for: coding, architecture, decisions

**Medium Energy:**
- 12 PM - 5 PM EST: Steady work
- Use for: implementation, testing

**Low Energy (Avoid Complex Work):**
- 9 PM - 11 PM EST: Winding down
- Use for: planning, light tasks, defer heavy work

**Sleep Zone:**
- 11 PM - 7 AM EST: Do not disturb
- Exception: Urgent issues only

### Task Scheduling Suggestions

```
Current time: 10:30 PM EST

Suggestion: "It's late evening (10:30 PM). This task could take 90 minutes. 
Better to start fresh tomorrow morning (8-9 AM EST)? Or quick version now?"
```

## Prayer Times (Awareness)

**Daily prayers (approximate):**
- Shacharit (morning): ~7-9 AM EST
- Mincha (afternoon): ~4-6 PM EST (varies by season)
- Maariv (evening): After nightfall

**Not strict scheduling blocks**, but awareness:
- Don't expect immediate response during prayer times
- Especially Friday evening and Saturday morning

## Holiday Awareness

**Major holidays (similar restrictions to Shabbat):**
- Rosh Hashanah (2 days)
- Yom Kippur (1 day)
- Sukkot (first 2 days, last 2 days)
- Passover (first 2 days, last 2 days)
- Shavuot (2 days)

**Holidays → NO computer/phone work**

When holiday approaches:
```
Note: Rosh Hashanah starts Wednesday evening. 
Let's complete critical tasks by Tuesday.
```

## Israel Coordination

**When family is in Israel:**
- Calls typically early morning FL / late afternoon IL
- Example: 8 AM EST = 3 PM IST
- Avoid calling after 10 PM IST (3 PM EST)

**WhatsApp Usage:**
- Async communication preferred
- Time-insensitive messages

## Example Time Conversions

```
FL → IL (add 7 hours):
- 10 AM EST → 5 PM IST
- 3 PM EST → 10 PM IST
- 8 PM EST → 3 AM IST (next day)

IL → FL (subtract 7 hours):
- 9 AM IST → 2 AM EST (same day)
- 2 PM IST → 7 AM EST
- 8 PM IST → 1 PM EST
```

## Shabbat Entry/Exit Times

**Get from:**
- Chabad.org
- hebcal.com
- MyZmanim app

**Example (Satellite Beach, FL - Winter):**
- Candle lighting: 5:12 PM EST Friday
- Havdalah: 6:08 PM EST Saturday

**Example (Satellite Beach, FL - Summer):**
- Candle lighting: 7:58 PM EST Friday
- Havdalah: 8:54 PM EST Saturday

## Time Display Triggers

**Always show time when:**
- Starting conversation
- Suggesting schedule
- Before task requiring >1 hour
- Near Shabbat (Friday 2 PM onward)
- Energy-level-dependent decision

**Format:**
```
🕐 FL: [time] EST | IL: [time] IST
```

## Scheduling Decision Tree

```
Is it Friday after 2 PM EST?
  └─→ Yes: Flag Shabbat approaching, defer non-urgent
  └─→ No: Continue

Is it Saturday before 8 PM EST?
  └─→ Yes: Shabbat - no work, provide reading/planning only
  └─→ No: Continue

Is it after 10 PM EST weeknight?
  └─→ Yes: Low energy, suggest defer complex work
  └─→ No: Proceed normally

Is task >90 minutes AND after 8 PM EST?
  └─→ Yes: Suggest start fresh tomorrow AM
  └─→ No: Proceed
```

## Example Usage

```
"What time is it in FL and IL?"
→ 🕐 FL: 10:00 PM EST | IL: 5:00 AM IST

"Can we schedule a call with Israel?"
→ Best time: 8-9 AM EST (3-4 PM IST). Avoid after 3 PM EST (10 PM IST).

"Is now a good time to start this 2-hour task?"
→ It's 10 PM EST (low energy). Better to defer until tomorrow 8-9 AM?
```

## Integration Points

**With ADHD Task Management:**
- Energy levels inform task scheduling
- Evening tasks get defer suggestions
- Morning tasks prioritized

**With Michael D1 Recruiting:**
- Shabbat blocks Friday night/Saturday meets
- Schedule coach calls during business hours FL time

**With Learning Documentation:**
- Log timezone-aware timestamps
- Note energy level during task completion

## Critical Reminders

1. **Shabbat First:** No work Friday sundown → Saturday nightfall
2. **Energy Matters:** Complex tasks before noon EST
3. **7-Hour Difference:** FL + 7 hours = IL time
4. **Michael No Swimming:** Friday night/Saturday competitions prohibited
5. **Show Time Often:** Context helps scheduling decisions
