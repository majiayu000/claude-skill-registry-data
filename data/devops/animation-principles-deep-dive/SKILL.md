# Complete Animation Principles Reference

Comprehensive technical guide to Disney's 12 principles with implementation details.

## 1. Squash and Stretch

**Definition:** Deformation of objects to show flexibility, weight, and motion.

**Technical implementation:**
- Volume must remain constant (area preserved)
- Stretch along motion path at velocity peaks
- Squash perpendicular to impact surface
- Ratio guidelines: 20-50% for cartoony, 5-15% for realistic

**Applications:** Facial expressions, body mechanics, object interactions, impact effects.

## 2. Anticipation

**Definition:** Preparatory action preceding main action.

**Technical implementation:**
- Direction opposite to main action
- Duration proportional to action magnitude
- Typical ratio: 1:3 anticipation to action frames
- Can be minimized for surprise effects

**Applications:** Jumps, throws, emotional shifts, scene transitions.

## 3. Staging

**Definition:** Presentation of idea for maximum clarity.

**Technical implementation:**
- Silhouette test: action readable as solid black shape
- Single focal point per composition
- Background contrast supports subject
- Camera angle serves story point

**Applications:** Every shot, pose choice, camera placement, lighting design.

## 4. Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose

**Definition:** Two fundamental animation approaches.

**Straight ahead:** Sequential frame creation. Organic, spontaneous, harder to control timing.
**Pose to pose:** Key poses first, breakdowns second, inbetweens last. Controlled, plannable, can feel stiff.
**Hybrid:** Keys pose-to-pose, overlapping elements straight ahead.

## 5. Follow Through and Overlapping Action

**Definition:** Continuation of motion after primary action stops.

**Technical implementation:**
- Drag: appendages trail behind main mass
- Follow through: continuation past stop point
- Overlap: different parts move at different rates
- Settle: oscillating return to rest

**Hierarchy:** Root leads, extremities follow. Heavy before light.

## 6. Slow In and Slow Out

**Definition:** Spacing variation showing acceleration/deceleration.

**Technical implementation:**
- Ease in: bunched drawings at motion start
- Ease out: bunched drawings at motion end
- Middle drawings spread apart (fast portion)
- Custom curves for specific effects (bounce, snap, drift)

## 7. Arc

**Definition:** Curved motion paths reflecting natural movement.

**Technical implementation:**
- Track motion paths for all moving elements
- Arcs created by rotation around joints
- Projectiles follow parabolic arcs
- Breaking arcs: mechanical, sudden, intentional effects

## 8. Secondary Action

**Definition:** Actions supporting primary without distracting.

**Technical implementation:**
- Subordinate timing to primary action
- Support emotional content of scene
- Add on separate pass after primary is working
- Remove if it competes for attention

## 9. Timing

**Definition:** Frame count determining speed and weight.

**Reference points:**
- 1-2 frames: instant/invisible
- 4-6 frames: fast/snappy
- 8-12 frames: normal action
- 16-24 frames: slow/heavy
- 24+ frames: very slow/deliberate

Context-dependent: same frame count reads differently based on action type.

## 10. Exaggeration

**Definition:** Amplification of reality for clarity and impact.

**Technical implementation:**
- Identify essence of action/emotion
- Push poses beyond realistic range
- Maintain internal consistency
- Style-appropriate: match project aesthetic

## 11. Solid Drawing

**Definition:** Three-dimensional form and weight in drawings.

**Technical implementation:**
- Consistent volume through motion
- Anatomical understanding (bones, muscles)
- Weight distribution and balance
- Perspective and foreshortening accuracy

## 12. Appeal

**Definition:** Compelling quality that attracts viewer attention.

**Technical implementation:**
- Clear, readable shapes
- Distinctive silhouettes
- Asymmetry in poses and design
- Appropriate complexity level (simple reads faster)

Appeals to: visual interest, emotional connection, design quality.
