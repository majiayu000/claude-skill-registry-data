# Your First Look at Animation Magic

Animation makes drawings move in ways that feel real and fun. Disney animators discovered 12 tricks that make animation look great. Here they are in simple words:

## 1. Squash and Stretch
Things squish when they hit something and stretch when they move fast. Drop a ball - it flattens on the ground, then bounces back round.

## 2. Anticipation
Before a big move, there's a small move the other way. Before jumping up, you crouch down first.

## 3. Staging
Put important things where people will see them. Like putting the main actor in a spotlight on stage.

## 4. Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose
Two ways to draw: either draw every picture in order, or draw the important pictures first and fill in between.

## 5. Follow Through and Overlapping Action
When you stop, your hair keeps moving. Different parts move at different times, not all at once.

## 6. Slow In and Slow Out
Things speed up when starting and slow down when stopping. Like a car at a traffic light.

## 7. Arc
Most things move in curves, not straight lines. Throw a ball - it makes a rainbow shape in the air.

## 8. Secondary Action
Little movements that happen along with the main movement. Walking while whistling and swinging your arms.

## 9. Timing
How fast or slow something happens changes how it feels. Fast = exciting. Slow = calm or heavy.

## 10. Exaggeration
Make things bigger and more dramatic than real life. Cartoon characters can stretch their eyes wide when surprised.

## 11. Solid Drawing
Make flat pictures look like they have weight and depth. Things should feel like you could pick them up.

## 12. Appeal
Make characters interesting to watch. They should have something special that makes you want to keep looking.

## Remember
You don't need to use all 12 at once. Start with one or two. The more you practice, the more natural they become.
