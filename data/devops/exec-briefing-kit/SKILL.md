# Executive Briefing Kit Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing weekly/monthly revenue readouts for ELT/board.
- Translating dense analytics into concise decisions, asks, and risks.
- Coordinating cross-functional follow-ups post-briefing.

## Framework
1. **Story Spine** – headline, context, signal, implication, action.
2. **Metric Snapshot** – top KPIs with delta vs target, YoY, and confidence band.
3. **Focus Risks/Opps** – highlight 3 blockers/opportunities with owners.
4. **Decision Log** – capture exec decisions, escalations, and follow-ups.
5. **Comms Pack** – create slides/memo + Slack/email summary for broader teams.

## Templates
- 3-slide deck outline (headline, KPI spine, action plan).
- Memo template with summary → insights → actions.
- Decision/action log sheet with owner, due date, status.

## Tips
- Lead with actions/asks; park methodology in appendix.
- Include guardrail status inline so execs can quickly assess risk.
- Pair with `revenue-health-dashboard` for visuals and command outputs for deep dives.
