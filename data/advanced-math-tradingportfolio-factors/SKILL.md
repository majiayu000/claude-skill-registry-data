description: Factor modeling and portfolio construction (Markowitz, Black-Litterman, constraints, turnover).

# What this covers
- Factor models, mean-variance, BL, turnover/constraints, links to advanced optimization examples.

# Navigation (load on demand)
- docs/knowledge-base/domains/foundations/advanced-mathematics/factor-models.md
- docs/knowledge-base/domains/foundations/advanced-mathematics/mean-variance-optimization-markowitz.md
- docs/knowledge-base/domains/foundations/advanced-mathematics/black-litterman-model.md
- Relevant sections in docs/knowledge-base/domains/foundations/advanced-mathematics/advanced-optimization.md (MOO, MIP).

# Quick workflows
- Build factor portfolio → factor-models + Markowitz.
- BL prior/posterior setup → Black-Litterman MD.
- Add cardinality/turnover → reuse MOO/MIP from advanced-optimization.

# Notes
- Keep loads targeted to the needed construction.
