# Lead Qualifier

Transform raw leads into prioritized opportunities with systematic qualification. This skill applies proven frameworks like BANT, MEDDIC, and CHAMP to evaluate leads objectively, ensuring your sales team focuses on prospects most likely to convert.

Stop wasting time on tire-kickers and unqualified prospects. This skill helps you build scoring models, create qualification criteria, and develop consistent processes for evaluating fit, budget, authority, and timing. The result: shorter sales cycles, higher close rates, and more efficient resource allocation.

Ideal for sales teams, SDRs, account executives, and anyone who needs to separate high-potential opportunities from noise.

## Best Practices

- **Define ICP first** - Know your ideal customer before qualifying anyone
- **Use multiple frameworks** - BANT for quick screen, MEDDIC for complex deals
- **Weight recency** - Recent engagement matters more than old activity
- **Include negative criteria** - Define what disqualifies as clearly as what qualifies
- **Automate where possible** - Let technology handle initial scoring
- **Calibrate regularly** - Compare predicted vs. actual conversions monthly
- **Document reasoning** - Record why leads are qualified/disqualified
- **Set clear thresholds** - Specific scores trigger specific actions
- **Train consistently** - Everyone should score leads the same way
- **Measure outcomes** - Track which qualified leads actually closed
- **Consider timing** - Right solution, wrong time still means nurture
- **Map buying committee** - Qualify the deal, not just the contact
- **Listen for pain** - No pain = no urgency = no deal
- **Validate budget early** - Don't invest in opportunities without resources
- **Create feedback loops** - Sales insights should refine marketing's scoring
