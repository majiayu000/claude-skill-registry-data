# Weekly Review Standards

## Purpose
To maintain system health, clear the backlog, and set strategic goals for the upcoming week.

## The Review Process (GTD Style)
1.  **Clear**: Process `00_Inbox` until empty (Archive, Delete, or Move).
2.  **Current**: Review `10_Projects` active status.
3.  **Creative**: Synthesize findings into the Weekly Note.

## Review Quality
- **Data Driven**: Don't just "remember". Use file modification logs (`list_dir`) to see what actually happened.
- **Action Oriented**: Extract incomplete tasks (`- [ ]`) and explicitly reschedule them.
