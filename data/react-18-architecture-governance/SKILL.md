# React 18 Architecture Governance

## Summary

Establish governance models for large React 18 codebases to preserve architectural integrity.

## Key Capabilities

- Define enforceable architectural rules and ownership boundaries.
- Implement automated dependency checks and policy gates.
- Design evolution pathways without breaking API stability.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Formalize a constraint system for architecture drift detection.
- Quantify entropy reduction from governance practices.
- Model the impact of governance on delivery velocity.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Provide governance rules and enforcement tooling.
- Demonstrate detection and remediation of violations.
- Include metrics on drift reduction.
