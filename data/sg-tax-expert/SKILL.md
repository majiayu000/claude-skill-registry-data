   - Optimize: Pay enough salary for CPF, remainder as dividends

2. **Director's Fees**
   - Taxable in year of approval (not payment)
   - Defer approval to next year if beneficial

3. **SRS Contributions**
   - $15,300/year (citizens/PRs), $35,700 (foreigners)
   - Reduces taxable income now, 50% taxable on withdrawal at retirement

4. **Timing Income**
   - Bonuses: Control approval date to shift between tax years
   - Consulting income: Invoice timing matters

   - B2C: 9% impacts competitiveness

3. **Export-Heavy Business**
