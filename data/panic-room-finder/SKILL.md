├── Thick walls with potential voids
├── Servants' quarters/passages

LARGE ESTATES:

├── Basement vault rooms
└── Tunnel systems to outbuildings

URBAN ROWHOUSES:
├── Shared wall anomalies
├── Basement connections

└── Back stair hiding spaces

SUBURBAN HOMES:
├── Basement safe rooms
├── Under-stair storage (deeper than expected)
├── Garage hidden compartments
├── Attic access panels to hidden space
└── Crawl space extensions
```

## The Mapping Process

### Step 1: Gather Documentation

```
DOCUMENTS TO FIND:
├── Original blueprints (check county records)
├── Building permits (all renovations)
├── Survey maps (property lines, structures)
├── Previous listing photos (real estate archives)
├── Insurance inspection records
└── Historical society records (for older homes)

WHERE TO LOOK:
├── County recorder's office
├── Local building department
├── Historical society
├── Previous owner records
├── Original builder/architect (if known)
└── Realtor's historical files
```

### Step 2: Room-by-Room Measurement

```
MEASURING PROTOCOL:

TOOLS NEEDED:
├── Laser distance measurer (highly recommended)
├── Standard tape measure (backup)
├── Graph paper (1/4" grid)
├── Smartphone (photos, notes)
└── Level (for checking true walls)

MEASUREMENT APPROACH:
├── Start from exterior walls (measure outside perimeter)
├── Measure each room interior
├── Measure wall thicknesses at doorways
├── Note ceiling heights per room
├── Measure closet depths especially
└── Record unusual features (alcoves, bumps, niches)

FORMULA:
Exterior perimeter area MINUS sum of interior room areas
= Total wall/void space

If this number is significantly larger than expected
for wall thickness (typically 4-8" per wall),
you may have hidden space.
```

### Step 3: Floor-to-Floor Analysis

```
VERTICAL DISCREPANCIES:

Check for:
├── Floor height differences between rooms
├── Ceiling height vs. floor above
├── Stair landing positions vs. expected floor levels
├── Basement ceiling vs. first floor
└── Attic floor vs. rooms below

RED FLAGS:
├── "Lost" height between floors (2+ feet unexplained)
├── Stairs that should arrive somewhere but don't
├── Rooms that are shorter than adjacent rooms
├── Attic space that doesn't extend over whole house
└── Basement that doesn't extend under entire first floor
```

## Identifying Anomalies

### Visual Indicators

```
WALL CLUES:
├── Wall that sounds different when knocked (hollow vs. solid)
├── Trim or molding that doesn't match rest of house
├── Paint that doesn't quite match (newer patch)
├── Outlet plates at unusual heights
├── Baseboards that don't align with rest of room
├── Wallpaper seams in unexpected places
└── Door that opens to unexpected small space

FLOOR CLUES:
├── Flooring that doesn't match pattern
├── Areas that sound hollow when walked on
├── Unusual wear patterns to non-functional spot
├── Carpeting that's newer in one section
├── Floor register that doesn't connect to HVAC
└── Trapdoor-like cuts in hardwood

CEILING CLUES:
├── Attic access panels in unusual locations
├── Ceiling height changes within room
├── Crown molding that stops unexpectedly
├── Light fixtures in odd positions
├── Texture changes in ceiling
└── Evidence of patched openings
```

### Mechanical Indicators

```
THINGS THAT MIGHT BE TRIGGERS:
├── Bookcases that seem heavier than expected
├── Wall sconces that don't work
├── Decorative panels that seem functional
├── Built-in cabinets with unusual depth
├── Fireplaces with odd proportions
├── Mirror frames that seem attached unusually
├── Light switches that don't control anything
└── Door frames with hidden hinges

COMMON HIDDEN DOOR MECHANISMS:
├── Push-release latches (push to open)
├── Hidden lever in adjacent object
├── Magnetic releases (strong magnet needed)
├── Remote control systems
├── Biometric locks (newer)
├── Book-pull releases (classic)
└── Light switch combinations
```

## Non-Destructive Investigation

### Acoustic Testing

```
THE KNOCK TEST:

1. Use knuckle or small rubber mallet
2. Knock systematically across wall surface
3. Listen for changes in sound:
   ├── Solid: dull thud
   ├── Stud: slightly different thud (every 16")
   ├── Hollow: distinct hollow sound
   └── Void: VERY hollow, almost drum-like

4. Mark suspicious areas with painter's tape
5. Map the hollow-sounding zones
6. Compare to expected wall construction
```

### Electronic Detection

```
STUD FINDER (with limitations):
├── Can detect studs and sometimes wires
├── May show unusual spacing or gaps
├── Deep-scanning models better for this
└── Won't reveal what's in a void

THERMAL CAMERA:
├── May show temperature differences
├── Hidden rooms might be unconditioned (different temp)
├── Can reveal hidden ductwork or lack thereof
└── Smartphone attachments available (FLIR, etc.)

BORESCOPE/ENDOSCOPE:
├── Tiny camera on flexible cable
├── Insert through small drilled hole
├── See inside wall cavity
├── $20-100 USB versions work for most uses
├── Only use if you're VERY confident there's something
└── CAREFUL: This is minimally destructive

MOISTURE METER:
├── Can detect unusual moisture patterns
├── Hidden rooms without HVAC may be damper
├── Also useful for finding water damage
```

### Visual Inspection Points

```
CHECK THESE ACCESS POINTS:
├── Attic: look for unused space, false floors
├── Basement: look for unusual walls, false ceilings
├── Utility closets: often hide access
├── Under stairs: classic hiding spot
├── Walk-in closets: check depth vs. adjacent room
├── Behind large mirrors: especially built-ins
└── Inside large cabinets: check for false backs
```

## Safe Opening Procedures

### When You Find a Hidden Space

```
BEFORE OPENING:

1. ASSESS SAFETY
   ├── Is the structure sound?
   ├── Any signs of current use? (fresh locks, etc.)
   ├── Any electrical/utility concerns?
   └── Any reason to involve professionals?

2. DOCUMENT
   ├── Photo everything before touching
   ├── Note the mechanism details
   ├── Record location precisely
   └── Video the opening process

3. VENTILATION CHECK
   ├── Sealed spaces may have poor air
   ├── Have someone with you
   ├── Open slowly, let air exchange
   └── Don't enter immediately if sealed for long time

4. PROCEED CAREFULLY
   ├── Use flashlight first (don't enter)
   ├── Check for stability of floor/structure
   ├── Look for animal/pest evidence
   └── No rushing—this space isn't going anywhere
```

### What You Might Find

```
COMMON DISCOVERIES:
├── Empty space (most common)
├── Old storage (forgotten items)
├── Previous owner's hidden stash
├── Historical artifacts
├── Old newspapers/letters (insulation era)
├── Evidence of previous use (Prohibition, WWII)
├── Animal nests (abandoned space)
└── Outdated utility equipment

RARE BUT POSSIBLE:
├── Valuable items left behind
├── Historical significance
├── Structural concerns (why it was sealed)
└── Evidence of concerning activity (call authorities)

IF YOU FIND ANYTHING CONCERNING:
├── Do not disturb
├── Document with photos
├── Contact appropriate authorities
└── Wait for professional guidance
```

## Converting to a Safe Room

### If You Want to Create a Panic Room

```
IDEAL SAFE ROOM FEATURES:
├── Solid core door (or reinforced)
├── Door frame reinforcement
├── Secondary lock system (interior)
├── Communication (cell phone, landline, intercom)
├── Emergency supplies (water, first aid)
├── Battery backup for lights
├── Ventilation (passive or emergency)
└── Comfortable waiting capacity

LOCATION PRIORITIES:
├── Near bedrooms (accessible during home invasion)
├── Cell phone signal availability
├── Away from exterior walls (if possible)
├── Not obvious location (closet within bedroom)
└── Accessible to all family members

DIY VS. PROFESSIONAL:
├── Basic: reinforced closet (DIY possible)
├── Moderate: dedicated room conversion (contractor)
├── Advanced: purpose-built room (security specialist)
└── Always consult local building codes
```

## Anti-Patterns

### "Knocking Is Enough"
**Wrong**: Only doing the knock test and concluding.
**Why**: Many factors affect wall sound; need multiple methods.
**Right**: Combine knock test + measurements + visual inspection.

### "Breaking Through"
**Wrong**: Making holes to investigate.
**Why**: Destructive, may damage hidden room, hard to repair.
**Right**: Use borescope only after exhausting other methods.

### "Ignoring Safety"
**Wrong**: Entering a sealed space immediately.
**Why**: Air quality, structural stability, unknown hazards.
**Right**: Ventilate, document, assess before entering.

### "Not Documenting"
**Wrong**: Just exploring without recording.
**Why**: You may forget details, lose evidence of discovery.
**Right**: Photos, videos, measurements before and during.

**Core Philosophy**: Hidden spaces tell stories. Whether your house was a stop on the Underground Railroad, a Prohibition speakeasy, or just had an eccentric previous owner, the architecture remembers. Your job is to be a detective—patient, methodical, and respectful of what you might find.

Every hollow knock is a question. Take your time finding the answers.
