## What I do
- Create comprehensive epics using beads hierarchical task structure
- Break large features into manageable tasks and sub-tasks
- Maintain epic progress tracking and completion metrics
- Provide epic-level reporting and milestone tracking
- Handle epic dependencies and cross-team coordination

## When to use me
Use when you need to:
- Create epics for large feature sets or product areas
- Break down complex features into hierarchical task structures
- Track progress across multiple related tasks
- Manage cross-functional epics involving multiple teams
- Plan long-term feature development with proper hierarchy
- Coordinate epic releases and milestone completion

## How I work
1. **Epic Definition** - Define epic scope, objectives, and success criteria
2. **Hierarchical Breakdown** - Create bead-style task hierarchy (epic → task → sub-task)
3. **Task Assignment** - Assign tasks to team members and time periods
4. **Dependency Management** - Handle cross-task and cross-epic dependencies
5. **Progress Tracking** - Monitor epic completion and milestone progress
6. **Resource Planning** - Optimize team allocation across epic tasks
7. **Milestone Integration** - Connect epic progress to project milestones

## What I need
- Feature requirements or product objectives
- Team composition and availability information
- Timeline and milestone requirements
- Existing tasks or epic definitions
- Cross-team coordination requirements
- Resource constraints and dependencies

## What I produce
Comprehensive epic management outputs:
- **Epic Structure** - Complete hierarchical task breakdown with bead IDs
- **Task Hierarchies** - Epic → Tasks → Sub-tasks with proper relationships
- **Progress Tracking** - Epic-level progress metrics and completion status
- **Milestone Alignment** - Epic tasks mapped to project milestones
- **Resource Planning** - Team assignments optimized for epic execution
- **Dependency Maps** - Cross-epic dependency visualization
- **Risk Assessment** - Epic-level risk identification and mitigation
- **Reporting Dashboards** - Epic progress and team performance metrics
- **Release Planning** - Epic completion timing and release coordination

## Usage Example
```
"Create an epic for user authentication with proper task hierarchy and team assignments"
```

This will generate a complete epic with hierarchical tasks, team assignments, and progress tracking using beads structure.

## Epic Management Features
- **Hierarchical Structure** - Epic ID → Task ID → Sub-task ID with bead naming
- **Progress Aggregation** - Automatic epic progress calculation from child tasks
- **Team Coordination** - Multi-team epic management with clear ownership
- **Milestone Tracking** - Epic completion tied to project milestones
- **Dependency Management** - Cross-epic dependencies and blockers
- **Resource Optimization** - Team allocation across epic task hierarchy
- **Risk Assessment** - Epic-level risk identification and mitigation
- **Release Planning** - Coordinated epic release timing and dependencies
- **Reporting Integration** - Epic dashboards and stakeholder communication
