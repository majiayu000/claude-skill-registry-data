## Who is the Cd?

Cd types are skeptical, independent, and logical. They combine analytical precision with assertive questioning -- challenging assumptions and driving toward truth through rigorous analysis. They refuse to accept things at face value, demand evidence, and aren't afraid to challenge authority when they see logical flaws. Their skepticism isn't cynicism; it's a tool for uncovering truth and protecting against flawed decisions.

## Do's

- Come prepared with data and evidence to support your points
- Be direct and get to the point quickly
- Welcome their probing questions rather than getting defensive
- Focus on logic and facts in your arguments
- Respect their need for independent thinking and autonomy
- Acknowledge their critical contributions and analytical rigor
- Anticipate their questions and address them proactively
- Be willing to admit when they raise a valid point

## Don'ts

- Don't take their questioning personally -- they challenge everything
- Don't make unsupported claims or use vague language
- Don't rely on emotional appeals instead of evidence
- Don't ask them to accept things on faith or authority alone
- Don't force unnecessary small talk or social pleasantries
- Don't get defensive when they poke holes in your argument
- Don't expect them to sugarcoat their feedback
- Don't dismiss their skepticism as negativity -- it prevents real mistakes

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Come prepared with data and evidence. Expect probing questions and don't take them personally. Be direct, get to the point quickly, and be ready to defend your conclusions logically. They respect people who can withstand their questioning and hold their ground with solid reasoning.

### Email
Be concise and fact-based. Include supporting evidence for any claims you make. Anticipate their questions and address them proactively. Avoid fluff, unnecessary pleasantries, or filler -- they'll skim past it anyway and may lose respect for the padding.

### Giving Feedback
Be direct and specific with evidence. Focus on logic rather than feelings. Acknowledge their critical contributions before addressing areas for improvement, and be prepared for follow-up questions about your feedback. They'll want to understand the reasoning behind it.

### Resolving Conflict
Stick to facts and logical arguments. Don't get emotional or defensive. Be willing to admit when they have a valid point, and focus on solving the problem together. They respect people who engage honestly rather than retreating behind authority or emotion.
