## Character Design Principles

### Rock-Paper-Scissors

Every character should have:
- **Strengths** - Situations where they excel
- **Weaknesses** - Situations where they struggle
- **Counters** - Specific hard counters

### Clear Fantasy

Each character should embody:
- **An identity** - "I am the..." statement
- **A fantasy** - Power trip or fantasy fulfillment
- **A moment** - When this character shines

### Accessibility

Characters should be:
- **Easy to learn** - Basic understanding in minutes
- **Hard to master** - Skill ceiling for dedicated players
- **Distinct** - No overlap with other characters

## Class Types

### Offensive

Focused on dealing damage:
- High damage output
- Low survivability
- Skill-based positioning

### Defensive

Focused on protection and support:
- High health/armor
- Team utility
- Low damage output

### Support

Focused on helping team:
- Healing/buffing
- Utility and control
- Resource generation

### Hybrid

Mixed capabilities:
- Multiple roles
- Flexibility
- Jack of all trades, master of none

## Balance Considerations

### Statistical Balance

Ensure characters are numerically balanced:

| Aspect | Considerations |
|--------|---------------|
| DPS | Damage per second across time |
| TTK | Time to kill average opponent |
| Survivability | Time to die under fire |
| Utility | Value added to team |

### Skill Expression

Ensure skill matters:
- Low floor - New players can contribute
- High ceiling - Experts can outplay basics
- Multiple techniques - Different playstyles
- Outplay potential - Can beat stronger opponents

### Team Balance

For team-based games:
- No mandatory character
- No trap characters
- Multiple viable compositions
- Each character has a role
