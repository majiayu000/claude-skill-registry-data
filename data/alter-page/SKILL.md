# ALTER PAGE / ALTER SNIPPET - Modify Existing Pages and Snippets

## Overview

ALTER PAGE and ALTER SNIPPET modify an existing page or snippet's widget tree **in-place** without requiring a full `create or modify`. Operations work directly on the raw BSON tree, preserving widget types and properties that MDL doesn't explicitly model.

## When to Use

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Change a button caption, label, or style | `alter page` with `set` |
| Add a field to an existing form | `alter page` with `insert` |
| Remove unused widgets | `alter page` with `drop` |
| Replace a footer or section | `alter page` with `replace` |
| Several related changes on the same page | `alter page` with multiple operations in one block |
| Same property across many pages (e.g., add `Class` to every Container) | `update widgets` — see `bulk-widget-updates` |
| Rebuild entire page from scratch (pages your scripts own only) | `create or modify page` |
| Create a new page | `create page` |

**Rule of thumb:**
- `alter page` — targeted edits to one page. Combine multiple ops in one block when they belong together.
- `update widgets` — cross-page bulk updates with `WHERE` filtering and `DRY RUN`.
- `create or modify page` — redefining the full page structure of a page your MDL scripts own.

**Who owns the page decides** ([choose-edit-mode](../choose-edit-mode/SKILL.md)). A page
or snippet authored or edited in Studio Pro is changed with `alter`, however large the
change. `describe` → edit → `create or modify` is only for pages your
MDL scripts created and nobody has changed in Studio Pro since: on a Studio Pro page that
round trip has dropped translations and filled an empty English caption from another
language, and on a snippet it has dropped the snippet's type.

## Syntax

```sql
alter page Module.PageName {
  operation1;
  operation2;
  ...
};

alter snippet Module.SnippetName {
  operation1;
  operation2;
  ...
};
```

This is the **generic ALTER** — the same four verbs for every document type
(`alter layout` too):

```sql
alter page Module.PageName {
  set (Key: value, …) on <target>;      -- no `on`: the page itself
  insert before|after|into <target> { <widgets as in create page> }
  replace <target> with { <widgets> }
  drop <target>, <target>;
};
```

A `<target>` on a page is a widget name, a DataGrid 2 column `grid column(Attr)`
(or `grid column('Caption')`), or a layout region `layoutContainer.top`. Properties go in parentheses with `:`, exactly as in
`create page`. The older spellings `set Key = value on w`, `set Key: value`
(no parentheses) and `drop widget w` still run, and warn with MDL-DEPR101,
MDL-DEPR102 and MDL-DEPR103 — write the form above.

Multiple operations can be combined in a single ALTER statement. They are applied sequentially; later operations see the page state produced by earlier ones, so you can `set` on a widget you just `insert`ed.

```sql
mdl 1;
-- Rename a column, add a sibling, drop an obsolete one — all in one block.
alter page MyMod.Product_Overview {
  set (caption: 'Product Name') on dgProducts column(Name);
  insert after dgProducts column(Lifecycle) {
    column (attribute: Sku, caption: 'SKU')
  };
  drop dgProducts column('Old')
};
```

For changes that should be applied across **many pages** (e.g., "add `Class='card'` to every Container in `MyMod`"), use `UPDATE WIDGETS` instead — see `bulk-widget-updates`.

## Operations

### List View Specialization Templates

A List View template has no name, so it cannot be reached by a widget ref like
every other target. Adding one reuses `INSERT INTO` with the same
`template for` block `create page` uses — a template has one spelling
everywhere. Removing one has its own form:

```sql
mdl 1;
alter page Pages.Vehicle_Overview {
  insert into vehicleListView {
    template for Pages.Motorcycle {
      dynamictext mcLabel (content: 'Motorcycle {1}', contentparams: ({1} = Brand))
    }
  };
  drop template for Pages.SUV in vehicleListView
};
```

Naming the list view in the `drop` is required, not optional: one page can hold
two list views with a template for the same entity.

Most template edits need none of this. The widgets **inside** a template are
ordinary named widgets, so `set (content: '…') on busLabel` and
`insert after busLabel { … }` already work and land in the right template. To
replace a whole template, `drop` it and `insert` the new one in the same block —
operations apply in order.

Refused, each naming the problem:

- `insert before` / `insert after` a template — templates are not siblings of the
  widgets in the list view's body, so only `insert into` makes sense.
- mixing `template for …` blocks with ordinary widgets in one `insert` — they go
  to different places (the Templates array and the default body). Use two inserts.
- a template for an entity that is not the list view's entity or a specialization
  of it — it could never match an object the list view shows.
- a second template for an entity that already has one.
- `drop template for` an entity with no template — the error names the ones that
  are there, because dropping nothing and reporting success is how a typo becomes
  a silent no-op.

### SET - Modify Widget Properties

```sql
-- Single property
set (caption: 'New Caption') on widgetName

-- Multiple properties
set (caption: 'Save & Close', buttonstyle: success) on btnSave

-- Page-level property (no ON clause). Page-level property names are
-- case-sensitive and must match the Mendix property exactly.
set (Title: 'New Page Title')

-- Pop-up dimensions (apply when the page is opened in a pop-up)
set (PopupWidth: 800)
set (PopupHeight: 480)
set (PopupResizable: true)
set (Documentation: 'What this page is for.')

-- Retarget a button's on-click action. Any form `create page` accepts works
-- here, including the combined ones.
set (Action: call microflow Module.ACT_Other) on btnSave
set (Action: SAVE CHANGES CLOSE PAGE) on btnSave
set (Action: SHOW PAGE Module.DetailPage) on btnEdit

-- Retarget ONE named action slot of a pluggable widget, by the widget's own
-- property key (the same key `create page` takes: `createFileAction: …`).
set ('createFileAction': call microflow Module.ACT_CreateFile) on fileUploader1
set ('onSelectionChange': show page Module.Detail) on dgOrders

-- Rebind a data-bound widget
set (DataSource: $OrderParam) on dvOrder
set (DataSource: microflow Module.MF_Get) on dvOrder
```

**Prefer `set Action` over `replace` when only the action changes.** `replace`
rebuilds the widget from what the statement says, so any property you do not
restate — `ButtonStyle`, `Class`, design properties, tooltip — is dropped. `set`
edits the one property and leaves the rest of the widget alone.

The exception is a **pluggable widget replaced by one of the same kind** (a combo
box by a combo box): there `replace` keeps every stored property the statement
does not change — a translated placeholder, `readOnlyStyle`, anything MDL has no
word for — and writes only what differs from the widget as `describe` prints it.
So a sort can be added to a combo box's options by restating its `describe`
line with `sort by` appended.

`set Action` is refused on a widget that has no action (a plain container, say),
rather than writing a property the widget type does not define — Studio Pro
refuses to open a document with an unknown property while MxBuild tolerates it,
so a silent write would build cleanly and then fail to open.

**Supported SET properties:**

| Property | Widget Types | Value Type | Example |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| `Action` | Widgets with an on-click action (ACTIONBUTTON, LINKBUTTON, clickable containers) | Any `create page` action expression | `set (Action: call microflow M.ACT_Go) on btnSave` |
| `'<slotKey>'` | Pluggable widgets — any **action-typed** property (File Uploader `createFileAction`, DataGrid 2 `onSelectionChange`, …) | Any `create page` action expression | `set ('createFileAction': call microflow M.ACT_Create) on fileUploader1` — refused, naming the widget's action slots, if the key is not action-typed |
| `caption` | ACTIONBUTTON, LINKBUTTON | String | `set (caption: 'Submit') on btnSave` |
| `content` | DYNAMICTEXT | String | `set (content: 'New Heading') on txtTitle` |
| `label` | TEXTBOX, TEXTAREA, DATEPICKER, COMBOBOX, CHECKBOX, RADIOBUTTONS | String | `set (label: 'full Name') on txtName` |
| `buttonstyle` | ACTIONBUTTON, LINKBUTTON | Primary, Default, Success, Danger, Warning, Info | `set (buttonstyle: danger) on btnDelete` |
| `class` | Any widget | CSS class string | `set (class: 'card mx-2') on container1` |
| `style` | Any widget (see warning below) | Inline CSS string | `set (style: 'padding: 16px;') on container1` |
| `editable` | Input widgets | String | `set (editable: 'Never') on txtReadOnly` |
| `visible` | Any widget | String or Boolean | `set (visible: false) on txtHidden` |
| `Name` | Any widget | String | `set (Name: 'newName') on oldName` |
| `Title` | Page-level only (case-sensitive) | String | `set (Title: 'Edit Customer')` |
| `Documentation` | Page-level only (case-sensitive) | String (`''` clears) | `set (Documentation: 'Coordinator triage step.')` |
| `layout` | Page-level only | Qualified name | `set layout = Atlas_Core.Atlas_Default` |
| `PopupWidth` | Page-level only (case-sensitive) | Positive integer (pixels) | `set (PopupWidth: 800)` |
| `PopupHeight` | Page-level only (case-sensitive) | Positive integer (pixels) | `set (PopupHeight: 480)` |
| `PopupResizable` | Page-level only (case-sensitive) | Boolean | `set (PopupResizable: true)` |
| `Class` | Page-level (case-sensitive, no ON) | CSS class string | `set (Class: 'container-fluid bg-light')` |
| `Style` | Page-level (case-sensitive, no ON) | Inline CSS string | `set (Style: 'min-height: 100vh')` |
| `Visible` (conditional) | Any widget | expression | `set (Visible: $currentObject/Name != '') on ctnDetails` |
| `Editable` (conditional) | Input widgets | expression | `set (Editable: $currentObject/Active) on txtName` |
| `'quotedProp'` | Pluggable widgets | String, Boolean, Number | `set ('showLabel': false) on cbStatus` |

> **Conditional visibility/editability** — `set (Visible: <expr>) on widget` (and
> `Editable`) attach a per-object client expression, stored as written: name
> attributes as `$currentObject/Name`. The bracketed `set (Visible: [Name != ''])`,
> which roots a bare attribute for you, still works and warns MDL-DEPR081. Setting
> `Editable` on a non-input widget is rejected. This mirrors CREATE PAGE's
> `visible:` — see the create-page skill for enum-value rules.

**Pluggable widget properties** use quoted names to set values in the widget's `Object.Properties[]`. Boolean values are stored as `"yes"`/`"no"` in BSON.

**Column property names are case-insensitive** in MDL — `set (caption: …)` and `set (Caption: …)` both work. The internal BSON keys are dictated by the widget schema and stay case-sensitive on the storage side.

> **Warning: Style on DYNAMICTEXT** — Setting `style` directly on a DYNAMICTEXT widget crashes MxBuild with a NullReferenceException. Wrap the DYNAMICTEXT in a CONTAINER and apply styling to the container instead:
> ```sql
> -- Wrong: crashes MxBuild
> SET (Style: 'color: red;') ON txtHeading
>
> -- Correct: style the container
> REPLACE txtHeading WITH {
>   CONTAINER ctnHeading (Style: 'color: red;') {
>     DYNAMICTEXT txtHeading (Content: 'Heading', RenderMode: H2)
>   }
> }
> ```

#### Changing a widget's DataSource

`SET DataSource` retypes a data source in place — including across shapes, e.g.
from a microflow to a page parameter:

```sql
mdl 1;
ALTER PAGE MyModule.OrderPage {
  SET (DataSource: $Order) ON dvOrder;                       -- page/snippet parameter
  SET (DataSource: microflow MyModule.MF_Get) ON dvOrder;     -- microflow
  SET (DataSource: nanoflow MyModule.NF_Get) ON dvOrder;      -- nanoflow
  SET (DataSource: selection dgOrders) ON dvDetail;           -- listen to widget
};
```

The parameter must exist on the page (or snippet) being altered — its entity is
read from the container's own parameter list, and an unknown name is refused
rather than written as an unresolved reference.

`association` and `database` sources are **not** supported by SET. Use REPLACE
for those, which rebuilds the widget through the CREATE PAGE path and handles
every datasource type; the error message says so.

A `database` source has no single stored shape — the widget holding it decides
which element Mendix writes (a list view, a data grid and a pluggable widget
each store a different one), and SET writes the property directly rather than
rebuilding the widget, so it has nothing to choose from. This used to be
accepted and half-applied: the widget was left with a source that DESCRIBE read
back as absent and mxbuild rejected as **CE7007**, on a page `exec` had just
reported as altered (mendixlabs/mxcli#1032).

A **data view** is the one case REPLACE does not rescue: it binds to a single
object, so Mendix gives it no database form at all and the CREATE PAGE path
refuses one too. Point it at a context parameter, a microflow, a nanoflow or
`selection <widget>`, and use a list view or a data grid to show a query. The
refusal says which of the two situations you are in.

### INSERT - Add Widgets

```sql
-- Insert after a widget
insert after txtName {
  textbox txtMiddleName (label: 'Middle Name', attribute: MiddleName)
}

-- Insert before a widget
insert before btnSave {
  actionbutton btnPreview (caption: 'Preview', action: call microflow Module.ACT_Preview)
}

-- Insert INTO a container — append as its last child (works on an EMPTY container)
insert into ctnToolbar {
  actionbutton btnNew (caption: 'New', action: nothing, buttonstyle: primary)
}
```

Inserted widgets use the same syntax as `create page`. Multiple widgets can be inserted in a single block.

`insert into <container>` appends as the last child of the named container — the
only way to fill an **empty** container, and handy for adding to a container/dataview
without needing a sibling to anchor to. Widgets inserted into a dataview take that
dataview's entity as their context. Supported on simple containers (container,
dataview, groupbox, scroll-container region); for a layout grid or tab container,
insert relative to a widget inside the target column/tab instead.

**The context comes from the nearest enclosing data source, whatever kind it is**
— a database or association source, a microflow/nanoflow source (the entity is
the flow's return type), or `datasource: selection <list>`, which takes the
entity of the list it listens to. A bare attribute in the inserted or replaced
widget resolves against that entity, exactly as it would in `create page`. When
no enclosing source can be resolved, the binding is written unset rather than
guessed at — `describe page` then prints `<unbound>`, and mxbuild reports
`CE0402 "No value specified."`, so re-describe the page after an ALTER that
moves data-bound widgets.

### DROP - Remove Widgets

```sql
-- Drop a single widget
drop txtUnused

-- Drop multiple widgets
drop txtOldField, lblOldLabel, container2
```

Removes widgets and their entire subtree from the page.

### REPLACE - Replace Widget Subtree

```sql
mdl 1;
-- Replace a data view's footer (it has no name: address it by its data view)
alter page MyModule.Customer_Edit {
  replace dvMain.footer with {
    footer {
      actionbutton btnSave (caption: 'Save', action: save changes, buttonstyle: primary)
      actionbutton btnCancel (caption: 'Cancel', action: cancel changes)
    }
  }
};
```

Replaces the target widget with one or more new widgets. The new widgets use the same syntax as `create page`, and may reuse the names of the widgets the replace removes. `insert into dvMain.footer { … }` appends to a footer and `drop dvMain.footer` empties it.

### DataGrid Column Operations

A DataGrid 2 column is addressed by what `describe page` prints in it: `grid column(Attr)` for its `attribute:`, `grid column('Caption')` for its `caption:`. See "DataGrid 2 columns: how to address them" below.

```sql
-- SET a column property
set (caption: 'Product SKU') on dgProducts column(Code)

-- DROP a column
drop dgProducts column('Old column')

-- INSERT a column after an existing one
insert after dgProducts column(Price) {
  column (attribute: Margin, caption: 'Margin')
}

-- REPLACE a column
replace dgProducts column(Description) with {
  column (attribute: Notes, caption: 'Notes')
}

-- Two columns over one attribute: pick one with @n
drop dgProducts column(Name)@2
```

The older dotted form `gridName.columnName` still works; it matches a name mxcli derives (the short attribute name, else the sanitized caption, else `colN`).

### ADD Variables - Add a Page Variable

```sql
add variables $showStockColumn: boolean = 'true'
```

Adds a new page variable (`Forms$LocalVariable`) to the page/snippet. DataType can be `boolean`, `string`, `integer`, `decimal`, `datetime`, or an entity type. Default value is a Mendix expression in single quotes.

### DROP Variables - Remove a Page Variable

```sql
drop variables $showStockColumn
```

Removes a page variable by name.

### SET Layout - Change Page Layout

```sql
-- Auto-map placeholders by name (most common case)
set layout = Atlas_Core.Atlas_Default

-- Explicit mapping when placeholder names differ
set layout = Atlas_Core.Atlas_SideBar map (Main as content, Extra as Sidebar)
```

Changes the page's layout without rebuilding the widget tree. Only rewrites the `FormCall.Form` and `FormCall.Arguments[].Parameter` BSON fields — all widget content is preserved. Not supported for snippets.

When placeholders have the same names in both layouts (e.g., both have `Main`), auto-mapping works. Use `map` when placeholder names differ between the old and new layout.

## Examples

### Change button text and style

```sql
mdl 1;
alter page MyModule.Customer_Edit {
  set (caption: 'Save & Close', buttonstyle: success) on btnSave
};
```

### Add a field to a form

```sql
mdl 1;
alter page MyModule.Customer_Edit {
  insert after txtEmail {
    textbox txtPhone (label: 'Phone', attribute: Phone)
  }
};
```

### Add a page variable for column visibility

```sql
mdl 1;
alter page MyModule.ProductOverview {
  add variables $showStockColumn: boolean = 'if (3 < 4) then true else false'
};
```

### Remove unused fields and update title

```sql
mdl 1;
alter page MyModule.Customer_Edit {
  set (title: 'Edit Customer Details');
  drop txtLegacyField, lblOldNote;
  set (label: 'Email Address') on txtEmail
};
```

### Replace a footer section

```sql
mdl 1;
alter page MyModule.Customer_Edit {
  replace dvMain.footer with {
    footer {
      actionbutton btnSave (caption: 'Save', action: save changes, buttonstyle: success)
      actionbutton btnDelete (caption: 'Delete', action: delete, buttonstyle: danger)
      actionbutton btnCancel (caption: 'Cancel', action: cancel changes)
    }
  }
};
```

### Modify a snippet

```sql
mdl 1;
alter snippet MyModule.NavigationMenu {
  set (caption: 'Dashboard') on btnHome;
  insert after btnHome {
    actionbutton btnReports (caption: 'Reports', action: show page MyModule.Reports_Overview)
  }
};
```

### Set pluggable widget properties

```sql
mdl 1;
alter page MyModule.Customer_Edit {
  set ('showLabel': false) on cbStatus;
  set ('labelWidth': 4) on cbCategory
};
```

## DataGrid 2 columns: how to address them, and what you can set

**Mendix stores no column name.** A DataGrid 2 column's schema has no name or
identifier key — the only human-facing label is its caption — so a column is
written without one, and `describe page` prints none:

```mdl
create or modify page Mod.P (...) {
  datagrid dg1 (datasource: database Mod.Item) {
    column (attribute: Label, caption: 'The Label')
    column (caption: 'Actions', ShowContentAs: customContent) { … }
  }
};
```

A name written there anyway (`column colLabel (…)`, the old describe output) is
dropped and reported as **MDL-DEPR005**; `mxcli fmt --upgrade` removes it.

`ALTER PAGE` addresses a column by **what describe prints in it** — its
`attribute:` value, or its `caption:`:

```mdl
mdl 1;
alter page Mod.P { set (Caption: 'Renamed') on dg1 column(Label) };       -- the column bound to Label
alter page Mod.P { drop dg1 column('Actions') };                           -- the column captioned Actions
alter page Mod.P { set (Sortable: false) on dg1 column(Owner/Name) };      -- over an association, as describe writes it
```

Two columns over the same attribute (or with the same caption) share the
address. ALTER refuses it rather than picking one, and the error lists the
matches — add `@n` to choose: `drop dg1 column(FullName)@2`.

The older `dg1.Label` form still works: it addresses a column by a name mxcli
derives (the attribute's short name, else the sanitized caption, else `colN` by
position). Prefer `column(…)`, which says what it matches.

### Setting column properties

Property names resolve against the keys the installed widget declares, so both
the schema key and mxcli's MDL alias work (`DynamicCellClass` and `ColumnClass`
both reach `columnClass`). An unknown name lists what *is* settable on that grid.

**`DynamicCellClass` (and a widget's `DynamicClasses`) take a Mendix expression,
written as-is.** A quoted value is a Mendix string, so a literal CSS class is just
the quoted class name, and a computed one is the expression itself:

```mdl
mdl 1;
-- a literal class: the string 'highlight'
alter page Mod.P { SET (DynamicCellClass: 'highlight') ON dg1 column(Label) };

-- a computed class
alter page Mod.P { SET (DynamicCellClass: if $currentObject/Price > 100 then 'highlight' else '') ON dg1 column(Label) };
```

```text
-- WRONG: a bare name is an identifier, not a string — mxbuild reports CE0117
alter page Mod.P { SET (DynamicCellClass: highlight) ON dg1 column(Label) };
```

The old spelling — the expression's text in quotes, `'if … then ''a'' else '''''`
— is refused under `mdl 1;` as MDL-WIDGET33, because there it stores that text
as a class name. A script without the header keeps its old meaning and warns
MDL-V1-QUOTEDEXPR; `mxcli fmt --upgrade` writes it bare. This applies equally to
`create page`; the two paths behave identically.

A column's pluggable `Visible` expression is not converted yet: there a quoted
value is still the expression's text, so a literal needs the doubled quotes.

Properties holding a **structured** value — `attribute`, `filter`, `content`,
actions — cannot be set by ALTER at all. It refuses them and points at
`create or modify page`, rather than writing a string where Mendix expects a
reference.

**Widget property names are matched case-insensitively**, pluggable ones
included, so a spelling `CREATE PAGE` accepts is a spelling `ALTER PAGE` accepts
— `set (PageSize: 10) on dgProducts` and `set (pageSize: 10) on dgProducts` are the
same statement. This is what makes DESCRIBE output re-executable: `describe page`
prints the capitalised `PageSize:`, while the widget template stores `pageSize`
(mendixlabs/mxcli#1069). A property the widget does not declare is still an
error — and `mxcli check … --references` reports it **before** the script runs,
so a typo no longer lands halfway through. The pre-flight resolves the name
against the stored document rather than a list, so it is right about whatever
widget package this project has installed; the error names the widget's own
property keys. `ON` a widget the page does not have is caught the same way.

Two things it deliberately stays quiet about, because it cannot answer them: a
page the script itself creates (nothing is stored yet — the widgets there are
checked where they are written), and a widget an `INSERT` in the same script
adds. Both still fail at exec if they are genuinely wrong.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Missing `on widgetName` for widget SET | Add `on widgetName` (only page-level properties — `Title`, `Documentation`, `PopupWidth`, `PopupHeight`, `PopupResizable`, `Class`, `Style` — omit ON) |
| `unsupported page-level property: title` | Page-level property names are case-sensitive — use `Title`, `PopupWidth`, `PopupHeight`, `PopupResizable`, `Class`, `Style` |
| Using unquoted pluggable property names | Quote pluggable props: `set ('showLabel': false) on cb` |
| `pluggable property "X" not found` | The widget does not declare it — casing is not the problem (any casing resolves). The error lists the keys it does declare; `describe widget type <type>` or `describe page` shows them in context. Run `mxcli check … --references` to get this before the script runs |
| Wrong widget name | Use `describe page Module.Name` to see widget names |
| SET on non-existent widget | Widget names are case-sensitive; check with DESCRIBE |
| Missing semicolons between operations | Each operation inside `{ }` ends with `;` |

## Limitations — prefer binding at page creation (ledger finding #45)

`ALTER PAGE` is best for *content* edits (add/remove/retitle widgets). When you hit
the limit below, define the referenced microflows **before** the
page and bind the buttons at creation time instead of rewiring afterwards:

1. **`SET` cannot rewire a button's action.** `set` accepts a fixed property list
   (`caption`, `class`, `visible`, …) — `action` is not on it, so
   `set Action = call microflow … on btnSave` is a parse error. Set the button's action
   when the button is created (or `REPLACE` the button subtree).

**A data view's footer has no name.** Its widgets are stored in the data
   view, and the footer itself is not, so a name written on it is never kept
   (MDL-DEPR005) and `describe` prints `footer { … }`. Address it by its data
   view: `replace dvMain.footer with { footer { … } }`, `insert into
   dvMain.footer { … }`, `drop dvMain.footer`.

**Recommended pattern**: put save/reset microflows in a file that runs *before* the
page definition, and bind the popup/footer buttons to them at creation. The
apparent "page needs microflow, microflow needs page" cycle usually exists only
between *different* microflows, not within the page itself.

## Validation Checklist

1. **Get widget names first**: Run `describe page Module.PageName` to see all widget names
2. **Check syntax**: `mxcli check script.mdl`
3. **Check references**: `mxcli check script.mdl -p app.mpr --references`
4. **Verify result**: Run `describe page Module.PageName` after ALTER to confirm changes
5. **Validate project**: `mxcli docker check -p app.mpr` (or `mxcli docker check -p app.mpr`)
