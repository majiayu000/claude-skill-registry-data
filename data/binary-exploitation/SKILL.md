# Binary Exploitation Skill

## Overview

This skill provides advanced binary exploitation capabilities including mitigation bypass techniques.

## Capabilities

- Identify exploitation primitives
- Analyze memory corruption types
- Calculate offsets and gadgets
- Bypass ASLR/PIE/NX/Canaries
- Generate heap exploitation chains
- Support kernel exploitation
- Create type confusion exploits
- Handle JIT compilation exploits

## Target Processes

- exploit-development.js
- shellcode-development.js
- binary-reverse-engineering.js
- capture-the-flag-challenges.js

## Dependencies

- GDB with pwndbg or gef
- ROPgadget
- one_gadget
- pwntools
- checksec
- Python 3.x

## Usage Context

This skill is essential for:
- Advanced exploit development
- Mitigation bypass research
- Kernel exploitation
- Browser/JIT exploitation
- Heap exploitation

## Integration Notes

- Supports multiple architectures
- Can automate common exploitation patterns
- Integrates with debugging tools
- Supports both userland and kernel
- Can generate reliable exploits
