# Welcome Email Sequence for Therapy Practice

Convert contact form submissions into booked appointments through trust-building, not pressure tactics.

---

## The Problem This Solves

**Current Flow (Broken):**
1. Person fills out contact form
2. You email back: "When can you meet?"
3. They ghost or take weeks to respond
4. No relationship built during decision phase

**Why They Ghost:**
- Anxiety about starting therapy
- Not sure if virtual therapy works
- Don't know what to expect
- Worried about cost/insurance
- Comparing other therapists

**Welcome Sequence Flow (Fixed):**
1. Person fills out contact form
2. **Immediate automated welcome email** (you'll respond within 24h)
3. **Over next 7-10 days:** Educational emails that build trust
4. By the time you follow up, they feel like they know you
5. **Higher show-up rate** for first session

---

## The 5-Email Welcome Sequence

### Email 1: Immediate Confirmation (Sent Immediately)

**Purpose:** Reduce anxiety, set expectations

**Subject:** "Got your message - I'll respond within 24 hours"

**Body Structure:**
```
[Warm acknowledgment]
Thanks for reaching out to NextStep Therapy. I know taking this step isn't easy.

[Set expectations]
I'll personally respond to you within the next 24 hours to discuss how I can support you.

[Reduce anxiety about therapy]
In the meantime, I wanted to share a few things about how therapy works here:
- All sessions are confidential
- We'll move at your pace
- Virtual sessions are just as effective as in-person
- Insurance receipts provided

[No pressure]
Take your time. There's no rush to respond right away.

Jesse Cynamon, RP (CRPO #10979)
NextStep Therapy
```

**CRPO Compliance:** ✅ Informational, no pressure, factual

---

### Email 2: What to Expect (Day 2)

**Purpose:** Demystify therapy process

**Subject:** "What happens in a first session?"

**Body Structure:**
```
[Empathetic opener]
Starting therapy can feel a bit mysterious. What actually happens in that first session?

[Structure breakdown]
Here's how the first session usually goes:

**Getting to Know You (20-25 min)**
- What brought you here?
- What's been going on lately?
- What are you hoping therapy might help with?

**My Role (5-10 min)**
- I'll share how I work (person-centered, ACT-informed)
- We'll discuss confidentiality and logistics
- You can ask any questions

**Next Steps (5-10 min)**
- If it feels like a good fit, we'll schedule ongoing sessions
- If not, I can suggest other resources
- No pressure either way

[Reassurance]
The first session is as much for you to get a sense of me as it is for me to understand how I can help.

[Soft CTA]
If you have questions before we meet, just reply to this email.

Jesse
```

**CRPO Compliance:** ✅ Educational, process-focused, no outcomes promised

---

### Email 3: Your Story (Day 4)

**Purpose:** Build connection and trust

**Subject:** "Why I became a therapist"

**Body Structure:**
```
[Personal opener]
I thought it might be helpful if you knew a bit about me and why I do this work.

[Your story - authentic, vulnerable]
I became a therapist because [authentic reason - can reference Jesse's actual story]:
- Struggled with anxiety in my 20s
- Found therapy helpful but also frustrating at times
- Wanted to practice therapy differently than what I experienced
- Person-centered, not prescriptive

[What you learned]
What I learned from my own experience:
- Feeling understood matters more than getting advice
- Therapy works best when it's a collaboration
- You're the expert in your own life

[Connection back to them]
If you've been dealing with anxiety, burnout, or feeling stuck—I get it because I've been there too.

[No CTA - just connection]
More soon.

Jesse
```

**CRPO Compliance:** ✅ Personal disclosure appropriate for building rapport, no outcome claims

---

### Email 4: Common Questions (Day 6)

**Purpose:** Remove logistical barriers

**Subject:** "Your therapy questions, answered"

**Body Structure:**
```
[Frame it]
Here are the questions I hear most often from new clients:

**"Does virtual therapy actually work?"**
Yes. Research shows virtual therapy is just as effective as in-person for anxiety, depression, and most concerns. You get the same connection, just from home.

**"How much does it cost?"**
$[rate] per session. I provide insurance receipts that you can submit to your provider. Most Ontario insurance plans cover psychotherapy.

**"How often do we meet?"**
Usually weekly, at least at the start. As things stabilize, we might shift to bi-weekly. It's flexible based on what you need.

**"What if I don't feel like it's a good fit?"**
That's completely okay. Fit matters more than credentials. If it doesn't feel right after a session or two, I can suggest other therapists.

**"How long does therapy take?"**
It varies. Some people work with me for a few months, others for a year+. We'll check in regularly about whether it's still helpful.

[Soft CTA]
Have other questions? Just reply—I'm happy to answer.

Jesse
```

**CRPO Compliance:** ✅ All factual, addresses objections, no pressure

---

### Email 5: Gentle Reminder (Day 8)

**Purpose:** Prompt action without pressure

**Subject:** "Ready when you are"

**Body Structure:**
```
[Acknowledge time passed]
It's been about a week since you first reached out. I wanted to check in.

[No pressure frame]
Starting therapy is a big step, and it's okay if you're still deciding. There's no rush.

[Simple CTA]
If you'd like to book a first session, you can:
- Reply to this email with your availability
- [Link to booking calendar if you have one]

Same-week appointments are usually available.

[Alternative action for hesitant]
If you're still on the fence, feel free to reply with any questions. Happy to chat before you commit to a session.

Take care,
Jesse
```

**CRPO Compliance:** ✅ No urgency, patient, respects autonomy

---

## Optional Email 6-7 (If They Still Haven't Booked)

### Email 6: Resource Gift (Day 12)

**Purpose:** Provide value even if they don't book

**Subject:** "A resource for managing anxiety (free)"

**Body Structure:**
```
[Acknowledge inaction, no judgment]
I haven't heard back from you yet, and that's completely okay. Sometimes the timing just isn't right.

[Value without expectation]
In the meantime, I wanted to share something that might be helpful:

[Educational resource - NOT a lead magnet that requires opt-in]
- Link to a blog post about managing anxiety
- Link to a simple grounding technique
- Link to understanding ACT principles

[No strings attached]
No sign-up required. Just wanted to share something useful.

[Final soft CTA]
If you ever want to connect, my door is open.

Jesse
```

**CRPO Compliance:** ✅ Genuinely helpful, no manipulation

---

### Email 7: Final Check-In (Day 15)

**Purpose:** Close the loop gracefully

**Subject:** "One last note"

**Body Structure:**
```
[Graceful close]
This will be my last email unless I hear from you.

[Normalize not booking]
It's completely normal to reach out and then decide the timing isn't right. No judgment at all.

[Door stays open]
If you ever want to book a session in the future—whether that's next month or next year—just email me. I'll still be here.

[Genuine well-wish]
I hope you find the support you're looking for, whether that's with me or someone else.

Take care of yourself,
Jesse Cynamon, RP
NextStep Therapy
```

**CRPO Compliance:** ✅ Respectful closure, no guilt trip

---

---

## Technical Setup

### Automation Tools

**Option 1: ConvertKit (Kit)**
- Create form on website
- Set up automated sequence
- Tag subscribers by source (students/professionals/general)

**Option 2: Mailchimp**
- Similar setup
- Free tier might suffice initially

**Option 3: Manual (Start Here)**
- Template each email in Gmail drafts
- When someone fills form, manually send Email 1
- Set calendar reminders for Days 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.
- Copy/paste and personalize

**Recommended:** Start manual, automate once you have 10+ leads/month

---

## Copy Guidelines

### Tone for Therapy Emails

**DO:**
- Write like you're emailing a friend who's going through something
- Use "I" and "you" freely
- Be warm but professional
- Acknowledge difficulty of reaching out
- Normalize hesitation

**DON'T:**
- Sound corporate or clinical
- Use jargon without explanation
- Be overly casual (avoid "Hey buddy!")
- Create false urgency
- Guilt trip for not responding

### Subject Line Rules

**Good (specific, calm):**
- "What happens in a first session?"
- "Your therapy questions, answered"
- "Why I became a therapist"

**Bad (vague, pushy):**
- "Don't miss this!"
- "Still interested?"
- "Last chance to book"

---

## Measuring Success

### Track These Metrics

**Baseline (before sequence):**
- Contact form submissions: X/month
- Booking rate: Y% (people who book / people who inquire)
- No-show rate: Z%

**After implementing sequence:**
- Booking rate should increase 10-25%
- No-show rate should decrease 5-15%
- Open rates: 40-60% is healthy for therapy
- Reply rate: 10-20% replying with questions is good

**What to test:**
- Email 3 variations (different stories)
- Subject lines
- Day spacing (maybe Day 1, 3, 5, 7 instead of 2, 4, 6, 8)

---

## Common Questions

### "Won't this feel impersonal?"

**No, because:**
- You still personally reply to initial inquiry
- The sequence fills the silence while they decide
- Each email builds your voice and approach
- More personal than silence

### "What if they book before Email 5?"

**Perfect!**
- Remove them from sequence immediately
- Send different "looking forward to meeting" email

### "Should I include pricing in Email 1?"

**Depends:**
- If price is a common objection: Yes, mention in Email 1
- If you want to build connection first: Wait until Email 4
- Test both and see what converts better

### "Can I use this for existing clients?"

**No.**
- This is specifically for NEW leads who haven't booked
- Don't add existing clients to this sequence
