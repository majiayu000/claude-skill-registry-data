# Canvas Design

## Purpose

Creates beautiful, original visual art and designs in .png and .pdf formats. Specializes in applying design principles, color theory, typography, and composition to produce professional-quality static visual pieces. Always creates original work, never copies existing artists.

## When to Use

- User requests a poster, flyer, or visual design
- Need to create art, illustrations, or graphics
- Want to design a logo, icon, or branding element
- Creating infographics or data visualizations
- Designing presentation slides or marketing materials
- Need custom graphics for web or print
- User asks for "design", "art", "poster", "visual", "graphic"

## Core Capabilities

### Design Principles

- **Balance**: Visual weight distribution (symmetrical, asymmetrical, radial)
- **Contrast**: Creating visual interest through differences
- **Hierarchy**: Guiding viewer attention through importance
- **Alignment**: Creating visual connections and organization
- **Repetition**: Building consistency and cohesion
- **Proximity**: Grouping related elements
- **White Space**: Strategic use of empty areas

### Color Theory

- **Color Harmonies**
  - Monochromatic: Single hue with variations
  - Analogous: Adjacent colors on color wheel
  - Complementary: Opposite colors for contrast
  - Triadic: Three colors equidistant on wheel
  - Split-complementary: Base + two adjacent to complement

- **Color Psychology**
  - Red: Energy, passion, urgency
  - Blue: Trust, calm, professionalism
  - Green: Nature, growth, health
  - Yellow: Optimism, clarity, warmth
  - Purple: Luxury, creativity, wisdom
  - Orange: Enthusiasm, friendliness, confidence
  - Black: Sophistication, power, elegance
  - White: Purity, simplicity, cleanliness

- **Color Application**
  - 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
  - Establish visual hierarchy with color
  - Consider accessibility (contrast ratios)
  - Account for cultural color meanings

### Typography

- **Font Categories**
  - Serif: Traditional, authoritative, readable
  - Sans-serif: Modern, clean, minimalist
  - Display: Decorative, attention-grabbing
  - Script: Elegant, personal, formal
  - Monospace: Technical, code, retro

- **Type Hierarchy**
  - Establish clear levels (H1, H2, body, captions)
  - Use size, weight, and color for differentiation
  - Limit to 2-3 fonts maximum
  - Ensure readability at all sizes

- **Spacing & Alignment**
  - Line height: 1.4-1.6 for body text
  - Letter-spacing: Adjust for readability
  - Text alignment: Left, center, right, justified
  - Whitespace around text blocks

### Composition Techniques

- **Rule of Thirds**: Divide canvas into 9 parts, place focal points at intersections
- **Golden Ratio**: 1:1.618 proportion for aesthetically pleasing layouts
- **Focal Points**: Direct viewer attention to key elements
- **Visual Flow**: Guide eye movement through design
- **Framing**: Use elements to frame important content
- **Layering**: Create depth with foreground/background
- **Symmetry vs Asymmetry**: Choose based on message

## Design Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Requirements

**Questions to Ask**:
- What is the purpose/message?
- Who is the target audience?
- What format? (poster, logo, infographic, etc.)
- What dimensions/aspect ratio?
- Any color preferences or brand guidelines?
- What mood/feeling should it convey?

**Deliverable**: Clear design brief

### Step 2: Concept Development

**Process**:
1. Define the core message (one sentence)
2. Choose appropriate style (minimal, bold, elegant, playful, etc.)
3. Select color palette (2-5 colors)
4. Pick typography (1-3 fonts)
5. Sketch rough layout concept

**Deliverable**: Design direction with rationale

### Step 3: Layout Design

**Elements to Define**:
- Canvas size and orientation
- Grid system or layout structure
- Placement of text elements
- Placement of visual elements
- Hierarchy of information
- White space allocation

**Deliverable**: Structured layout plan

### Step 4: Visual Execution

**Implementation**:
1. Apply color palette
2. Set typography with hierarchy
3. Add visual elements (shapes, icons, illustrations)
4. Apply effects (shadows, gradients, textures)
5. Ensure balance and alignment
6. Test contrast and readability

**Deliverable**: Complete design in requested format

### Step 5: Refinement

**Review**:
- Check alignment and spacing
- Verify readability at different sizes
- Test color contrast (accessibility)
- Ensure visual hierarchy is clear
- Remove unnecessary elements
- Polish details

**Deliverable**: Final polished design

- **Guide the eye**: Use visual flow to lead viewer

### Color

- **Consider context**: Colors look different on screen vs print
- **Use color purposefully**: Every color should have a reason
- **Create a palette first**: Don't pick colors on the fly

### Typography
- **Hierarchy first**: Establish clear levels of importance
- **Limit fonts**: 2-3 maximum, often 1-2 is enough
- **Mind the spacing**: Proper kerning, leading, tracking
- **Readability**: Ensure text is legible at intended size
- **Pair wisely**: Combine fonts with different personalities

### Workflow
- **Start simple**: Add complexity gradually
- **Design in black and white first**: Focus on structure
- **Get feedback**: Show work-in-progress
- **Sleep on it**: Fresh eyes catch issues
- **Export multiple versions**: Different sizes/formats

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't Copy Existing Art**
- **Why**: Copyright infringement
- **Instead**: Create original work inspired by concepts, not specific pieces

❌ **Don't Use Too Many Fonts**
- **Why**: Creates visual chaos
- **Instead**: Limit to 2-3 fonts with clear hierarchy

❌ **Don't Ignore White Space**
- **Why**: Design feels cramped and unprofessional
- **Instead**: Give elements room to breathe

❌ **Don't Use All Caps for Long Text**
- **Why**: Difficult to read, feels like shouting
- **Instead**: Use for short headlines or emphasis only

❌ **Don't Center Everything**
- **Why**: Can feel static and amateur
- **Instead**: Mix alignments strategically

❌ **Don't Use Low Contrast**
- **Why**: Hard to read, not accessible
- **Instead**: Test contrast ratios, aim for 4.5:1 minimum

❌ **Don't Stretch/Distort Images or Fonts**
- **Why**: Looks unprofessional
- **Instead**: Maintain aspect ratios, scale proportionally

❌ **Don't Overuse Effects**
- **Why**: Looks dated and cluttered
- **Instead**: Use effects sparingly and purposefully
