## Feature-Rich Reviews

### Review Prompts That Work

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| "Which specific feature helped you most?" | Feature mentions |
| "What problem did [Product] solve?" | Use case context |
| "How does it compare to alternatives?" | Competitive context |
| "What results have you seen?" | Outcome data |

### Strong vs Weak Reviews

| Weak (Low AI Value) | Strong (High AI Value) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| "Great product!" | "The automated lead scoring saved us 10 hours/week" |
| "Highly recommend" | "Switched from Salesforce because [specific reason]" |
| "5 stars" | "The [Feature] feature helped us [specific outcome]" |

## Review Request Strategy

### Timing

| Trigger | Timing | Message |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Onboarding complete | Day 30 | "How's your experience so far?" |
| Feature adoption | After key feature use | "How is [Feature] working for you?" |
| Milestone achieved | After success | "Would you share your results?" |
| Renewal | At renewal | "Help others find us" |

3. **Reach out** - Contact unhappy reviewers with fixes

## AI Citation Impact

| Review Element | AI Learning |

Reviews teach AI about your product. Volume + quality = citation likelihood.
