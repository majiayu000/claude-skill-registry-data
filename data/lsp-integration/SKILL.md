# LSP Integration Skill

You are an expert in leveraging Language Server Protocol (LSP) for semantic code understanding. LSP provides 100x faster and more accurate code exploration than text-based grep searches.

## Overview

LSP servers understand code semantically - they know about types, symbols, references, and relationships between code elements. This enables precise navigation and refactoring that text search cannot achieve.

## Supported Languages

| Language | LSP Server | Install |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| TypeScript/JavaScript | `typescript-language-server` | `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript` |
| Python | `python-lsp-server` (pylsp) | `pip install python-lsp-server` |
| Go | `gopls` | `go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest` |
| Rust | `rust-analyzer` | Via rustup or standalone |
| Java | `jdtls` | Eclipse JDT Language Server |
| C# | `omnisharp` | .NET SDK |

## Key Operations

### 1. Go to Definition
Navigate to where a symbol is defined.

```bash
# Using TypeScript language server
npx ts-node --eval "
const ts = require('typescript');
// Find definition of symbol at position
"
```

**Use case**: "Where is this function defined?" → Find exact location in codebase.

### 2. Find All References
Find every place a symbol is used.

**Critical for refactoring**: Before renaming or changing a function, ALWAYS find all references to understand impact.

```bash
# Find all usages of a function/variable/class
# LSP tracks semantic references, not just text matches
```

**Use case**: "What will break if I change this interface?" → Find all implementations and usages.

### 3. Document Symbols
Get structured view of all symbols in a file.

**Use case**: "What functions/classes are in this file?" → Get hierarchy without parsing.

### 4. Hover Information
Get type information and documentation for any symbol.

**Use case**: "What type does this variable have?" → Get inferred or declared type.

### 5. Diagnostics
Get compilation errors and warnings.

**Use case**: "Are there any type errors?" → Real-time error checking.

## When to Use LSP vs Grep

| Task | Use LSP | Use Grep |
|------|---------|----------|
| Find function definition | ✅ Precise | ⚠️ May find wrong match |
| Find all references | ✅ Semantic | ⚠️ Misses renamed imports |
| Search for text pattern | ❌ Not designed for this | ✅ Fast text search |
| Understand type hierarchy | ✅ Full inheritance chain | ❌ Cannot determine |
| Check for type errors | ✅ Compiler-accurate | ❌ Impossible |
| Find files by name | ❌ Overkill | ✅ Use Glob |

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use findReferences Before Refactoring
```
❌ WRONG: Grep for function name → rename → hope nothing breaks
✅ RIGHT: LSP findReferences → understand all usages → safe rename
```

### 2. Use goToDefinition Instead of Grep
```
❌ WRONG: grep -r "function processOrder" .
✅ RIGHT: LSP goToDefinition → exact location, handles imports/exports
```

### 3. Combine with Explore Agent
For complex exploration tasks, combine LSP operations with the Explore agent:
```
1. LSP: Find all references to deprecated function
2. Explore: Understand migration patterns in codebase
3. LSP: Navigate to each usage for refactoring
```

## TypeScript/JavaScript Specific

### Setup
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript

# Verify installation
typescript-language-server --version
```

### Common Operations

**Find where interface is implemented:**
```typescript
// LSP findReferences on interface → shows all implementing classes
```

**Check type at position:**
```typescript
// LSP hover → shows inferred type, even for complex generics
```

**Find unused exports:**
```typescript
// LSP diagnostics + findReferences → exports with 0 references
```

## Python Specific

### Setup
```bash
pip install python-lsp-server
# Optional: Add type checking
pip install pylsp-mypy
```

### Common Operations

**Find class hierarchy:**
```python
# LSP can show base classes and subclasses
```

**Check import resolution:**
```python
# LSP resolves imports even with complex __init__.py structures
```

## Integration with SpecWeave

### In CLAUDE.md (already documented)
LSP operations are recommended in the SpecWeave workflow:
- Use `findReferences` before any refactoring
- Use `goToDefinition` for code navigation
- Use `getDiagnostics` to check for errors

### Workflow Example

1. **Before implementing**: Use LSP to understand existing code structure
2. **During implementation**: Use diagnostics to catch errors early
3. **Before commit**: Use findReferences to verify no broken usages
4. **Code review**: Use LSP to trace data flow through system

## Troubleshooting

### LSP Server Not Starting
```bash
# Check if server is installed
which typescript-language-server
which pylsp
which gopls

# Check for initialization errors
typescript-language-server --stdio 2>&1 | head -20
```

### Slow Performance
- Exclude `node_modules` and build directories
- Ensure `tsconfig.json` or equivalent is properly configured
- Increase memory limits for large projects

### Missing References
- Ensure project is properly typed
- Check that all dependencies have type definitions
- Verify language server has indexed the project

## Token Budget

- **LSP setup instructions**: 200-300 tokens
- **Single operation explanation**: 100-200 tokens
- **Full workflow**: 400-600 tokens

**NEVER exceed 2000 tokens per response!**
