# Webinar Engagement Analytics Skill

## When to Use
- Building dashboards for registrations → attendance → engagement → conversion.
- Investigating drop-offs or anomalous sessions.
- Reporting to GTM leadership on webinar ROI.

## Framework
1. **Metrics Stack** – acquisition, attendance, engagement, conversion, satisfaction ladders.
2. **KPI Design** – define thresholds per tier and align with GTM goals.
3. **Data Plumbing** – map sources (platform, MAP, CRM, survey) and refresh schedules.
4. **Analytics Workflow** – build dashboards/anomaly alerts and run cohort analyses.
5. **Insight Loop** – document findings, actions, and owners in recurring reports.

## Templates
- KPI tracker spreadsheet (target vs actual vs delta).
- Insight brief structure (observation, impact, recommendation, owner).
- Experiment log tied to engagement metrics.

## Tips
- Track on-demand performance separately; long-tail views often exceed live.
- Segment by acquisition channel to optimize promotion mix.
- Combine qualitative feedback with quantitative metrics for context.
