# Compliance Briefing Kit Skill

## When to Use
- Kicking off HIPAA/FDA-compliant campaign reviews.
- Preparing legal/medical reviewers with complete context.
- Auditing historical campaigns for documentation completeness.

## Framework
1. **Campaign Snapshot** – objectives, audiences, channels, timelines, owners.
2. **Data & Consent Map** – data sources, identifiers, consent method, retention policy.
3. **Claims & Evidence** – value propositions, clinical proof, disclaimers, risk statements.
4. **Regulatory Checklist** – HIPAA, FDA (DTC/HCP), FTC, regional privacy, accessibility steps.
5. **Approval Workflow** – reviewers, SLAs, escalation path, expiration date.

## Templates
- Compliance intake form (fillable PDF/Notion) with required fields.
- Reviewer packet structure (assets, claims, data flows, prior approvals).
- Decision log sheet with timestamps and attachments.

## Tips
- Require complete claims/evidence attachments before routing to legal.
- Include version history to track copy or asset changes during review.
- Pair with `run-compliance-review` for automated routing + documentation.
