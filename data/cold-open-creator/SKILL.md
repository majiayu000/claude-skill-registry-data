# Podcast Cold Open Creator

## Purpose

Create 25-35 second cold opens that drop listeners into a **story arc** - someone who wanted something, encountered obstacles, and figured something out. The cold open cuts at the tension peak, before the resolution.

**Core Philosophy:** The cold open is not a summary or a trailer. It's a story interrupted at the moment of maximum tension. They should finish the cold open asking "How did we get here?" and "What happens next?"

---

## The Narrative Snippets Method (Primary Approach)

The best cold opens follow recognizable story beats. Instead of searching for "good moments," search for **complete story arcs**, then cut them at the right point.

### The Story Beats

Every compelling story follows this pattern:

| Beat | What Happens | Cold Open Role |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **1. Setup** | Protagonist in their world, pursuing something | INCLUDE - establishes context |
| **2. Disaster** | Something disrupts the status quo | INCLUDE - creates tension |
| **3. Failed Approach** | They try the obvious solution, it backfires | INCLUDE - shows stakes |
| **4. New Insight** | A realization that changes everything | TEASE or CUT HERE |
| **5. Resolution** | They apply the insight, it works | CUT BEFORE THIS |
| **6. Reflection** | The universal takeaway | CUT BEFORE THIS |

**The Rule:** Include beats 1-3 (maybe hint at 4). Cut BEFORE beats 5-6. The cold open ends with the question unresolved.

### Finding Story Arcs in Transcripts

Scan for these signal phrases:

**Disaster signals:**
- "Then everything fell apart..."
- "I was diagnosed with..."
- "The call came and they said no..."
- "I realized I was doing it wrong..."

**Failed approach signals:**
- "I tried X but it didn't work..."
- "We did everything we were supposed to..."
- "Most people just accept it and move on..."

**Insight signals (CUT HERE OR JUST BEFORE):**
- "Then I realized..."
- "That's when it clicked..."
- "So what we do instead is..." [CUT]
- "The real reason was..." [CUT]

### Example: The Schultz Story

**Full arc (as it might appear in transcript):**

1. **Setup:** Schultz flew to SF for a dinner meeting, hoping to get a job at Starbucks. He'd spent a year flying back and forth.
2. **Optimism:** "The dinner went exceptionally well. I was convinced I had the job sown up."
3. **Disaster:** "I'm sorry Howard, I have bad news... It's too risky, too much change."
4. **Failed approach (what most do):** "Most people, when turned down for a job, just go away."
5. **Different response:** "But this was a turning point in my life. It had to happen."
6. **Makes case:** "Jerry, you're making a terrible mistake... This isn't about me, it's about you."
7. **Resolution:** "I'm sorry about the twenty-four hour impasse. We're going forward."
8. **Success:** Five years later, bought the company, grew to 40,000 stores.
9. **Reflection:** "Life is a series of near misses. But a lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all."

**For cold open:** Include beats 1-4. Hint at beat 5. CUT before beat 7.

**Cold open version:**
> "The dinner went exceptionally well. I was convinced I had the job sown up."
>
> [beat]
>
> "I'm sorry Howard, I have bad news... It's too risky, too much change."
>
> [beat]
>
> "Most people, when turned down for a job, just go away."
>
> [beat]
>
> "But this was a turning point in my life. It had to happen. So I called him back the next day and said—"
>
> [CUT]

The listener NEEDS to know what Schultz said. That's the hook.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create cold opens for podcast episodes
- Hook listeners in the first 25-35 seconds
- Find story arcs or scenes that best represent the episode
- Rearrange existing transcript clips to maximize tension and curiosity
- Create a sense of "you're already late to this conversation"

---

## Two Approaches

### Approach A: Narrative Snippets (Preferred)
Use when the episode contains **personal stories with clear arcs** - someone who wanted something, faced obstacles, figured something out. Works best for:
- Origin stories
- Failure-to-success journeys
- Realization/discovery moments
- Before/after transformations

### Approach B: Scene Selection (Fallback)
Use when the episode is more **philosophical/conversational** without clear narrative arcs. Works best for:
- Expert interviews about concepts
- Debates or discussions
- Episodes heavy on advice/tips rather than stories

**Decision rule:** Scan the transcript for story arcs first. If you find one with beats 1-4 clearly present, use Approach A. If the content is more abstract/conceptual, use Approach B.

---

## The Fundamental Constraint

**You have ONLY TWO tools:**
1. **CUTTING** — Delete portions of what was said (or what wasn't said)
2. **REARRANGING** — Change the order clips appear (non-chronological)

**You CANNOT:**
- Add words that weren't spoken
- Paraphrase or reword
- Create new dialogue
- Add voiceover or narration
- Change the meaning of what was said

**The Art:** Like a documentary editor selecting and sequencing pre-shot footage to tell a different story than the chronological one that actually happened.

## The Descript Elements: What Makes a Cold Open Work

### 1. The Scene
Find the exact right moment—something small that encapsulates the big themes. Something specific that also gestures toward the general.

**Questions to ask:**
- What moment in this episode keeps bringing me back?
- What's an anecdote or revelation that made me lean in?
- Is there a conflict, realization, or shift happening?
- What's an inflection point where something changed?

### 2. The Character
Get them on the page in ACTION, not passively described.

**In a podcast context, this means:**
- Start with the guest (or host) doing or revealing something specific
- Don't introduce them abstractly ("Dr. Amy Moore is a psychologist...")
- Show them in the middle of something that matters

### 3. The Stakes
Make us understand what's at stake for the character or listener.

**Examples of stakes:**
- "Her next paycheck depends on it"
- "These kids don't have the tools to succeed"
- "If we don't understand this, we'll keep making the same mistake"
- "This changed everything about how I parent"

### 4. The Conflict/Shift
Find moments of friction, surprise, or expectation-violation.

**Look for:**
- Contradiction hooks (what we think vs. what's true)
- Surprising revelations (we expected one thing, got another)
- Moments of struggle or realization
- Points where the character's perspective changed

### 5. The Setup/Tease
End by gesturing toward what's to come without giving it away.

**The tease should:**
- Leave a question unanswered
- Hint at a bigger pattern or insight
- Make the listener curious about how we got here
- Promise there's more to understand

## The Workflow: 4 Steps

### Step 1: Find Story Arcs (Narrative Snippets Approach)

**First pass:** Scan the transcript for complete story arcs - someone who wanted something, encountered obstacles, figured something out.

**Signal phrases for story arcs:**

| Beat | Signal Phrases |
|------|----------------|
| **Setup** | "Back then I was..." / "I had been trying to..." / "For years I thought..." |
| **Disaster** | "Then everything fell apart..." / "I was diagnosed with..." / "The call came and they said no..." |
| **Failed Approach** | "I tried X but..." / "We did everything we were supposed to..." / "Most people just accept it..." |
| **Insight** | "Then I realized..." / "That's when it clicked..." / "So what we do instead is..." |

**If you find a story arc with beats 1-4:** Use the Narrative Snippets approach. Extract the arc, identify where to cut (after beat 3 or partway through beat 4).

**If no clear story arcs:** Fall back to Scene Selection approach below.

---

### Step 1B: Scene Selection (Fallback)

For episodes without clear narrative arcs, scan for standalone moments:

**Inflection Points** (moments of shift):
- "I was diagnosed with ADHD..."
- "Then everything changed..."
- "I realized I was doing it wrong..."

**Vulnerability Moments** (personal stakes):
- "I failed college twice..."
- "My kid couldn't spell his own name..."
- "I was terrified..."

**Contradiction Moments** (what we think vs. reality):
- "We thought he was defiant, but actually..."
- "Most people believe X, but the research shows..."
- "It looks like they're ignoring you, but really..."

**Surprising Insights** (research or data):
- "5,000 studies showed that..."
- "The weakest skill wasn't attention, it was..."
- "What nobody talks about is..."

Choose ONE scene that:
- Contains a character (ideally the guest)
- Shows them doing or revealing something
- Has stakes attached
- Hints at a bigger theme
- Creates a natural question or gap

### Step 2: Extract Clips from That Scene
Now that you know your scene, find all the verbatim clips within and around it.

**Pull clips that show:**
1. **The setup** — Where is this character? What are they in the middle of?
2. **The character** — Who are they? What are they struggling with or realizing?
3. **The conflict** — What's the tension or contradiction?
4. **The shift** — What changed or what's surprising?
5. **The tease** — What question does this leave unanswered?

**Document each clip with:**
- Speaker name
- Exact timestamp
- Verbatim quote
- Approximate duration (~3-8 seconds each)

### Step 3: Arrange for Narrative Arc (Not Chronological Order)
Now rearrange these clips to tell a more dramatic story than the original sequence.

**The Descript Arc Structure:**
1. **Scene/Setup** (2-3 sec) — Drop us into the moment
2. **Character** (3-5 sec) — Who is this person? Show them in action
3. **Conflict/Shift** (4-6 sec) — What's the tension or surprise?
4. **Stakes** (2-3 sec) — Why does this matter?
5. **Tease** (2-3 sec) — What question are we left with? [CUT mid-thought or mid-revelation]

**Key principle:** You are NOT arranging chronologically. You are arranging for maximum emotional/intellectual impact.

**Example false chronology:**
- Original order in episode: Background → Struggle → Revelation → Action
- Cold open order: Revelation → Struggle → Background → Action (cuts before answer)

### Step 4: Quality Control Against the 5 Tests

**The Stranger Test**
- Would someone with zero context be intrigued?
- Does it create questions rather than provide answers?

**The Itch Test**
- Does it create an unbearable need to know more?
- Would you feel frustrated if the episode ended here?

**The Stakes Test**
- Is it clear why this matters?
- Does the listener care about the character or outcome?

**The Tease Test**
- Does it hint at something without giving it away?
- Are we left wondering "how?" or "what next?"

**The Emotion Test**
- Does the listener feel something in the first 5 seconds?
- Is the emotional arc clear?

Pass at least 4 out of 5 = good cold open.

## Technical Rules

### Timing
- **Total length**: 25-35 seconds
- **Individual clips**: 3-8 seconds each (no clip under 2 seconds, no clip over 10 seconds)
- **No more than 5-6 clips** (too many quick cuts = disorienting)

### Audio Quality
- **Complete thoughts only** — Even if cut mid-sentence, must be processable
- **Preserve natural speech flow** — Don't create choppy, robotic exchanges
- **Use speaker changes for rhythm** — Back-and-forth creates momentum
- **End on an open question or incomplete thought** — Maximum curiosity

### The Cliffhanger (Non-Negotiable)
Every cold open MUST end with an unresolved moment. This cliffhanger must be 100% verbatim from the transcript.

**Types of cliffhangers:**
- **Unfinished statement**: "So what we do instead is..." [CUT]
- **Unfinished question**: "And the real reason was..." [CUT]
- **Shocking statement with no explanation**: "We were looking at the wrong thing entirely..." [CUT]
- **Promise of revelation**: "But there's one thing nobody talks about..." [CUT]

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ The Scene Selection Trap
**Mistake**: Picking a "important" moment that doesn't actually encapsulate the episode or create curiosity
**Fix**: Ask "Would a stranger care about this?" Pick moments with built-in drama, conflict, or surprise

### ❌ The Chronological Edit
**Mistake**: Arranging clips in the order they appeared in the episode
**Fix**: Deliberately rearrange to tell a different, more dramatic story. Start with the end result, jump to the problem, tease the solution

### ❌ The Exposition Trap
**Mistake**: Explaining who the guest is or why they're talking
**Fix**: Drop listeners in the middle. Let them figure out the context through what's being said

### ❌ The Over-Explanation
**Mistake**: Including too many clips or clips that resolve the tension
**Fix**: Cut ruthlessly. The cold open is not the full story—it's a teaser

### ❌ The Resolution Error
**Mistake**: Ending with the answer or solution revealed
**Fix**: End with a question, a shift, a surprise—something that makes listeners want more

### ❌ The Choppy Cut
**Mistake**: Cutting mid-word or creating unnatural pauses that make the audio feel edited
**Fix**: Cut at natural sentence breaks or at places where the speaker naturally paused

## Key Insight

**A cold open is not:**
- A summary of the episode
- A movie trailer
- An explanation of what's to come
- A highlight reel

**A cold open IS:**
- A scene that encapsulates the episode's themes
- A moment that creates immediate curiosity
- A psychological hook that makes NOT listening feel like a mistake
- An invitation into the middle of something important

If listeners finish your cold open thinking "I need to hear the rest of this episode to understand what's happening," you've succeeded.
