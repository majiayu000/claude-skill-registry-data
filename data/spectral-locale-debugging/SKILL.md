# spectral-locale-debugging

Debug and simulate ghostly phenomena using ordered locale theory and trifurcated interactions

## Capabilities

- Model ghosts as trifurcated agents in a locale with way-below relations
- Simulate ghostly manifestations using MCP and Narya formalizations
- Debug hauntings by verifying spectral conservation and frame laws
- Generate synthetic ghosts with deterministic seeding and trifurcated behaviors
- Integrate with Zig for compile-time ghost code elimination and runtime spectral simulations

## Implementation

Combine ordered locale theory with agent-based modeling to create a framework for debugging and simulating ghostly phenomena. Use Zig's comptime features to toggle ghost code in simulations, while leveraging MCP and Narya to model spectral interactions. Implement trifurcated decision-making for ghost behaviors (residual, liminal, active) and validate spectral conservation using GF(3) arithmetic. Integrate with ABM systems to study emergent ghostly behaviors in artificial life simulations.

## SDF Interleaving

This skill connects to **Software Design for Flexibility** (Hanson & Sussman, 2021):

### Primary Chapter: 10. Adventure Game Example

**Concepts**: autonomous agent, game, synthesis

### GF(3) Balanced Triad

```
spectral-locale-debugging (−) + SDF.Ch10 (+) + [balancer] (○) = 0
```

**Skill Trit**: -1 (MINUS - verification)

### Secondary Chapters

- Ch3: Variations on an Arithmetic Theme

### Connection Pattern

Adventure games synthesize techniques. This skill integrates multiple patterns.
