# Blind Spot Detective

## Purpose

Systematically identify what's missing in non-fiction writing—both blind spots (inherent limitations of your approach) and blank spots (gaps that could be addressed). Provides frameworks for finding omissions, testing assumptions, and ensuring comprehensive coverage.

## Core Principle

**What you can't see matters more than what you can.** Identifying what's missing is harder than recognizing what's included. Systematic interrogation reveals gaps that casual review misses.

## Blind Spots vs. Blank Spots

| Type | Definition | Solution |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Blind Spots** | Limitations inherent to your methodology, theory, or perspective | Adjust your approach or acknowledge limitations |
| **Blank Spots** | Gaps that could be addressed within your current approach | Expand coverage within existing framework |

**Key insight:** Understanding which type of gap you're dealing with determines whether to change your approach or simply expand it.

## Framework 1: Cognitive Bias Check

### Confirmation Bias
Processing information that confirms existing beliefs while ignoring contradictions.

**Self-check:**
- Have I primarily sought sources supporting my views?
- Have I given fair consideration to counter-evidence?
- Am I dismissing perspectives without adequate examination?

### Curse of Knowledge
Assuming readers share your specialized knowledge.

**Self-check:**
- Have I defined specialized terminology?
- Am I assuming background knowledge readers might lack?
- Would someone new to this topic understand?

### Bias Blind Spot
Recognizing biases in others but not yourself.

**Self-check:**
- Have I critically examined my own assumptions?
- Am I applying the same standards to opposing views?
- Have I invited critique from different perspectives?

## Framework 2: Socratic Questioning

| Question Type | Purpose | Examples |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| **Clarification** | Explore complex ideas | What exactly do I mean? How does this relate to my main argument? |
| **Assumption-Probing** | Uncover hidden assumptions | What am I taking for granted? What unstated beliefs underlie this? |
| **Evidence & Reasoning** | Evaluate support quality | What evidence supports this? Is it sufficient? Does my conclusion follow? |
| **Alternative Viewpoints** | Challenge default framework | How would a different discipline view this? What would critics say? |

## Framework 3: Content Checklist

### Thesis Clarity
- Is the main idea clearly stated early?
- Does each section contribute to the main thesis?
- Have I articulated why this topic matters?
- Would a reader easily identify my central argument?

### Structure & Flow
- Does section order make logical sense?
- Are transitions smooth and coherent?
- Is there clear progression of ideas?
- Have I provided signposts for the reader?

### Credibility & Evidence
- Are all claims supported by credible evidence?
- Have I addressed significant counter-arguments?
- Are sources diverse and representative?
- Have I been transparent about methodological limitations?

### Audience Perspective
- Have I considered audience knowledge vs. my knowledge?
- Are technical terms adequately explained?
- Would someone outside my field understand?
- Have I considered diverse reader backgrounds?

## Framework 4: Missing Elements Analysis

### Missing Perspectives
- **Stakeholder gaps:** Whose voice is absent?
- **Cultural gaps:** What cultural perspectives are missing?
- **Historical gaps:** What historical context is omitted?
- **Disciplinary gaps:** What other fields would add insight?

### Missing Content Types
- **Examples:** Are abstract concepts grounded in concrete cases?
- **Counter-examples:** Have I addressed what doesn't fit my thesis?
- **Transitions:** Do ideas flow or jump?
- **Implications:** Have I addressed "so what?"

### Missing Logic
- **Unstated premises:** What assumptions bridge my arguments?
- **Alternative explanations:** What else could explain my evidence?
- **Edge cases:** What situations challenge my generalizations?
- **Causal gaps:** Am I conflating correlation with causation?

## Detection Techniques

### Outsider Test
Read as if you:
- Disagree with your thesis
- Know nothing about the topic
- Come from a different culture
- Work in a different field

### Gap-Finding Questions
- What would a hostile reviewer point out?
- What questions would a curious reader ask?
- What would someone from [different field] notice missing?
- What did I almost include but cut?

### Structural Audit
1. List each section's main claim
2. List evidence supporting each claim
3. List possible objections to each claim
4. Identify which objections you addressed
5. Note unaddressed objections

## Common Blind Spots by Genre

### Academic Writing
- Over-reliance on literature from one tradition
- Ignoring practical implications
- Assuming disciplinary jargon is universal
- Missing interdisciplinary connections

### Business Writing
- Assuming reader shares organizational context
- Overlooking implementation challenges
- Missing stakeholder perspectives
- Ignoring historical precedents

### Self-Help/Advice
- Survivorship bias (only successful examples)
- Ignoring structural barriers
- Assuming universal applicability
- Missing edge cases and exceptions

### Technical Writing
- Curse of knowledge (expert blindness)
- Missing conceptual foundation
- Skipping "obvious" steps
- Ignoring non-technical context

## Remediation Actions

| Gap Type | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Missing evidence | Add sources, examples, or data |
| Missing perspective | Seek input from that group or acknowledge gap |
| Missing logic | Add explicit reasoning or transitions |
| Missing context | Add background or definitions |
| Inherent limitation | Acknowledge in scope statement |

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. The Perfection Paralysis
**Pattern:** Using blind spot detection to delay finishing. Every gap found leads to more analysis. Nothing is ever complete enough.
**Why it fails:** Writing is never perfect. Blind spot detection is for identifying significant omissions, not achieving impossible completeness.
**Fix:** Set a threshold. "I will address gaps that fundamentally undermine my argument, not every possible expansion." Time-box the detection process.

### 2. The Detective Without a Case
**Pattern:** Running blind spot analysis before having a draft. Looking for gaps in something that doesn't exist yet.
**Why it fails:** Blind spot detection works on existing writing. You need something to analyze. Pre-draft gap anxiety prevents ever starting.
**Fix:** Write first, detect second. Get a complete draft, then identify what's missing. Gaps are easier to see in concrete text than abstract plans.

### 3. The Scope Creep Trap
**Pattern:** Treating every identified gap as something to address. Expanding scope until the piece becomes unmanageable.
**Why it fails:** Not every gap needs filling. Some gaps are appropriate for scope. Trying to address everything produces bloated, unfocused writing.
**Fix:** Distinguish blind spots (acknowledge limitation) from blank spots (expand coverage). For each gap, ask: "Is filling this essential to my thesis?"

### 4. The Outside Expertise Dependency
**Pattern:** Believing you need outside experts to identify blind spots. Waiting for external validation instead of systematic self-review.
**Why it fails:** While outside perspectives help, you can identify many blind spots yourself with systematic frameworks. Dependency creates bottlenecks.
**Fix:** Use the frameworks first. Get external review for validation, not discovery. Most obvious gaps can be found with structured self-interrogation.

### 5. The Gap List Without Priorities
**Pattern:** Producing exhaustive lists of missing elements without prioritizing which matter most.
**Why it fails:** A 50-item gap list is paralyzing. Not all gaps are equal. Without priority, writers either give up or address gaps randomly.
**Fix:** Categorize by severity: critical (undermines thesis), significant (weakens argument), minor (would enhance). Address critical first.

## Integration Points

**Inbound:**
- Before finalizing non-fiction writing
- During revision process
- When feedback feels incomplete

**Outbound:**
- To revision and editing
- To additional research
- To scope clarification

**Complementary:**
- `non-fiction-revision`: For implementing fixes
- `summarization`: For testing thesis clarity
- `research`: For filling evidence gaps
