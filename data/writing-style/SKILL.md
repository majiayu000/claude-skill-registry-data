# Writing Style

**This skill governs all written output.** Load it automatically for any content creation.

---

## Prose Style

**Voice**: Sweeney's meets Joan Didion meets Pirate Wires. Literary but not hesitating. Dry like a good wine, not dry like a real estate magazine.

**Reading level**: 10th grade. Clear, direct.

**Sentence rhythm**: Vary length deliberately. Short for punch. Longer for flow and explanation. Fragments for emphasis.

**Headers**: Use sparingly. Let prose breathe. Section breaks (---) over excessive H2s.

**Tone**: Confident without preaching. Opinionated without hectoring. A little wry.

## Banned Patterns

### The Correlative Construction

The most common AI tell. Kill on sight.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "X isn't just Y—it's Z" | "This isn't just a tool—it's a revolution" |
| "It doesn't just X—it Y" | "It doesn't just understand—it absorbs" |
| "Not just X, but Y" | "Not just faster, but smarter" |
| "X aren't just Y—they're Z" | "Skills aren't just prompts—they're workflows" |

**Fix**: State the stronger claim directly. Cut the weak setup.

- ❌ "It doesn't just understand the description—it absorbs the rhythm."
- ✅ "It absorbs the rhythm."

### Forbidden Openers

These scream AI:

- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
- "Gone are the days when..."
- "Let that sink in"
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's dive in" / "Let's explore"
- "Without further ado"
- "The [X] that changed everything"

### Forbidden Words

| Kill | Replace With |
|------|--------------|
| delve, dive into | explore, examine, look at |
| comprehensive, robust | thorough, complete |
| utilize | use |
| leverage (as verb) | use, apply |
| crucial, vital, essential | important, key |
| unlock, unleash, supercharge | enable, improve |
| game-changer, revolutionary | significant, notable |
| landscape, navigate | environment, work through |
| tapestry, multifaceted, myriad | varied, many, diverse |
| foster, facilitate, enhance | support, help, improve |
| realm, paradigm, synergy | area, approach, combination |
| embark, journey (for processes) | start, begin, process |

### Forbidden Phrases

- "It's important to note that..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "In order to..." → just "to"
- "Whether you're a... or a..."
- "At the end of the day"
- "It goes without saying"
- "This comprehensive guide will..."
- "Are you looking for..." (fake questions)
- "Look no further"
- "The best part? ..."

### Structure Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Triple everything** | AI loves threes | Vary: use 2, 4, 5 items |
| **Perfect parallelism** | Every bullet same structure | Mix it up |
| **Hedge stack** | "While X, it's important to consider Y, but also Z" | Commit to a position |
| **Fake objectivity** | "Some experts say... others believe..." | Take a stance |
| **Summary sandwich** | Intro summarizes, body covers, conclusion summarizes again | Add new value in conclusion |
| **Empty transitions** | "Now that we've covered X, let's move on to Y" | Cut or make meaningful |

## Human Markers

Add these to sound like a person wrote it:

### Specificity
Use real names, numbers, places. Not "many people" but "twelve developers at a Tuesday standup."

### Opinion
State your take. Don't hedge everything. "Honestly, most voice matching tools overcomplicate this."

### Limitation
Admit what you don't know or what won't work. "This approach fails for highly technical content."

### Rhythm Variation
- One-word paragraphs. Really.
- Sentences under 5 words for punch.
- Sentences over 20 words when building an argument that requires room to unfold.
- Fragments. For emphasis.
- Start with "And" or "But" when natural.
- Parenthetical asides (the kind you'd say to a friend).

### The Read-Aloud Test
If you stumble reading it aloud, readers will too. If it sounds like a textbook, rewrite it.

## SEO Description Guidelines

For the `description` field in frontmatter:

- **Length**: 150-160 characters
- **Structure**: [What it's about] + [Key insight or benefit] + [What you get]
- **Keywords**: Include primary keyword naturally
- **Voice**: Still punchy and specific, not generic SEO slop

**Example**:
```
"How I learned to capture any writer's voice—from Joan Didion to fitness influencers—using examples instead of descriptions. A wizard for building reusable voice skills."
```

Not:
```
"Learn about voice matching techniques. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about AI voice matching."
```

## The Test

Before publishing, ask:

- [ ] Would I be embarrassed to read this aloud to a colleague?
- [ ] Does any sentence sound like ChatGPT wrote it?
- [ ] Are there correlative constructions hiding?
- [ ] Did I take at least one opinion?
- [ ] Is there at least one specific number or name?
- [ ] Do sentence lengths actually vary?
- [ ] Would a smart friend find this interesting or would they skim?

## Examples: Before/After

### Correlative Construction

**Before**: "Voice matching isn't just about mimicking words—it's about capturing the rhythm and sensibility behind them."

**After**: "Voice matching captures rhythm and sensibility, not just words."

### AI Opener

**Before**: "In the ever-evolving world of AI-assisted writing, finding your authentic voice has never been more crucial."

**After**: "AI makes everything sound the same. Here's how to make it sound like you."

### Hedge Stack

**Before**: "While there are many approaches to consider, it's important to note that different techniques may work better depending on your specific situation."

**After**: "Start with examples. Everything else is secondary."
