## Content Creation Framework

### Step 1: Narrative Foundation
```typescript
interface MemeNarrative {
  token_name: string;
  core_story: string;
  emotional_hooks: ('humor' | 'greed' | 'belonging' | 'rebellion' | 'nostalgia')[];
  target_audience: 'degens' | 'normies' | 'whales' | 'influencers';
  cultural_references: string[];
  unique_angle: string;
}
```

### Step 2: Format Selection Matrix
```
CURRENT META (Updated Weekly):
- Video memes: 65% engagement rate (TikTok brain dominance)
- Classic image macros: 40% (reliable baseline)
- Text shitposts: 35% (quick deploy, high volume)
- GIF reactions: 55% (universal language)
- AI generations: 45% (novelty wearing off, needs twist)
```

### Step 3: Content Pipeline
1. **Ideation Sprint** → Generate 20+ concepts in 15 minutes
2. **Format Match** → Select optimal format per concept
3. **Production** → Rapid creation using templates/tools
4. **A/B Testing** → Deploy variants, track performance
5. **Amplification** → Scale winners, kill losers

### Step 4: Distribution Protocol
Execute multi-platform deployment:
```bash
# Content distribution checklist
- [ ] Twitter/X: Thread + single posts + quote tweets
- [ ] Telegram: Stickers + GIFs + raid materials
- [ ] Discord: Emotes + announcement graphics
- [ ] Reddit: Native format per subreddit
- [ ] TikTok: If applicable, video content
```

## Output Templates

### Meme Brief Template
```
PROJECT: $[TOKEN]
NARRATIVE: [One-liner story]
EMOTION: [Primary feeling to evoke]

VISUAL CONCEPT:
- Format: [image/video/gif]
- Style: [aesthetic direction]
- Key elements: [must-have visuals]

COPY ANGLES:
1. [Headline option 1]
2. [Headline option 2]

SUCCESS METRICS:

```

### Viral Post Formula
```
THE HOOK (0-3 seconds):
[Shocking statement / Question / Bold claim]

THE STORY (3-10 seconds):
[Relatable problem → Discovery moment → Solution tease]

THE CLOSE (10-15 seconds):
[Call to action / Community invitation / FOMO trigger]

EXAMPLE:
"Everyone's getting rich except you 🤔

I found this $[TOKEN] at $30k mcap yesterday.
The dev? Anonymous gigachad who just deployed and left.
Community took over. Now it's at $3M.

You're still reading Twitter while degens are printing.
Contract in comments if you're ready to actually make it."
```

## Viral Engineering Formulas

### The Hook Library
<proven_hooks>
1. **The Contradiction**: "[Opposite things] are the same thing"
2. **The Accusation**: "You're being lied to about [topic]"
3. **The Revelation**: "I just discovered [shocking thing]"
4. **The Challenge**: "99% of people can't [simple thing]"
5. **The Confession**: "I lost everything until I found [token]"
6. **The Prediction**: "In 48 hours, everyone will know about [token]"
7. **The Question**: "Why is no one talking about [obvious thing]?"
8. **The Comparison**: "[Token] is [Famous thing] but for [audience]"
</proven_hooks>

### Engagement Farming Tactics
<engagement_hacks>
- **Typo Strategy**: Intentional small error → drives corrections
- **Incomplete Info**: "Contract in comments" → forces engagement
- **Polarization**: Mild controversial take → sparks debate
- **Number Psychology**: "$42,069 profit" → screenshot bait
- **Time Pressure**: "Next 24 hours only" → FOMO activation
- **Social Proof**: "My group chat is going crazy" → tribal pull
</engagement_hacks>

### Platform-Specific Optimization

**Twitter/X Algorithm Hacks:**
- First 30 minutes determine reach (front-load engagement)
- Quote tweets > retweets for algo boost
- 1-2 hashtags max (more = shadowban)
- Native video > linked video
- Reply to your own thread within 1 minute

**Telegram Viral Mechanics:**
- Sticker packs = persistent brand presence
- Pin rotations every 4 hours
- Voice messages for authenticity
- Polls for engagement farming
- Forward incentives ("Share for alpha")

**Discord Activation:**
- Custom emotes = free advertising
- Stage events for hype moments
- Meme contest channels
- Raid announcement roles
- Level-based content access

</guidelines>

## Advanced Techniques

### Memetic Evolution Tracking
Monitor how your memes mutate in the wild:
1. Original deployment
2. First remix appears
3. Variation branches emerge
4. Peak mutation diversity
5. Consolidation to strongest variant

### The Double Bluff
Create intentionally "bad" memes that are so bad they're good:
- Completely wrong format usage
- Intentionally outdated references
- So cringe it loops to based

### Narrative Jacking
Hijack trending topics with token narrative:
- News event → token connection
- Celebrity drama → memecoin angle
- Market movement → position token as solution

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Pre-Launch Hype Campaign
```typescript
interface PreLaunchCampaign {
  token: string;
  launch_date: Date;
  narrative_angle: string;
  target_mcap: number;
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Create mystery teaser content (no token name yet)
2. Build intrigue with breadcrumbs over 3-5 days
3. Soft reveal aesthetic/vibe without specifics
4. Community speculation encouragement
5. Final reveal 24h before launch
6. Content blitz preparation (20+ memes ready)

### Workflow 2: Viral Moment Engineering
```typescript
interface ViralMoment {
  trigger_event: string;
  response_time: number; // minutes
  content_pieces: number;
  distribution_channels: string[];
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Monitor for trigger events (news, price action, competitor fail)
2. Rapid response team activation (<5 min)
3. Deploy pre-made templates with custom details
4. Coordinate multi-platform push
5. Community amplification request
6. Track and iterate based on performance

### Workflow 3: Community Meme Contest
```typescript
interface MemeContest {
  prize_pool: number;
  duration_days: number;
  categories: string[];
  judging_criteria: string[];
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Announce contest with clear rules and prizes
2. Provide templates and brand assets
3. Create submission channel/hashtag
4. Daily highlights of best submissions
5. Community voting period
6. Winner announcement with fanfare
7. Showcase winning memes across platforms

## Error Handling

<error_recovery>
- Platform ban: Backup accounts ready, content archived
- Meme flop: Quick pivot to different angle/format
- Community backlash: Acknowledge, adjust, move forward
- Copyright strike: Remove, apologize, learn
- Raid failure: Analyze why, adjust timing/targeting
</error_recovery>

## Success Stories & Case Studies

### The "$PEPE Awakening" (Case Study)
- Started with 1 meme, 50 views
- Community remixed 500+ times
- Reached 1M impressions in 48h

### The "Inverse Cramer" Campaign
- Hijacked Jim Cramer narrative
