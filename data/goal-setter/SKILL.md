# Goal Setter

The Goal Setter skill guides you through creating well-formed, achievable goals and maintaining accountability throughout your journey. Unlike generic goal-setting tools, this skill uses evidence-based frameworks to help you craft goals that are specific, measurable, and aligned with your deeper values.

This skill applies the SMART framework, backward planning, and milestone tracking to transform vague aspirations into concrete action plans. It helps you identify potential obstacles before they derail you, build in accountability mechanisms, and create feedback loops that keep you on track.

The process is designed to be both rigorous and supportive—asking hard questions about feasibility and commitment while celebrating progress and helping you adjust when circumstances change.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Goal Creation
1. **Aspiration Clarification**: Explores what you really want and why it matters
2. **SMART Refinement**: Transforms vague wishes into specific, measurable objectives
3. **Timeline Design**: Sets realistic deadlines with interim milestones
4. **Obstacle Identification**: Anticipates challenges and plans mitigation strategies
5. **Resource Assessment**: Identifies what you need (time, money, skills, support)
6. **Accountability Setup**: Creates tracking mechanisms and accountability structures
7. **First Action**: Defines the immediate next step to build momentum

### Workflow 2: Goal Review & Progress Check
1. **Progress Assessment**: Reviews what's been accomplished
2. **Obstacle Analysis**: Identifies what's blocking progress
3. **Plan Adjustment**: Modifies timeline or approach as needed
4. **Motivation Renewal**: Reconnects with the "why" behind the goal
5. **Next Actions**: Defines clear next steps

### Workflow 3: Goal Breakdown
For large or complex goals:
1. **Milestone Mapping**: Breaks goal into 3-5 major milestones
2. **Action Planning**: Converts milestones into actionable tasks
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Identifies what needs to happen first
4. **Quick Wins**: Highlights early victories to build momentum

### Workflow 4: Goal Reset or Abandon
When goals need adjustment:
1. **Honest Assessment**: Evaluates if goal is still relevant/feasible
2. **Pivot Options**: Explores modifications vs. abandonment
3. **Lesson Extraction**: Captures learnings for future goals
4. **Graceful Exit**: Helps you let go without guilt when appropriate

## Goal Frameworks

### SMART Criteria
Every goal should be:
- **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous target
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable success criteria
- **Achievable**: Realistic given resources and constraints
- **Relevant**: Aligned with broader life/career objectives
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadline or timeframe

### The Three Levels

**Outcome Goal**: The ultimate result you want
- Example: "Run a marathon"

**Performance Goal**: Measurable markers of progress
- Example: "Run 10K in under 60 minutes by June"

**Process Goal**: Daily/weekly behaviors that drive progress
- Example: "Run 3x per week, gradually increasing distance"

### Backward Planning Method
1. Start with the end: When do you want this completed?
2. Work backward: What needs to happen the month before? The week before?
3. Identify dependencies: What must be done before other things can start?
4. Find the starting point: What can you do today?

DEADLINE: [Target completion date]

THIS WEEK'S PROGRESS:
✓ [What got done]
✓ [What got done]

OBSTACLES ENCOUNTERED:
- [Challenge 1]
- [Challenge 2]

ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED:
- [Change 1]

GOAL: [Goal Name]

MILESTONE 1: [Description] - Target: [Date]
Status: [ ] Not Started / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Complete
Key Actions:
- [ ] Action 1
- [ ] Action 2

MILESTONE 2: [Description] - Target: [Date]
Status: [ ] Not Started / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Complete
Key Actions:
- [ ] Action 1
- [ ] Action 2

[Continue for all milestones...]

OVERALL PROGRESS: [X]% Complete

```

## Best Practices

- **Start with why** - Goals without strong motivation rarely succeed
- **Make it visible** - Track progress where you'll see it daily
- **Share selectively** - Tell people who will support, not judge
- **Celebrate milestones** - Progress deserves recognition
- **Review regularly** - Weekly check-ins prevent drift
- **Stay flexible** - Adjust methods, not destination
- **Focus on process** - Control the inputs, not just outcomes
- **Build habits first** - Consistent small actions beat sporadic heroics
- **Measure what matters** - Track leading indicators, not just results
- **Plan for obstacles** - "If-then" planning improves follow-through
- **Avoid too many goals** - 1-3 major goals at a time is sustainable
- **Make it specific** - "Get better at X" is not a goal
- **Set learning goals** - Embrace growth, not just achievement
- **Design accountability** - External commitment increases completion rates
- **Reflect on failures** - Every setback contains useful data

## Common Goal-Setting Pitfalls

### Too Vague
❌ "Get in shape"
✓ "Complete a 5K run in under 30 minutes by September 1st"

### Too Ambitious
❌ "Write a novel in one month"
✓ "Write 500 words daily for 3 months to complete first draft"

### No Accountability
❌ Just writing it down
✓ Weekly progress sharing with accountability partner

### All Outcome, No Process
❌ "Lose 20 pounds"
✓ "Exercise 4x/week and track calories daily"

### No Milestone Tracking
❌ "Launch business by year-end"
✓ "MVP by June, 10 beta users by August, public launch by November"

## Integration Points

This skill works well with:
- **Daily Planner**: Connect daily actions to longer-term goals
- **Habit Tracker**: Build process goals into daily routines
- **Learning Path Creator**: Structure skill acquisition goals
- **Journal Prompter**: Reflect on goal progress and obstacles
- **Decision Helper**: Evaluate choices against goal alignment

## Example Goal Setting Session

**User**: "set a goal"

**Skill Response**:
"Let's create a goal that's both ambitious and achievable. I'll guide you through a proven framework.

First, tell me: What do you want to accomplish? Don't worry about making it perfect yet—just share the general idea or aspiration."

**User**: "I want to get better at public speaking"

**Skill Response**:
"Great aspiration. Public speaking is a valuable skill. Let's make this more specific and actionable.

Questions to sharpen this goal:

1. **What does 'better' look like specifically?**
   - Deliver presentations without notes?
   - Speak at conferences?
   - Lead team meetings confidently?
   - Reduce anxiety/nervousness?

2. **What's your current baseline?**
   - How often do you speak publicly now?
   - What situations feel manageable vs. challenging?

3. **What would success look like in 3-6 months?**

4. **Why is this important to you right now?**

Take your time with these—specificity is where goal-setting magic happens."
