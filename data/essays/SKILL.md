As a complete beginner to Typescript, I found that it is easier to learn than the previous languages that I learned. I have found that learning languages has gotten easier with each language that I start to learn. When I first started the ICS program at UH Manoa, we were learning Java and I felt completely out of my depth, everyone around me seemed to know what they were doing but I didn’t understand anything that was being taught. It took me until later in the semester to grasp some of the key concepts needed to succeed in the class. Given how much I struggled that semester with learning Java, I was dreading the next classes having to take the next classes which were moving to new languages like C++ and Python.

However, I found that that learning those languages did not come with as much difficulty as the first one. I found that I was focusing on areas that I found the be crucial when learning Java and that I was picking things up faster than I did last semester. I was taking more efficient steps when studying concepts, which made me realize that I had gotten better at learning languages. Just like any skill, the way to grow is by practicing it; and the only way you practice learning is by learning more skills.

A skill that I believe I need to work on is working under pressure, during timed coding practices and the first timed coding assessment of my software engineering class, I found I work significantly worse when under pressure. I found myself forgetting very basic things that would have aided in my ability to perform, for example, I forgot that I could Copy and Paste when doing my first timed coding assessment. This is not just in programming, but also in games and sports I find my thinking and problem solving skills degrade when not in a relaxed mindset. I will continue working on this skill throughout my entire life until I get better at it.

Learning is a skill that you need to develop and the only way to get better at it, is by continuing to learn.
