# Brand Voice Coach

Define, document, and maintain a consistent brand voice that makes your content instantly recognizable. This skill helps you articulate what your brand sounds like, train teams to write on-brand, and ensure consistency across every touchpoint.

A strong brand voice builds trust, differentiates from competitors, and creates emotional connection. This skill provides frameworks for defining voice attributes, creating practical guidelines, and evaluating content against brand standards. Turn abstract brand essence into concrete writing principles anyone can follow.

Built for brand managers, content strategists, marketing leaders, and anyone responsible for maintaining brand consistency across teams and channels.

## Best Practices

- **Be specific** - "Friendly" is vague; "Like a knowledgeable friend, not a salesperson" is clear
- **Three to five attributes** - More becomes unmanageable
- **Show, don't tell** - Examples matter more than descriptions
- **Context flexibility** - Voice stays constant, tone adapts
- **Train regularly** - Voice drifts without maintenance
- **Create checklists** - Make self-assessment easy
- **Involve stakeholders** - Voice must work across functions
- **Test with audience** - Validate voice resonates
- **Document exceptions** - When rules should be broken
- **Review competitors** - Ensure differentiation
- **Update intentionally** - Voice evolves, but deliberately
- **Measure consistency** - Audit periodically
- **Celebrate on-brand** - Recognize great examples
- **Correct gently** - Off-brand happens; coach constructively
- **Keep it alive** - Voice guidelines should be used, not shelved
