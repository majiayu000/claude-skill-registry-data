# Learning Journey Builder

## Overview

The Learning Journey Builder skill helps design complete learning ecosystems that extend far beyond the workshop. It integrates formal training (10%), work-based learning (70%), and social learning (20%) into cohesive journeys.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing complete 6-week or longer learning programs
- Creating stretch assignments and work-based practice
- Planning coaching and peer learning structures
- Building communities of practice
- Designing sustained learning pathways
- Mapping workflow integration for new skills
- Planning for application support post-training

## 70:20:10 Model Overview

**70% - Work-Based Learning**
- Real projects and stretch assignments
- Graduated complexity over time
- Peer collaboration on actual work
- Just-in-time support when stuck

**20% - Social Learning**
- Embedded coaching (1-on-1 or manager-led)
- Peer learning and pair programming
- Communities of practice
- Retrospectives and reflection

**10% - Formal Training**
- Workshop (just-enough content)
- Online learning (supplemental, job aids)
- Quick references and on-demand support

## Journey Design Components

1. **Kickoff**: Workshop that frames all learning
2. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Coached work, high support
3. **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6)**: More independent, peer collaboration
4. **Phase 3 (Weeks 7+)**: Sustained practice, lower support
5. **Measurement**: Continuous tracking of application and results

## Integration with Other Skills

- **training-designer**: Use together to design sessions
- **training-reviewer**: Validate materials
- **training-content-creator**: Generate actual content
- Use these alongside **learning-journey-builder** for complete programs

## Best Practices

✅ **Do**:
- Focus on learner outcomes and business impact
- Use real work examples and scenarios
- Design for application, not knowledge recall
- Measure what matters

❌ **Don't**:
- Train what doesn't drive behavior change
- Use simulated practice over real work
- Over-design solutions for simple problems
- Ignore the business context
