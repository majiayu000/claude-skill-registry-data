# OpenWebF Host: Hybrid Routing (WebFSubView + go_router)

## Instructions

1. Detect whether the project uses `go_router` and whether `WebFSubView` exists (via project profile and code search).
2. Define the desired route mapping (Flutter path → WebF path) and layout responsibilities.
3. Use MCP docs for recommended patterns and constraints.
4. Offer the routing scaffold template when appropriate (`routing/go-router-webfsubview`).
