name: Frontend Responsive
description: Build responsive, mobile-first user interfaces that adapt gracefully across all screen sizes using fluid layouts, relative units, breakpoints, and optimized assets. Use this skill when creating or modifying UI layouts, responsive components, CSS media queries, or any code that needs to adapt to different viewport sizes. Use this when implementing mobile-first designs, adding responsive breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop), using relative units (rem/em), ensuring touch-friendly tap targets, optimizing images for different screen sizes, testing across multiple devices, or making typography readable on all screens. Use this when working on layout components, grid systems, or any UI code that should respond to screen size changes.
