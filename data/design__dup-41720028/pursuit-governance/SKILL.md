# Pursuit Governance Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- Launching complex pursuits with multiple internal workstreams.
- Preparing executive steering updates for strategic deals.
- Standardizing standups, decision logs, and risk reviews across regions.

## Framework
1. **Cadence Matrix** – define daily standups, weekly exec reviews, and async updates per workstream.
2. **Decision Log** – capture requests, approvals, and rationale with timestamps and owners.
3. **Escalation Paths** – map issue severity to escalation channels (CRO, legal, product, finance).
4. **Communication Kit** – templates for updates, dashboards, and summaries.
5. **Retrospective Loop** – schedule debriefs and feed insights back into playbooks.

## Templates
- Pursuit governance calendar.
- Decision log sheet (request, owner, status, timestamp).
- Escalation matrix with contacts and SLAs.

## Tips
- Keep cadences lightweight; combine workstreams where possible to avoid meeting overload.
- Use a shared workspace (Notion, Asana, Sheets) for transparency.
- Pair with `risk-register` to ensure escalations include mitigation details.
