# Enterprise Risk Register Skill

## When to Use
- During enterprise pursuits with multiple high-stakes dependencies.
- Preparing executive updates or steering committee reviews.
- Handing off deals between pursuit phases or regions.

## Framework
1. **Risk Catalog** – categorize by workstream (value, product, legal, security, executive, finance).
2. **Scoring** – likelihood x impact, color-coded with thresholds for escalation.
3. **Mitigation Plan** – define owner, action, due date, and supporting resources.
4. **Watchlist & Escalation** – highlight items nearing deadlines or requiring CRO/exec attention.
5. **Retrospective** – update playbooks with resolved risks + guidance.

## Templates
- Risk register table (risk, category, score, owner, mitigation, status).
- Weekly summary slide for executive steering meetings.
- Escalation request form with context + proposed action.

## Tips
- Keep risk statements precise (impact + trigger) to aid decision-making.
- Default to weekly updates; high-risk deals may require twice-weekly cadences.
- Align scoring with `pursuit-governance` to maintain consistent reporting.
