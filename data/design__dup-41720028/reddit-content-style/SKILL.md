# Reddit Content Style Guide

## Tone
- Casual, conversational
- Avoid corporate/marketing speak
- Use subreddit-specific jargon when appropriate

## Structure
- Lead with value or hook
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)
- Use line breaks liberally

## What Works
- Personal anecdotes ("I tried this and...")
- Questions that invite discussion
- Specific details over generic statements

## What to Avoid
- Excessive emojis
- ALL CAPS (except sparingly)
- Self-promotion without value
- Generic responses ("Great post!")

## Example Good Comment
"Been using X for about 6 months now. The learning curve was rough the first week but honestly it's saved me hours. One tip: disable the auto-update feature, it breaks things."
