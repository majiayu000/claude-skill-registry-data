# CSS Development: Refactor

## Overview

Transforms existing CSS into semantic component patterns:
- Extract inline styles to semantic classes
- Consolidate utility classes from markup into `@apply` compositions
- Add dark mode variants
- Add test coverage
- Preserve existing functionality (behavior-neutral refactoring)

**This is a sub-skill of `css-development`** - typically invoked automatically via the main skill.

## When This Skill Applies

Use when:
- Converting inline styles to semantic classes
- Extracting repeated utility combinations from markup
- Migrating from pure utility-first to semantic components
- Adding dark mode to existing CSS
- Cleaning up scattered or duplicated CSS

## Pattern Reference

This skill refactors toward patterns documented in the main `css-development` skill:

**Semantic naming:** `.button-primary` not `.btn-blue`
**Tailwind composition:** Use `@apply` to compose utilities
**Dark mode:** Include `dark:` variants
**Composition first:** Reuse existing classes before creating new
**Test coverage:** Static CSS + component rendering tests

## Workflow

When this skill is invoked, create a TodoWrite checklist and refactor systematically.

### Announce Usage

"I'm using the css-development:refactor skill to transform this CSS into semantic component patterns."

### Create TodoWrite Checklist

Use the TodoWrite tool:

```
Refactoring CSS:
- [ ] Analyze existing CSS (identify what needs refactoring)
- [ ] Find repeated patterns (look for duplicated utility combinations)
- [ ] Check existing components (see if patterns already exist)
- [ ] Extract to semantic classes (create new classes using @apply)
- [ ] Include dark mode (add dark: variants to new classes)
- [ ] Update markup (replace inline/utility classes with semantic names)
- [ ] Add tests (write static CSS and rendering tests)
- [ ] Document components (add usage comments)
- [ ] Verify behavior unchanged (ensure visual output matches original)
```

### Refactoring Checklist Details

#### Step 1: Analyze Existing CSS

**Action:** Read and understand the CSS that needs refactoring

**Look for:**
- Inline styles in component files
- Repeated utility class combinations in markup
- CSS scattered across multiple files
- Missing dark mode support
- Lack of semantic class names

**Example patterns to refactor:**

```tsx
// Inline styles
<button style={{ background: 'indigo', padding: '1.5rem 2rem' }}>Click</button>

// Repeated utilities in markup
<button class="bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-700 px-6 py-3 rounded-lg text-white">
  Click me
</button>
<button class="bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-700 px-6 py-3 rounded-lg text-white">
  Submit
</button>

// Non-semantic CSS
.btn-blue {
  background: blue;
  padding: 12px 24px;
}
```

**Capture:**
- File locations
- Pattern frequency (how many times repeated)
- Current approach (inline, utilities, old CSS)

**Mark as completed** when analysis is done.

---

#### Step 2: Find Repeated Patterns

**Action:** Identify duplicated utility combinations that should become semantic classes

**Use Grep tool** to search for repeated patterns:

```bash
# Search for common utility combinations
grep -r "bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-700 px-6 py-3" .
grep -r "rounded-lg shadow-md p-6" .
```

**Categorize patterns:**
- **High frequency** (5+ occurrences): Definitely extract
- **Medium frequency** (2-4 occurrences): Probably extract
- **Low frequency** (1 occurrence): Keep as-is or compose existing classes

**For each pattern:**
- Count occurrences
- List file locations
- Identify semantic purpose (is this a button? card? badge?)

**Mark as completed** when patterns are cataloged.

---

#### Step 3: Check Existing Components

**Action:** Read `styles/components.css` to see if patterns already exist

**Before creating new classes, check:**
- Does a similar class already exist?
- Can existing classes be composed?
- Would a variant of an existing class work?

**Example:**
```
Pattern found: bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-700 px-6 py-3 rounded-lg text-white
Check: Does .button-primary already exist? YES
Solution: Use .button-primary instead of creating new class
```

**Decision for each pattern:**
- ✅ Use existing class as-is
- ✅ Compose existing classes
- ✅ Create variant of existing class
- ⚠️ Create new class (only if no existing solution)

**Mark as completed** when reuse opportunities are identified.

---

#### Step 4: Extract to Semantic Classes

**Action:** Create new semantic classes in `styles/components.css` for patterns that need extraction

**For each pattern being extracted:**

1. **Choose semantic name** following existing patterns
2. **Write CSS class** using `@apply`
3. **Include dark mode** variants
4. **Add documentation** comment

**Example extraction:**

**Before (in markup):**
```tsx
<button class="bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-700 px-6 py-3 rounded-lg text-white transition-all duration-200">
  Click me
</button>
```

**After (in components.css):**
```css
/* Primary button - Main call-to-action button with hover states
   Usage: <button className="button-primary">Click me</button> */
.button-primary {
  @apply bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-700 dark:bg-indigo-600 dark:hover:bg-indigo-800;
  @apply px-6 py-3 rounded-lg text-white;
  @apply transition-all duration-200;
}
```

**Use Edit tool** to add each new class to components.css

**Mark as completed** when all semantic classes are created.

---

#### Step 5: Include Dark Mode

**Action:** Ensure all new/refactored classes have `dark:` variants

**For each class created in Step 4:**
- Add `dark:` variants for backgrounds
- Add `dark:` variants for text colors
- Add `dark:` variants for borders
- Test in dark mode (if possible)

**Pattern:**
```css
.component {
  @apply bg-white dark:bg-gray-800;
  @apply text-gray-900 dark:text-white;
  @apply border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700;
}
```

**Mark as completed** when dark mode coverage is added.

---

#### Step 6: Update Markup

**Action:** Replace inline styles and utility classes with semantic class names

**For each file using the old pattern:**

1. **Read the file** with Read tool
2. **Use Edit tool** to replace old pattern with semantic class
3. **Verify** the replacement is correct

**Example:**

**Before:**
```tsx
<button class="bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-700 px-6 py-3 rounded-lg text-white">
  Click me
</button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<button class="button-primary">
  Click me
</button>
```

**Handle custom classes:**
```tsx
<!-- If there were additional custom classes, preserve them -->
<button class="button-primary w-full mt-4">
  Click me
</button>
```

**Track changes:**
- Count files updated
- Count instances replaced
- Note any edge cases

**Mark as completed** when all markup is updated.

---

#### Step 7: Add Tests

**Action:** Add test coverage for refactored components

**Static CSS test** in `styles/__tests__/components.test.ts`:
```typescript
it('should have button-primary class', () => {
  const content = readFileSync('styles/components.css', 'utf-8');
  expect(content).toContain('.button-primary');
});

it('should have dark mode variants in button-primary', () => {
  const content = readFileSync('styles/components.css', 'utf-8');
  expect(content).toContain('dark:bg-indigo');
});
```

**Component rendering test** (if applicable):
```typescript
it('applies button-primary class after refactor', () => {
  render(<Button variant="primary">Click</Button>);
  expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveClass('button-primary');
});
```

**Run tests** to ensure they pass:
```bash
npm test
```

**Mark as completed** when tests are added and passing.

---

#### Step 8: Document Components

**Action:** Ensure all refactored classes have documentation

**Documentation includes:**
- Comment in CSS explaining purpose
- Usage example
- Migration notes (if helpful)

**Example:**
```css
/* Primary button - Main CTA button (refactored from inline utilities)
   Usage: <button className="button-primary">Click me</button>
   Replaces: bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-700 px-6 py-3 rounded-lg text-white */
.button-primary {
  @apply bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-700 dark:bg-indigo-600 dark:hover:bg-indigo-800;
  @apply px-6 py-3 rounded-lg text-white;
  @apply transition-all duration-200;
}
```

**Mark as completed** when documentation is added.

---

#### Step 9: Verify Behavior Unchanged

**Action:** Ensure visual output and behavior match the original

**Verification steps:**

1. **Run tests** (if project has them):
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Visual inspection** (if possible):
   - Start dev server
   - Check refactored components look the same
   - Test in light and dark mode
   - Test interactive states (hover, focus, active)

3. **Check for regressions:**
   - Compare before/after screenshots (if available)
   - Verify no console errors
   - Check responsive behavior

**If behavior changed:**
- Identify the difference
- Fix the semantic class to match original behavior
- Re-test

**Behavior must be preserved** - refactoring should be visually neutral

**Mark as completed** when behavior is verified unchanged.
