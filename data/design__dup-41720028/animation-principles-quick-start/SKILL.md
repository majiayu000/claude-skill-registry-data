# 12 Animation Principles in 5 Minutes

The Disney animators codified these principles in the 1930s. They still define quality animation today.

## The Principles (30 seconds each)

**1. Squash and Stretch**
Objects compress on impact, elongate in motion. A bouncing ball flattens when it hits ground. Gives life and flexibility.

**2. Anticipation**
Wind-up before action. Crouch before jump. Arm back before throw. Prepares the viewer for what's coming.

**3. Staging**
Present ideas clearly. One idea per shot. The viewer should never wonder where to look.

**4. Straight Ahead / Pose to Pose**
Two animation methods. Straight ahead: draw frame by frame for fluid, spontaneous motion. Pose to pose: draw key frames first for controlled, planned action.

**5. Follow Through / Overlapping Action**
Things don't stop all at once. Hair keeps moving after head stops. Different parts move at different rates.

**6. Slow In and Slow Out**
Movement accelerates and decelerates. More drawings at start and end, fewer in middle. Creates natural weight.

**7. Arc**
Natural motion follows curved paths. Arms swing in arcs. Heads turn in arcs. Straight lines feel robotic.

**8. Secondary Action**
Supporting movements that add richness. Walking while whistling. Talking while gesturing. Enhances without distracting.

**9. Timing**
Number of frames = speed and weight. Fewer frames = faster/lighter. More frames = slower/heavier.

**10. Exaggeration**
Push reality further for impact. Bigger expressions, more dynamic poses. Animation isn't reality - it's reality enhanced.

**11. Solid Drawing**
Three-dimensional thinking. Weight, balance, anatomy. Even 2D characters should feel like they have volume.

**12. Appeal**
Charisma in design. Characters should be interesting to watch. Clear shapes, good proportions, distinctive features.

## Quick Reference Groups

**Make it move right:** Timing, Arcs, Slow In/Out, Squash/Stretch
**Make it feel alive:** Follow Through, Overlapping, Secondary Action
**Make it read clearly:** Staging, Anticipation
**Make it compelling:** Appeal, Exaggeration, Solid Drawing

## The Only Exercise You Need to Start
Animate a bouncing ball. It teaches Timing, Squash/Stretch, Arcs, and Slow In/Out simultaneously.
