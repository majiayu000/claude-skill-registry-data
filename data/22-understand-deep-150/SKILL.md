# Understand-Deep 150 Protocol

**Core Principle:** Research deeply from ALL sources — internal context AND external knowledge. Don't limit yourself to one world.

## What This Skill Does

When you invoke this skill, you're researching from TWO worlds:

**🏠 INTERNAL (Project Context)**
- Code — what's already implemented
- Git history — why and when things changed
- Logs — what actually happened
- Config — how things are set up

**🌍 EXTERNAL (World Knowledge)**
- Web search — how others solved similar problems
- Documentation — official guidance and specs
- Best practices — established patterns
- Community — Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, forums

## The Two Worlds of Research

```
🏠 INTERNAL (Project Context)        🌍 EXTERNAL (World Knowledge)
├── Code files                       ├── Web search
├── Git history/blame                ├── Official documentation
├── Comments & inline docs           ├── Stack Overflow / forums
├── Config files                     ├── Blog posts & tutorials
├── Tests (expected behavior)        ├── GitHub issues/discussions
├── Logs (actual behavior)           ├── Best practice guides
└── Project documentation            └── Comparison articles
```

**Key Insight:** Most questions need BOTH worlds. Internal tells you "what we have", external tells you "what's possible".

## The 150% Research Rule

- **100% Core:** Research from primary relevant sources (internal OR external depending on question)
- **50% Enhancement:** Cross-check with the OTHER world (if started internal → check external, vice versa)

## Real-World Research Scenarios

| Scenario | Internal Research | External Research |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Choosing a library** | What's already used? Conflicts? | Comparisons, benchmarks, community health |
| **Legal question** | Context, contracts, history | Laws, regulations, precedents |
| **Architecture decision** | Current structure, constraints | Patterns, case studies, trade-offs |
| **Bug investigation** | Code, logs, git blame | Known issues, similar problems |
| **Performance optimization** | Profiling, bottlenecks | Best practices, techniques |
| **Security concern** | Current implementation | Vulnerabilities, OWASP, CVEs |

## When to Use Which Source

### 🔍 **Understanding Existing Code**
| Question | Best Source | Tools* |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| "What does this code do?" | Read the code | `read_file`, `grep` |
| "Why was it written this way?" | Git blame/history | `git log`, `git blame` |
| "When did this change?" | Git history | `git log --follow` |
| "What was the original intent?" | Commits + PR descriptions | `git show`, `git log` |

### 🌐 **Finding Solutions**
| Question | Best Source | Tools* |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| "How do others solve X?" | Web search | `web_search` |
| "What's the best practice?" | Web + official docs | `web_search` |
| "Is there a library for X?" | Web + package repos | `web_search` |
| "What are common pitfalls?" | Web + Stack Overflow | `web_search` |

### 📖 **Understanding Context**
| Question | Best Source | Tools* |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| "What does this API do?" | Official documentation | `web_search` for docs |
| "What version is compatible?" | Package docs + changelogs | `web_search`, `read_file` |
| "How has this evolved?" | Git history | `git log`, `git diff` |

*Tool names vary by agent — use equivalent available tools

## Tool Abstraction Guide

Different agents have different tool names. Use what's available:

| Capability | Claude Code | Codex | Generic |
|------------|-------------|-------|---------|
| Read files | `read_file` | `view_file` | file reading tool |
| Search code | `grep`, `codebase_search` | `search` | code search tool |
| Web search | `web_search` | `search_web` | internet search tool |
| Run commands | `run_terminal_cmd` | `shell` | terminal/shell tool |
| Git operations | terminal + git | terminal + git | git via terminal |

**Rule:** Use the tool that achieves the goal, regardless of its name.

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: IDENTIFY WHAT YOU NEED
Clarify the knowledge gap:
- What exactly do I need to know?
- Is this about existing code or new solutions?
- Do I need history/context or just current state?

### Step 2: SELECT SOURCES
Choose appropriate sources based on need:

```
Need to understand existing code?
  → Read code + git history + comments

Need to find a solution approach?
  → Web search + best practices + similar projects

Need to debug something?
  → Logs + git blame + error searches

Need to integrate with external system?
  → Official docs + web search + examples
```

### Step 3: GATHER FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES
Minimum 3 sources for important facts:
- Primary source (code, official docs)
- Secondary source (explanations, tutorials)
- Validation source (tests, examples, community)

### Step 4: CROSS-VALIDATE
Check for consistency:
- Do sources agree?
- Are there contradictions?
- Which source is most authoritative?

### Step 5: SYNTHESIZE
Combine findings into verified knowledge:
- Core facts (verified)
- Context (understood)
- Confidence level (quantified)

## Git History: Your Hidden Knowledge Source

Git history is often overlooked but invaluable:

### When to Use Git
| Situation | Git Command | What You Learn |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| "Why is this code weird?" | `git blame <file>` | Who wrote it and when |
| "What was the intent?" | `git log -p <file>` | Changes over time |
| "When did this break?" | `git bisect` | Which commit caused issue |
| "What changed recently?" | `git log --since="1 week"` | Recent modifications |
| "How did this function evolve?" | `git log -p -S "function_name"` | History of specific code |

### Git Evidence Patterns
```bash
# Who wrote this line and why?
git blame path/to/file.js

# What changed in this file and why?
git log -p --follow path/to/file.js

# Find when a specific line was added
git log -S "specific code" --oneline

# What happened around a date?
git log --since="2024-01-01" --until="2024-02-01"
```

## Web Search: Your External Brain

Web search is essential for:
- Best practices and patterns
- How others solved similar problems
- Library/API documentation
- Error message solutions
- Community knowledge

### Effective Web Search Patterns
```
"How to [specific task] in [language/framework]"
"[error message] solution"
"[library name] best practices"
"[problem] vs [alternative] comparison"
"[technology] production tips"
```

## Output Format

When using Research-Deep 150:

```
🔬 **Research-Deep 150 Complete**

**Question:** [What we needed to know]

**🏠 Internal Research:**
- 📁 Code: [what we found in codebase]
- 📜 Git: [what history revealed]
- 📋 Context: [relevant project facts]

**🌍 External Research:**
- 🌐 Web: [what we found online]
- 📖 Docs: [official documentation]
- 💡 Best Practices: [established patterns]

**Synthesis:**
[Combined understanding from BOTH worlds]

**Recommendation:** [What to do based on research]

**Confidence:** [X]%
**Sources agree:** [Yes/Partial/No]
**Gaps:** [What we still don't know]
```

## Evidence Quality Levels

| Level | Sources | Confidence |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Strong** | 3+ agreeing sources, primary data | 90-100% |
| **Good** | 2-3 sources, mostly agree | 75-89% |
| **Moderate** | 1-2 sources, some assumptions | 50-74% |
| **Weak** | Single source or contradictions | <50% |

## Operational Rules

1. **NEVER SINGLE SOURCE:** Important facts need 3+ sources
2. **USE ALL AVAILABLE:** Code, git, web, docs — use what's relevant
3. **CONTEXT MATTERS:** Choose sources based on what you need to know
4. **GIT IS GOLD:** History often explains the "why"
5. **WEB FOR PATTERNS:** Others have solved your problem before
6. **CROSS-VALIDATE:** Sources should agree or explain why not
7. **QUANTIFY CONFIDENCE:** State how sure you are and why

## Examples

### ❌ Without Research-Deep
```
Question: "Which date library should we use?"
AI: "Use moment.js, it's popular" (outdated advice)
Result: Chose deprecated library, had to migrate later
```

### ✅ With Research-Deep 150
```
Question: "Which date library should we use?"

🔬 Research-Deep 150:

🏠 Internal Research:
- 📁 Code: Currently using native Date, some formatting issues
- 📋 Context: Need timezone support, bundle size matters
- 📜 Git: Previous attempt with moment.js reverted (too heavy)

🌍 External Research:
- 🌐 Web: "best javascript date library 2024"
- 📖 Docs: Compared date-fns, dayjs, luxon
- 💡 Best Practices: moment.js deprecated, modern alternatives exist

Synthesis:
- moment.js is deprecated (external confirms)
- We tried it before, too heavy (internal confirms)
- date-fns: modular, tree-shakeable, good for bundle size
- dayjs: moment-like API, small size
- luxon: best for complex timezone work

Recommendation: dayjs for simple needs (2KB), date-fns for complex (modular)

Confidence: 92%
```

### ✅ Legal Question Example
```
Question: "Can we use this image in our product?"

🔬 Research-Deep 150:

🏠 Internal Research:
- 📁 Found image in /assets/hero.jpg
- 📜 Git: Added 2 years ago, no license info in commit
- 📋 Context: Used on marketing page

🌍 External Research:
- 🌐 Reverse image search: Found on Unsplash
- 📖 Unsplash license: Free for commercial use, no attribution required
- 💡 Best Practice: Still good to keep license record

Recommendation: Safe to use. Document source in assets README.

Confidence: 95%
```

## Failure Modes & Recovery

| Failure | Detection | Recovery |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Internal only** | No external perspective | Add web search, docs |
| **External only** | Ignoring project context | Check code, git, configs |
| **Guessing** | No sources cited | Stop, research properly |
| **Outdated info** | Old articles, deprecated advice | Check dates, find current sources |
| **One world bias** | Only looking at one side | Deliberately check the other world |
