# Field Playbooks Skill

## When to Use
- Empowering regional teams to run repeatable executive dinners, workshops, and roadshows.
- Coordinating co-marketed partner events with shared responsibilities.
- Standardizing follow-up motions and reporting across territories.

## Framework
1. **Persona & Account Targeting** – templates for TAM pulls, ABM lists, partner account splits.
2. **Invite Journeys** – SDR scripts, marketing automation paths, reminder cadence.
3. **Experience Templates** – agendas, discussion guides, demo flows, partner presentations.
4. **Onsite Toolkit** – staffing plan, check-in scripts, gifting matrix, signage guidelines.
5. **Follow-up Motions** – touch cadences for attendees/no-shows, partner summaries, pipeline logging.

## Templates
- Field event brief (objectives, attendees, partners, offers).
- Invite + reminder copy bank.
- Follow-up matrix (persona x action x owner x SLA).

## Tips
- Localize messaging and menu/venue choices per region.
- Track partner sourced/influenced pipeline separately.
- Run quarterly retros with regional leaders to share best practices.
