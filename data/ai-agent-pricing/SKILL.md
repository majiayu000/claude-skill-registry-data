## Proposal Generator

### Step 1: Discovery Questions

Ask the client:
1. **Pain**: What manual task takes most time?
2. **Cost**: How many hours/week? What's the hourly cost?
3. **Impact**: What happens when it's not done?
4. **Timeline**: When do you need this solved?
5. **Budget**: What would you pay to make this go away?

### Step 2: Calculate Value

```
Hours saved/month: [X]
Fully-loaded cost/hour: $[Y] (salary + overhead)
Monthly value created: X × Y = $[Z]
Annual value: Z × 12 = $[A]

Your price target: 10-25% of annual value
```

### Step 3: Select Pricing Model

| Model | Best For | Structure |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Monthly Retainer** | Predictable, ongoing | $X/mo flat fee |
| **Usage-Based** | Variable workloads | Base + per-task |
| **Value Share** | High-impact, trusted | % of savings |
| **Project** | One-time builds | Fixed price |

### Step 4: Build The Proposal

Use this structure:

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchor High
Show the expensive option first. Makes mid-tier feel reasonable.

### Show Value, Not Cost
"This automation saves you $4,000/mo" not "This costs $500/mo"

### Use Odd Numbers
$297 feels researched. $300 feels rounded/arbitrary.

### Bundle Everything
"Includes setup, training, and 30-day support" > listing each

### Create Urgency
"Price valid for 7 days" or "Next 3 clients get..."

### Offer Annual
20% discount for annual = better cash flow, lower churn

## Common Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | "Let's look at what it costs you NOT to do this..." |
| "Need to think" | "Of course. What specifically would you need to know?" |
| "Can't decide alone" | "Let's set up a call with [stakeholder] together" |
| "Build in-house" | "That's months + $X in salary. We're live in 2 weeks" |
| "Cheaper competitor" | "What's missing from their solution?" |
