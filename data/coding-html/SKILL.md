# HTML coding standards

## Syntax & Style
Spacing: Keep vertical spacing compact (no excessive blank lines).
Readability: Prioritize readable code over "clever" one-liners.

## CSS
**In-line css**: Prefer use of classes from .css files to in-line css, unless explicitely justified.

## JS
**In-line js**: Prefer including from functions in .js files to in-line js, unless explicitly justified.

## Comments
**Preserve comments**: Do NOT delete existing, still relevant comments.

## Logic & Operations
**File Collisions**: If a file exists, append _[timestamp] to the new filename.
**Simplicity**: Choose the simplest working solution.
