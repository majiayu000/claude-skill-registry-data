# Marketing Content Guidelines

Structured framework for creating effective social media content for MYCURE healthcare products across all platforms.

## When This Skill Activates

- Writing social media posts (Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook)
- Creating marketing campaigns or announcements
- Drafting product updates or feature releases
- Building community engagement content
- Developing educational healthcare content
- Planning content calendars

---

## The 4-Part Post Framework

**Every social media post MUST include:**

1. **Hook** (10-15 words) - Grab attention in <3 seconds
2. **Body** (contextual content) - Deliver value
3. **CTA** (call to action) - Direct next step
4. **Hashtags** (platform-specific count) - Improve discoverability

---

## Part 1: Hook (10-15 Words)

### Purpose
- Visible without "see more" click (~125 characters for Instagram)
- Grab attention immediately
- Promise value or create curiosity
- Relate to body content

### Hook Types

**Question Hook:**
```
"Ever feel like patient registration takes forever?"
"What if your clinic could reduce wait times by 40%?"
"How much time does your staff spend on manual data entry?"
```
Use for: Problem posts, educational content, engagement

**Statistic Hook:**
```
"73% of Philippine clinics still use paper records."
"Manual registration takes 15 minutes. With MYCURE, it takes 5."
"Healthcare professionals spend 40% of their time on paperwork."
```
Use for: Problem posts, industry insights, product value

**Bold Statement Hook:**
```
"Patient registration doesn't have to take 15 minutes."
"Your clinic deserves better than paper records."
"Paperwork shouldn't come between you and your patients."
```
Use for: Product value, industry leadership, motivation

**Story Hook:**
```
"Meet Dr. Santos. She used to spend 2 hours daily on admin work."
"Last year, Clinic A was drowning in paper. Today, they're fully digital."
```
Use for: Community building, testimonials, case studies

### Hook Best Practices

**DO:**
- Keep under 125 characters (Instagram threshold)
- Use specific numbers (73%, 15 minutes, 5 patients)
- Ask questions your audience actually asks
- Test hooks with team before publishing

**DON'T:**
- Use clickbait or misleading hooks
- Promise value you don't deliver
- Use overly technical jargon
- Write hooks requiring context

## Part 2: Body (Contextual Content)

### Body Structure Options

#### Option 1: Problem → Solution

```
[Hook about problem]

[Expand on problem with details/data]

[Introduce MYCURE as solution]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
```
Manual patient registration takes 15 minutes per patient. 📋

That's 12.5 hours per week for a clinic seeing 50 patients daily.
Time that could be spent on patient care.

MYCURE's Registration module changes this. ⚡

With auto-fill, real-time validation, and cross-module sync,
registration now takes just 5 minutes. That's 8.3 hours saved per week.

```

#### Option 3: Educational

```
[Hook with educational promise]

[Teach concept or best practice]

[Position MYCURE as tool to implement]
