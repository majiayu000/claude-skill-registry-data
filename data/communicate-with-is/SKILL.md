## Who is the Is?

Is types are warm, cheerful, and light-hearted people who combine social enthusiasm with a supportive, steady nature. They genuinely care about others' well-being and naturally make people feel valued and appreciated. What matters most to them is relationships, harmony, and making a positive impact on the people around them. Their communication style is feeling-based and people-focused, and they create welcoming atmospheres wherever they go.

## Do's

- Start with personal check-ins and warm greetings before diving into business.
- Express genuine appreciation for their help and contributions regularly.
- Communicate with warmth, authenticity, and a personal touch.
- Create collaborative, supportive environments where they feel safe to contribute.
- Acknowledge their impact on team morale and culture -- it matters to them.
- Frame improvements as growth opportunities, not criticisms.
- Include context about how their work impacts real people.
- End conversations and emails with positive notes or words of encouragement.

## Don'ts

- Don't be cold, transactional, or purely task-focused in your communication.
- Don't deliver blunt criticism without warmth or context.
- Don't put them in highly competitive or confrontational situations unnecessarily.
- Don't ignore their contributions or take their support for granted.
- Don't force them to work in isolation without social interaction.

- Don't publicly criticize them -- address concerns privately.
- Don't dismiss the relational dimension of decisions they care about.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Start with personal check-ins and warm greetings. Allow time for relationship building before diving into agendas. Encourage their input and acknowledge their contributions. Keep the atmosphere positive and collaborative -- they'll contribute their best thinking when they feel safe and valued.

### Email
Use a warm, friendly tone with personal touches. Express appreciation for their help and contributions. Include context about how their work impacts others -- this is what motivates them. End with positive notes or words of encouragement.

### Giving Feedback
Lead with genuine appreciation and specific positives. Frame improvements as growth opportunities rather than criticisms. Be gentle but honest -- they value authenticity above all. Express confidence in their ability to improve, and they'll take the feedback to heart.

### Resolving Conflict
Approach privately with care and sensitivity. Focus on the issue, not personal criticism. Acknowledge their feelings and perspective before jumping to solutions. Work toward outcomes that preserve relationships while still addressing the concern. They need to feel the relationship is safe before they can engage with the problem.
