# Podcast Blog Post Creator

## Purpose

Transform podcast episodes into SEO-optimized blog posts that capture the energy and authenticity of the conversation in written form. The output is a narrative-driven explainer that introduces the guest, highlights their key insight, and provides actionable value to readers - all in a natural, conversational voice.

**Core Philosophy**: Good writing is a transfer of energy. The blog post should feel like the host is sitting across from you, telling you about a conversation they had that changed how they think about something important.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you:
- Have a polished podcast transcript and want to repurpose it as written content
- Want to drive SEO traffic from blog readers to the full podcast episode
- Need to create a permanent, searchable record of the episode's key insight
- Want to build guest relationships by making them look good in writing
- Are looking to establish expertise in a specific topic area through long-form content

**Do NOT use for:**
- Quick social media captions (use social-content-creation skill instead)
- Episode summaries (this goes deeper than summary)
- Transcripts (this is narrative, not transcript)

## Key Principles

### The Angle
Your blog post focuses on **one primary insight or paradox from the episode**, not everything the guest discussed. This is crucial. A guest might touch on 5-7 big ideas. You pick one and go deep.

**How to identify the angle:**
- What's the most counterintuitive idea?
- What's the most helpful for your core audience?
- What's a surprising realization that contradicts conventional wisdom?
- What's the guest's own lived example that proves the point?

### The Voice
Write in a **conversational, authentic voice**: warm, curious, and genuine. The host is the guide inviting the reader into a conversation that happened.

**Tone markers:**
- Uses "I" and "we" naturally
- Asks genuine questions (not rhetorical)
- Tells stories and uses metaphors
- Focuses on the human element, not abstractions
- Doesn't preach or lecture

If you have a brand identity profile from brand-identity-wizard, use those voice guidelines.

### The SEO Strategy
Headers should use **audience-specific keywords** that your readers actually search for. Not generic concepts - specific challenges your audience faces.

**Examples of strong header keywords:**
- "Why [audience] should rethink [common practice]"
- "How [unexpected approach] builds [desired outcome]"
- "When [good intention] backfires: [specific situation]"
- "Stop forcing [common mistake]"

Not:
- "Understanding motivation"
- "The importance of boredom"
- "External vs. internal motivation"

### The Structure

**Opening (200-250 words)**
- Hook with a relatable scenario or question
- **Introduce the guest early and naturally** with:
  - Their credentials/expertise (but only what's relevant)
  - Their personal connection to the topic
  - Why they're credible to speak on this
- Don't bury who they are - weave it into the narrative
- End the opening with their core insight (usually a verbatim quote)

**Body (700-800 words)**
- **Section 1**: Explore the core insight with depth
  - Use at least one verbatim quote that cannot be paraphrased
  - Explain why this matters
  - Provide a compelling example (ideally the guest's own story)

- **Section 2**: The paradox or problem
  - What's counterintuitive here?
  - Why do most people get this wrong?
  - What's the hidden cost of conventional wisdom?
  - Use vivid metaphors (the guest likely provided these)

- **Section 3**: The practical alternative
  - What should readers do instead?
  - Concrete, actionable guidance
  - Not overly prescriptive (avoid "you must...")
  - Frame as "here's what this might look like"

- **Section 4**: The wider perspective
  - Why does this matter beyond the immediate problem?
  - What does the long view show us?
  - How does this reshape how we think about [topic]?

**Closing (100-150 words)**
- Guest bio and links (3-4 key resources max)
- Link to full podcast episode
- Optional: brief reflection on what the guest's work means for readers

### Quote Usage

**Verbatim quotes (use sparingly, with impact):**
- The core insight (usually near the top)
- Quotes that are vivid, specific, or surprising
- Quotes the reader couldn't easily paraphrase
- Usually 3-5 direct quotes per post

**Paraphrased content (most of the post):**
- Supporting examples
- Context and explanation
- Data or research references
- Guest's own reasoning (reframed in your voice)

**The ratio:** Roughly 20% direct quotes, 80% paraphrased and contextualized.

### Length
- **Target: ~1,000 words**
- Not a summary (too short)
- Not a deep-dive research piece (too long)
- Long enough to explore the idea fully
- Short enough to read in one sitting

### Guest Representation
Your job is to make the guest look good.

**Do:**
- Highlight their expertise and credibility
- Share their best thinking
- Use their most compelling examples
- Link to their work (website, podcast, book, etc.)
- Include a substantive bio at the end

**Don't:**
- Misrepresent their ideas
- Cherry-pick quotes out of context
- Make them sound like something they're not
- Oversimplify nuanced thinking

## The 3-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (15-20 minutes)

**Step 1: Choose your angle**
- Read through the polished transcript
- Identify 3-5 potential angles
- Pick the one that:
  - Is most surprising/counterintuitive
  - Resonates most with your audience
  - Is supported by a guest story or example
  - Could be searched for in Google

**Step 2: Identify claims that need hyperlinks**
- As you read the transcript, flag any claims about:
  - Research-backed assertions
  - Statistics or data points
  - Scientific or academic concepts
  - Health/psychological benefits
- These will become opportunities to link to credible sources

**Step 3: Research hyperlink sources (5-10 minutes)**
- For each flagged claim, search for peer-reviewed sources:
  - NIH/PubMed Central (pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
  - Academic journals
  - University research centers
  - Reputable organizations
- Prioritize sources with:
  - DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers)
  - Peer-review credentials
  - Author expertise
  - Accessible language
  - Avoid commercial/sales-focused sites
- Create a simple reference list: [Claim] -> [URL] -> [Brief credibility note]

**Step 4: Mine the transcript for quotes**
- Search for the verbatim quotes that are:
  - Vivid or metaphorical
  - Surprising
  - Concise enough to stand alone
  - Not easily paraphrased
- Copy these with timestamps for reference
- Also note 3-4 longer passages you'll paraphrase

**Step 5: Outline the narrative arc**
- What's the opening hook?
- What's the core insight?
- What's the paradox/problem?
- What's the practical alternative?
- What's the wider perspective?
- Where will the hyperlinked claims fit naturally?

### Phase 2: Writing (35-45 minutes)

**Step 1: Write the opening**
- Start with a relatable scenario (not a question unless it's genuine)
- Weave in guest introduction naturally (not a separate paragraph)
- End with or lead to their core insight

**Step 2: Write the body in sections**
- Each section has one clear purpose
- Use headers with SEO keywords relevant to your audience
- Aim for 150-200 words per section
- Include at least one strong quote per section

**Step 3: Integrate hyperlinks strategically**
- As you write, embed hyperlinks in sentences where they flow naturally
- Link on key claims you researched in Phase 1:
  - First mention of claim gets the hyperlink
  - Integrate link into existing text
  - Use descriptive anchor text (avoid "click here")

**Example of good hyperlink integration:**
- Bad: "Music affects the brain. [Learn more here](URL)"
- Good: "[Research from Harvard Medical School](URL) shows that music activates the entire brain..."

**Step 4: Write the closing**
- Reflect on the wider implications
- Link to guest resources
- Link to full podcast episode

**Step 5: Review for voice**
- Does it sound conversational?
- Are there places where it sounds preachy or abstract?
- Have you used "I" and "we" naturally?
- Do hyperlinks feel natural or forced?

### Phase 3: Optimization (10-15 minutes)

**Step 1: Check headers for SEO**
- Are they specific to your audience's challenges?
- Would someone searching for this topic find them compelling?
- Do they promise value or insight?

**Step 2: Verify quote accuracy**
- All verbatim quotes match the transcript exactly
- All quotes are properly contextualized
- No quotes are misleading when taken alone

**Step 3: Verify hyperlinks for credibility and functionality**
- All hyperlinks are to credible, peer-reviewed sources
- Each link has a clear credibility marker
- Test each hyperlink to ensure it's active
- Anchor text is descriptive and contextual
- Hyperlinks integrate naturally
- No more than 1-2 hyperlinks per major claim

**Step 4: Check guest representation**
- Is the bio substantive and credible?
- Are all links working and current?
- Would the guest be happy with how they're represented?

**Step 5: Word count check**
- Target: ~1,000 words
- Count body content only (not header, not bio)
- Ensure content isn't padded with unnecessary explanation

## Advanced Techniques

### The Narrative Thread
Instead of jumping between ideas, weave them together through the guest's personal story. Use their lived experience as the spine that holds the whole piece together.

**Good:** [Guest] noticed [observation], decided to [action], and [result]. This observation led them to...

**Bad:** [Topic] is important. [Related idea] is also important. [Concept] is the problem. Here's a story.

### The Metaphor Method
Guests often provide perfect metaphors that make abstract ideas concrete. Identify these and use them repeatedly.

**How it works:**
- Guest provides metaphor
- You establish it in the body
- You return to it in closing
- It becomes a memorable anchor for the reader

### The Practical Path
When offering alternatives, give readers something they can actually do tomorrow, not philosophical ideals.

**Good:** "Instead of [common approach], you might [specific alternative]. Try [concrete action]. Notice [observable outcome]."

**Bad:** "Readers should respect [abstract concept] and prioritize [vague value]."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### The Summary Trap
The blog post is NOT a summary of the episode. It's a deep dive into one insight with narrative energy.

**Problem:** "[Guest] also discussed [topic A], and they talked about [topic B], and they mentioned [topic C], and..."

**Solution:** Pick ONE angle. Go deep. Leave readers wanting to hear the full episode.

### The Expert Voice
Writing about the guest's ideas doesn't mean adopting their academic voice. Stay in your conversational voice throughout.

**Problem:** "The phenomenology of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation suggests that external standards create a bifurcation in..."

**Solution:** "The moment you add a [external pressure] to something [your audience] loves, something shifts. They're no longer [doing it] for themselves."

### The Generic Header
SEO-optimized headers should be specific to your audience, not generic concepts.

**Problem:** "Understanding Motivation" or "The Importance of Boredom"

**Solution:** "Why [Audience] Should Rethink How They [Specific Action]"

### The Buried Guest
Introduce who the guest is early and naturally. Don't make it a separate section. Don't bury it until the end.

**Problem:** Spending 400 words on the topic before saying who's talking about it.

**Solution:** "[Guest Name] has watched this happen dozens of times. They're a [credentials] and [relevant experience]..."
