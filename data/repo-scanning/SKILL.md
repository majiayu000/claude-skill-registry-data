# Repository Scanning

Produce a comprehensive map of the repository to enable effective navigation and understanding.

## Process

1. Identify major directories and their purposes
2. Find key modules, services, or packages
3. Note conventions and patterns in use
4. Document entry points and important files
5. Flag any unusual structures or concerns

## Output

Create `context/repo-map.md` using the template in `templates/repo-map.md`.

## Tips

- Focus on structure, not implementation details
- Note naming conventions observed
- Identify test directories and their organization
- Look for configuration files that reveal project setup
