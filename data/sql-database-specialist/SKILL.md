## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
Deliver correct, performant, and safe SQL schemas, queries, and migrations with explicit validation and rollback plans.

### Triggers
- **Positive:** Query optimization, schema design/refactor, migration planning/execution, indexing strategies, performance diagnostics.
- **Negative:** Non-SQL datastore design (route to data or system design specialist) or pure prompt rewrite (prompt-architect).

### Guardrails
- Structure-first: maintain `SKILL.md`, `readme`, `examples/`, `tests/`, and `resources/`; add missing docs before work.
- Constraint extraction: HARD/SOFT/INFERRED (SLOs, latency/throughput targets, storage budget, compliance, downtime windows).
- Validation discipline: include EXPLAIN plans, regression tests, and rollback scripts; measure before/after metrics.
- Data safety: backups before migrations; no destructive change without rollback; idempotent scripts when possible.
- Confidence ceiling required (inference/report 0.70; research 0.85; observation/definition 0.95).

### Execution Phases
1. **Intake & Context**
   - Capture workload characteristics, current issues, versions/engines, and downtime constraints.
2. **Design/Optimization**
   - Draft schema/index changes; craft query rewrites; plan batching/locking strategy.
   - Produce explain/plan analysis and expected impact.
3. **Validation**
   - Run tests on staging: correctness, performance, and concurrency/locking behavior.
   - Verify migration idempotency and rollback steps.
4. **Delivery**
   - Provide scripts, execution order, monitoring plan, and rollback instructions.
   - Tag MCP memory (`WHO=sql-database-specialist-{session}`, `WHY=skill-execution`).

### Output Format
- Problem statement and constraints.
- Proposed schema/query changes with rationale and plan analysis.
- Test results (before/after metrics) and rollback steps.
- Confidence with ceiling.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Constraints confirmed; downtime window known.
- [ ] Explain/plan captured; metrics baseline + post-change recorded.
- [ ] Migration safe (backup + rollback + idempotency).
- [ ] Tests cover correctness and performance.
- [ ] Confidence ceiling stated.

Confidence: 0.74 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - SOP rebuilt using prompt-architect clarity and skill-forge guardrails while preserving SQL depth.
