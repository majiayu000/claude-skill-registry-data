## What I do
- Break down PRD requirements into actionable agile work items
- Create hierarchical structure: Initiatives → Epics → Features → User Stories
- Generate detailed acceptance criteria for each user story
- Provide priority rankings and complexity estimates
- Create sprint-ready backlog items with team assignment recommendations

## When to use me
Use when you need to:
- Transform PRD requirements into development-ready user stories
- Structure complex projects into manageable work items
- Prepare sprint backlogs from high-level requirements
- Create feature breakdowns for release planning
- Establish clear acceptance criteria for QA and testing

## How I work
1. **Requirements Analysis** - Parse PRD content and identify core functionality
2. **Hierarchy Creation** - Organize work into initiatives, epics, features, and stories
3. **Story Formulation** - Write user stories following "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format
4. **Acceptance Criteria** - Define clear, testable conditions for story completion
5. **Priority Assessment** - Rank work items based on business value and dependencies
6. **Complexity Estimation** - Provide story point estimates and effort assessment
7. **Dependency Mapping** - Identify and document inter-story dependencies
8. **Team Assignment** - Recommend team assignments based on skill requirements

## What I need
- Completed PRD with functional requirements
- Information about team size and skill composition
- Sprint duration or release timeline preferences
- Any technical constraints or platform limitations
- Priority framework (MoSCoW, Value vs Effort, etc.)

## What I produce
A comprehensive feature breakdown containing:
- **Initiative Overview** - High-level business objectives and themes
- **Epic Definitions** - Large work items with clear business value
- **Feature Specifications** - Detailed functionality descriptions
- **User Stories** - Complete with acceptance criteria and definition of done
- **Priority Matrix** - Ranked by business value, effort, and risk
- **Story Point Estimates** - Relative complexity assessments
- **Dependency Map** - Visual representation of work item relationships
- **Sprint Recommendations** - Suggested sprint groupings and sequencing
- **Team Assignment Guide** - Skills needed and team composition advice
- **Release Planning** - How features map to releases and milestones

## Usage Example
```
"Create user stories and epics from this e-commerce platform PRD for a 3-person development team"
```

This will generate a complete, sprint-ready backlog with clear acceptance criteria and priority rankings.
