# Communication Tracker Skill

## When to use this Skill

Activate when the user:
- Mentions importing or tracking emails, messages, or communications
- Uses keywords: "email", "message", "communication", "screenshot", "chat log", "track", "import"
- Provides image files (screenshots of emails/chats)
- Wants to record external communication updates
- Mentions "import communication", "track message", "record email"
- References specific communication sources (Slack, Teams, Gmail, etc.)
- Asks to add timeline entries from external sources
- Pastes email content or chat logs

## Tools Available

This Skill uses the following tools for content extraction:
- **`mu`**: Email indexer for reading email content from local maildir
- **Claude Vision**: Direct image reading for screenshots
- **`markitdown`**: Convert various file formats to markdown (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.)

## Workflow

### Phase 0: First-Time Configuration (One-Time Setup)

**Objective**: Configure communication tracking preferences on first use.

**Trigger**: This phase activates only if `communications/config.yaml` does not exist.

**Steps**:

1. **Detect first-time use**:
   ```bash
   ls communications/config.yaml
   ```
   If file doesn't exist → Proceed with configuration Q&A.

2. **Ask configuration questions** using AskUserQuestion tool:

   **Question 1: Timeline Tracking**:
   ```
   Timeline Configuration

   Should I create a dedicated timeline tracking file?
   This helps maintain chronological order of all communications.

   Options:
   1. Yes, create timeline.yaml (structured, machine-readable)
   2. Yes, create timeline.md (human-readable markdown)
   3. Yes, create both formats (Recommended)
   4. No, embed timeline in individual files only
   ```

   **Question 2: Original Data Backup**:
   ```
   Original Data Backup

   Should I backup original source data?
   This preserves unprocessed content for reference.

   Options:
   1. Yes, always backup originals in raw/ subdirectory (Recommended)
   2. Yes, only for images/attachments
   3. No, extract content only (no backup)
   ```

   **Question 3: Default Source Types**:
   ```
   Communication Sources

   What types of communications do you typically track?
   (Select all that apply)

   - Email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
   - Chat (Slack, Teams, Discord)
   - Screenshots (any visual capture)
   - Voice/Meeting transcripts
   - Documents
   ```

   **Question 4: Timestamp Handling**:
   ```
   Timestamp Handling

   How should I handle communications without clear timestamps?

   Options:
   1. Always ask user for the timestamp
   2. Use current time with "[estimated]" marker
   3. Try to infer from content, ask if uncertain (Recommended)
   ```

3. **Generate config.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   # communications/config.yaml
   # Generated by ProjectMaster communication-tracker Skill

   timeline:
     enabled: true
     format: both  # yaml|md|both|none
     file: timeline

   backup:
     enabled: true
     mode: all  # all|attachments|none
     directory: raw/

   sources:
     - email
     - chat
     - screenshot
     - document

   timestamp_handling:
     mode: infer  # ask|estimate|infer
     marker_for_estimated: "[estimated]"

   # Auto-generated
   created: YYYY-MM-DD
   last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

4. **Create directory structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p communications/raw communications/by-source communications/by-date
   ```

5. **Create initial files**:
   - `communications/README.md` - Index of all communications
   - `communications/timeline.yaml` - Machine-readable timeline
   - `communications/timeline.md` - Human-readable timeline

6. **Report configuration complete**:
   ```
   Communication Tracker Configured!

   Structure created:
   communications/
   ├── config.yaml (your preferences)
   ├── README.md (index)
   ├── timeline.yaml (chronological tracking)
   ├── timeline.md (human-readable timeline)
   ├── raw/ (original data backup)
   ├── by-source/ (organized by source type)
   └── by-date/ (organized by date)

   Ready to track communications! Try:
   - "Track this email: [paste content]"
   - "Import screenshot [provide image path]"
   - "Record communication from Slack about [topic]"
   ```

### Phase 1: Context Discovery & Source Detection

**Objective**: Understand project context and identify communication source type.

**Steps**:

1. **Read project RULE.md**:
   ```bash
   ls RULE.md
   Read RULE.md
   ```
   Extract communication tracking preferences if defined.

2. **Read communications/config.yaml**:
   ```bash
   Read communications/config.yaml
   ```
   If not found → Trigger Phase 0 first.

3. **Detect source type from user input**:

   | Input Pattern | Source Type | Detection Method |
   |--------------|-------------|------------------|
   | Image file path (.png, .jpg, .gif) | screenshot | File extension detection |
   | `mu` output or email headers (From:, To:, Date:, Subject:) | email | Header pattern matching |
   | Text with chat format (timestamps + usernames) | chat | Timestamp/username patterns |
   | Markdown/text file | document | File content structure |
   | PDF, DOCX, XLSX | document | File extension + markitdown |
   | User describes source | manual | Ask for clarification |

4. **Route to appropriate extraction workflow**:
   - Source: screenshot → Phase 2A (Image Processing)
   - Source: email → Phase 2B (Email Processing)
   - Source: text/chat → Phase 2C (Text Processing)
   - Source: file → Phase 2D (File Processing)

**Example**:
```
User: "Track this email from the client about project updates"

Detected:
- Source type: email
- Content: [email text provided by user]
- Related: project updates
→ Route to Phase 2B (Email Processing)
```

### Phase 2A: Image Processing (Screenshots)

**Objective**: Extract information from screenshot images.

**Steps**:

1. **Read image using Claude's vision**:
   ```
   Use Read tool with image file path
   Claude will analyze the image content
   ```

2. **Extract structured information**:
   - **Source platform**: (Gmail, Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, LINE, etc.)
   - **Participants**: (sender, recipients, @mentions)
   - **Timestamp**: (look for date/time in image)
   - **Subject/Topic**: (email subject, channel name, etc.)
   - **Key content**: (main message body)
   - **Attachments mentioned**: (if visible)
   - **Thread context**: (is this a reply? part of conversation?)

3. **Handle timestamp extraction**:
   ```
   If timestamp clearly visible in image:
     → Extract and validate format
   If timestamp partially visible or ambiguous:
     → Show extracted timestamp, ask user to confirm
   If no timestamp visible:
     → Check config.yaml timestamp_handling mode
     → If "ask": Ask user for timestamp
     → If "estimate": Use current time with [estimated] marker
     → If "infer": Try to infer from context, ask if uncertain
   ```

4. **Confirm extraction with user**:
   ```
   Screenshot Analysis Complete

   I extracted the following information:

   Source: [Platform - e.g., Gmail]
   From: [Sender]
   To: [Recipients]
   Date: [Timestamp or "Unable to determine - please provide"]
   Subject: [Topic]

   Content Summary:
   [Key points from the communication]

   Is this correct? Any corrections needed?
   [If timestamp missing: "When was this communication from?"]
   ```

5. **Backup original image** (if config.yaml backup.enabled):
   ```bash
   cp [image_path] communications/raw/YYYY-MM-DD_source_filename.png
   ```

### Phase 2B: Email Processing

**Objective**: Extract and structure email content.

**Steps**:

1. **Determine email source**:
   - If user provides raw text → Parse directly
   - If user mentions `mu` → Use mu command to fetch
   - If user provides file path (.eml) → Read file

2. **Use `mu` for email fetching** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   # Search for specific email
   mu find subject:[search term] --format=sexp

   # View specific email
   mu view [message-id]
   ```

3. **Extract email metadata**:
   ```yaml
   from: [sender email and name]
   to: [recipient list]
   cc: [cc list]
   date: [email date from headers]
   subject: [subject line]
   message_id: [unique identifier]
   thread_id: [conversation thread]
   attachments: [list of attachments]
   ```

4. **Extract email body**:
   - Convert HTML to markdown (if HTML email)
   - Preserve formatting and links
   - Extract inline images references

5. **Identify key information**:
   - Action items mentioned
   - Decisions communicated
   - Questions asked
   - Deadlines mentioned
   - People referenced (@mentions, names)

6. **Backup original** (if configured):
   ```bash
   # Save raw email to backup
   mu view [message-id] > communications/raw/YYYY-MM-DD_email_subject-slug.eml
   ```

### Phase 2C: Text/Chat Processing

**Objective**: Process plain text or chat message content.

**Steps**:

1. **Detect chat format**:
   - Slack format: `[timestamp] username: message`
   - Teams format: `username timestamp message`
   - Discord format: `username timestamp message`
   - LINE format: `YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM name message`
   - Generic: timestamps + usernames

2. **Parse conversation**:
   ```yaml
   platform: [detected or ask]
   channel_dm: [if identifiable]
   participants: [list of usernames]
   date_range:
     start: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM
     end: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM
   messages:
     - timestamp: [time]
       sender: [username]
       content: [message]
   ```

3. **Handle multi-message threads**:
   - Group related messages
   - Identify thread starts and replies
   - Extract thread summary

4. **Ask for missing context** if needed:
   ```
   I parsed this chat conversation but need clarification:

   - Platform: [Ask if not detected]
   - Channel/Context: [Ask if not clear]
   - Date: [Ask if timestamps are relative like "yesterday"]
   ```

### Phase 2D: File Processing (markitdown)

**Objective**: Process various file formats using markitdown.

**Steps**:

1. **Identify file type**:
   - PDF documents
   - Word documents (.docx)
   - Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx)
   - Other supported formats

2. **Use markitdown for conversion**:
   ```bash
   markitdown [file_path]
   ```

3. **Extract metadata from converted content**:
   - Document title
   - Author (if available)
   - Creation/modification date
   - Key content sections

4. **Handle conversion errors**:
   - If markitdown fails, report error
   - Suggest alternative approaches
   - Offer to save original file as-is

### Phase 3: Timestamp Validation & Normalization

**Objective**: Ensure all communications have valid, normalized timestamps.

**Steps**:

1. **Normalize timestamp format**:
   - Target format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+TZ` (ISO 8601)
   - Preserve original timezone if available
   - Convert relative times ("yesterday", "2 hours ago") to absolute

2. **Validate timestamp**:
   - Not in the future (unless explicitly stated)
   - Within reasonable range for source type
   - Consistent with thread context

3. **If timestamp uncertain** (based on config.yaml timestamp_handling):
   ```
   Timestamp Clarification Needed

   I couldn't determine an exact timestamp from the content.

   The communication appears to be from approximately:
   [Best guess based on context]

   Please provide the actual date/time, or confirm this estimate:
   - Exact: "2025-12-10 14:30"
   - Approximate: "last Tuesday afternoon"
   - Confirm estimate: "yes, that's correct"
   ```

4. **Store timestamp with confidence level**:
   ```yaml
   timestamp:
     value: 2025-12-10T14:30:00+08:00
     confidence: exact|inferred|estimated
     original_format: "[as found in source]"
   ```

### Phase 4: Content Structuring

**Objective**: Structure extracted content into standardized format.

**Steps**:

1. **Generate communication document**:

   **Filename convention**:
   `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_source_subject-slug.md`

   **Document structure**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   id: comm-{uuid}
   type: email|chat|screenshot|document
   source: [platform/origin]
   timestamp: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+TZ
   timestamp_confidence: exact|inferred|estimated
   participants:
     from: [sender]
     to: [recipients]
   subject: [topic/subject]
   related_sprint: [sprint-number or null]
   related_milestone: [milestone-id or null]
   related_communications: [list of related comm-ids]
   tags: [auto-generated tags]
   backup_file: [path to original if backed up]
   ---

   # [Subject/Topic]

   **Date**: [Human readable timestamp]
   **Source**: [Platform/Origin]
   **From**: [Sender]
   **To**: [Recipients]

   ## Content

   [Extracted/converted content in markdown]

   ## Key Points

   - [Automatically extracted key points]

   - Previous Communication: [link if part of thread]

   ---
   *Tracked by ProjectMaster communication-tracker Skill*
   *Original backup: [path or "not backed up"]*
   ```

2. **Auto-extract key points**:
   - Action items (look for "need to", "please", "todo", etc.)
   - Decisions (look for "decided", "will proceed", "agreed", etc.)
   - Questions (look for "?" or question patterns)
   - Deadlines (look for dates, "by Friday", etc.)

3. **Auto-generate tags**:
   - Based on content analysis
   - Project-specific keywords from RULE.md
   - People mentioned
   - Topics detected

### Phase 5: Timeline Integration

**Objective**: Add communication to project timeline.

**Steps**:

1. **Read current timeline files**:
   ```bash
   Read communications/timeline.yaml
   Read communications/timeline.md
   ```

2. **Add entry to timeline.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   timeline:
     - id: comm-{uuid}
       timestamp: 2025-12-10T14:30:00+08:00
       timestamp_confidence: exact
       type: email
       source: Gmail
       subject: "Project Update from Client"
       from: client@example.com
       summary: "Client approved Phase 2 designs with minor revisions"
       file: communications/by-date/2025-12/2025-12-10_14-30_email_project-update.md
       related:
         sprint: sprint-05
         milestone: beta-release
         thread: comm-previous-id
       tags: [client, approval, design]
       key_points:
         - "Design approved with 3 minor revisions"
         - "Deadline: Dec 15 for revisions"
       action_items:
         - "Implement revision 1: color scheme update"
         - "Implement revision 2: font size adjustment"
   ```

3. **Add entry to timeline.md** (human-readable):
   ```markdown
   ## 2025-12-10

   ### 14:30 - Email from Client

   **Subject**: Project Update from Client
   **From**: client@example.com
   **Summary**: Client approved Phase 2 designs with minor revisions
   **File**: [View full communication](by-date/2025-12/2025-12-10_14-30_email_project-update.md)
   **Related**: Sprint 5, Beta Release Milestone
   ```

4. **Maintain chronological order**:
   - Insert new entry in correct position (sorted by timestamp)
   - Update surrounding entries if needed for context

5. **Cross-reference with existing communications**:
   - If part of email thread → Link to previous
   - If same topic as recent → Note relationship
   - If references project artifacts → Add links

### Phase 6: Save and Organize

**Objective**: Save communication to appropriate locations.

**Steps**:

1. **Determine file locations**:
   - Primary: `communications/by-date/YYYY-MM/filename.md`
   - Index reference: `communications/by-source/{source}/README.md`
   - Backup: `communications/raw/` (if configured)

2. **Create directory structure if needed**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p communications/by-date/2025-12
   mkdir -p communications/by-source/email
   ```

3. **Save communication document**:
   ```bash
   Write communications/by-date/2025-12/2025-12-10_14-30_email_project-update.md
   ```

4. **Update by-source index**:
   Add to `communications/by-source/email/README.md`

5. **Verify save successful**:
   ```bash
   ls -la communications/by-date/2025-12/2025-12-10_14-30_email_project-update.md
   ```

### Phase 7: Governance Update

**Objective**: Update README.md indexes and project documentation.

**Steps**:

1. **Update communications/README.md**:
   ```markdown
   ## Recent Communications

   ### December 2025

   | Date | Type | Subject | From | File |
   |------|------|---------|------|------|
   | 2025-12-10 14:30 | Email | Project Update from Client | client@example.com | [View](by-date/2025-12/2025-12-10_14-30_email_project-update.md) |

   [Previous entries...]

   ---
   Last updated: 2025-12-10
   ```

2. **Update project root README.md**:
   Add to Recent Activity:
   ```markdown
   ## Recent Activity

   - 2025-12-10: Communication tracked - Client approval email for Phase 2
   ```

3. **Update related artifacts** (if applicable):
   - If communication mentions sprint → Update sprint document references
   - If communication contains decision → Create/update decision record
   - If communication has action items → Optionally create tasks

4. **Execute custom workflows from RULE.md**:
   Read and execute any project-specific workflows for communications.

### Phase 8: Report

**Objective**: Confirm completion and provide summary.

**Report format**:

```

Tips:
- View timeline: "Show communication timeline"
- Search communications: "Find communications about [topic]"
- Track another: "Track this email: [content]"
```

## Special Cases

### Case 1: Batch Import

If user provides multiple communications at once:

```
User: "Import all these emails about the project"
[Multiple email contents or file paths]
```

**Process**:
1. Identify all items (emails/messages/files)
2. Process each individually (Phase 2-5)
3. Maintain thread relationships
4. Update timeline once with all entries
5. Report batch summary:
   ```
   Batch Import Complete!

   Imported 5 communications:
   - 3 emails (Dec 5, Dec 7, Dec 10)
   - 2 chat threads (Dec 6, Dec 9)

   Timeline updated with 5 new entries
   Thread relationships established

   [List of created files]
   ```

### Case 2: Thread/Conversation Tracking

If communication is part of ongoing thread:

**Process**:
1. Detect thread indicators (Re:, Fwd:, reply chains)
2. Search existing communications for thread
3. If found: Link as continuation
4. If not found: Ask if should create new thread
5. Update thread visualization in timeline:

```markdown
## Email Thread: Project Budget Discussion
├── 2025-12-05 09:00: Initial proposal [From: PM]
├── 2025-12-06 14:30: Questions from finance [From: CFO]
├── 2025-12-08 10:15: Revised proposal [From: PM]
└── 2025-12-10 16:00: Approval [From: CFO] ← NEW
```

### Case 3: Mixed Media Communication

If communication contains multiple media types:

```
User: "Track this email with the attached screenshot"
```

**Process**:
1. Process email content (Phase 2B)
2. Process attachment (Phase 2A for screenshot)
3. Create linked documents:
   - Main: email document
   - Attachment: screenshot analysis
4. Cross-reference in both documents
5. Single timeline entry with attachments noted

### Case 4: Urgent/Priority Communication

If communication marked as urgent or contains deadlines:

**Process**:
1. Detect urgency markers ("URGENT", "ASAP", deadline dates)
2. Add priority tag
3. Highlight in timeline with marker
4. Suggest linking to milestone/sprint if deadline related
5. Optionally: Create action item or reminder

**Timeline entry**:
```markdown
- [URGENT] [2025-12-10 14:30] Server maintenance window - Deadline Dec 12
```

### Case 5: Failed Timestamp Extraction

If cannot determine timestamp even after inferring:

**Process**:
1. Ask user directly for timestamp
2. If user doesn't know:
   - Offer to use "approximate" with date only
   - Offer to use current time with [estimated] marker
   - Let user specify "sometime in [week/month]"
3. Store with lowest confidence level
4. Mark in timeline as [Approximate Date]

### Case 6: Non-Project Communication

If user tracks communication not related to current project:

**Process**:
1. Detect if content relates to different project
2. Ask user to confirm:
   ```
   This communication appears to be about [other topic].
   Should I:
   1. Track it in this project anyway
   2. Track it to a different project (specify)
   3. Store it in a general communications archive
   ```

## Error Handling

### Error: Image cannot be read

```
Cannot analyze image at: [path]

Possible issues:
- File doesn't exist
- File format not supported
- File is corrupted

Solutions:
1. Check the file path and try again
2. Convert image to PNG/JPG format
3. Provide the content as text instead

Would you like to:
- Try a different file
- Enter the communication content manually
```

### Error: mu command not available

```
The `mu` email indexer is not available.

Options:
1. Paste email content directly (I'll parse it)
2. Provide email file path (.eml, .mbox)
3. Install mu: `brew install mu` (macOS) / `apt install maildir-utils` (Linux)

How would you like to proceed?
```

### Error: markitdown conversion failed

```
Could not convert file: [filename]

Error: [markitdown error message]

Options:
1. Try alternative conversion method
2. Extract text manually from file
3. Save original file without conversion
4. Skip this file

What would you like to do?
```

### Error: Timestamp conflict

```
Timestamp Conflict Detected

The timestamp extracted (2025-12-15 14:00) is in the future.
Current time is 2025-12-10 10:00.

Options:
1. Use extracted timestamp anyway (scheduled/future communication)
2. Correct to current date/time
3. Specify actual timestamp

Please clarify:
```

### Error: No RULE.md or communications/ directory

```
Project not initialized for communication tracking.

Options:
1. Initialize communications directory now (recommended)
2. Specify different target directory
3. Cancel

If you choose option 1, I'll ask a few configuration questions first.
```

### Error: Duplicate communication

```
Possible Duplicate Detected

A similar communication already exists:
- [existing file path]
- Date: [date]
- Subject: [subject]

Options:
1. Skip (don't create duplicate)
2. Create anyway (might be different)
3. Update existing entry instead
4. View existing entry first

What would you like to do?
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### With track-meeting Skill

If communication references a meeting:
- Detect meeting mentions ("discussed in meeting", meeting dates)
- Link to meeting notes if they exist
- Suggest creating meeting notes if referenced but not found

```yaml
related_meetings:
  - path: meetings/sprint-planning/2025-12-05_sprint-6-planning.md
    relationship: "discussed"
```

**In meeting documents, add Communications section**:
```markdown
## External Communications Referenced

Communications discussed or referenced in this meeting:
- [2025-12-04: Client Budget Approval](../../communications/by-date/2025-12/2025-12-04_email_budget-approval.md)
- [2025-12-03: Slack thread on API design](../../communications/by-date/2025-12/2025-12-03_screenshot_slack-api.md)
```

### With manage-sprint Skill

If communication mentions sprint work:
- Link to current sprint
- Extract mentioned user stories
- Update sprint document with external communication reference

```
Communication mentions: "User story 5 is blocked"
→ Link to sprint-06/sprint-plan.md
→ Add reference in sprint document's "Related Communications" section
```

**In sprint documents, add section**:
```markdown
## Related Communications

External communications related to this sprint:

### Client Feedback
- [2025-12-10: Phase 2 Approval](../../communications/by-date/2025-12/2025-12-10_14-30_email_project-update.md)

### Team Discussions
- [2025-12-07: Database Migration Decision](../../communications/by-date/2025-12/2025-12-07_09-00_screenshot_slack-db-migration.md)
```

### With track-milestone Skill

If communication updates milestone status:
- Link to relevant milestone
- Suggest milestone status update if communication indicates change
- Track milestone-related decisions

```
Communication says: "Client approved beta release"
→ Link to beta-release milestone
→ Suggest: "Should I update milestone status to 'approved'?"
```

**In milestones.yaml, reference key communications**:
```yaml
milestones:
  - id: beta-release
    name: "Beta Release"
    communications:
      - comm-a1b2c3d4  # Client approval
    approval_communication: comm-a1b2c3d4
```

### With project-search Skill

Communications are searchable:
- Full-text search in content
- Metadata search (from, to, date range)
- Tag-based search
- Timeline-based search

```
User: "Find communications from the client about budget"
→ Search communications with: from contains "client", content contains "budget"
→ Return timeline view of matching communications
```

**Search scope extension for project-search**:
- Include communications/ directory
- Search timeline.yaml for metadata matching
- Support filters: type:email, from:[sender], date:[range]

### With AkashicRecords Skills

If communications need to be stored in knowledge base:
- Use add-content for archival storage
- Cross-reference between communications/ and knowledge base
- Maintain links when content moves

## Best Practices

### 1. Always confirm timestamp

Timestamps are critical for timeline integrity. Never assume - always validate or ask when uncertain.

### 2. Extract key points automatically

Don't just store raw content. Extract actionable information (decisions, action items, deadlines).

### 3. Maintain thread relationships

Connect related communications. Conversations make more sense in context.

### 4. Link to project artifacts

Communications don't exist in isolation. Link to sprints, milestones, meetings.

### 5. Backup originals

Original data (especially screenshots) should be preserved for reference and compliance.

### 6. Use consistent naming

Follow filename conventions strictly: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_type_subject-slug.md`

### 7. Update timeline immediately

Don't batch timeline updates. Each communication should appear in timeline upon tracking.

### 8. Handle uncertainty gracefully

When information is unclear, ask rather than guess. User confirmation prevents errors.

### 9. Preserve original language

Keep content in its original language. Use English for structure (frontmatter, section headers).

### 10. Auto-detect but verify

Auto-detection is helpful but not perfect. Always show extracted information for user verification.

### Example 4: First-Time Setup

```
User: Track this email from my client

Claude: I notice this is the first time using communication tracking.
Let me set up the communications directory first.

Timeline Configuration
Should I create a dedicated timeline tracking file?

User: Yes, both formats

Claude: Original Data Backup
Should I backup original source data?

User: Yes, always backup

Claude: Communication Sources
What types of communications do you typically track?

User: Email and screenshots mainly

Claude: Timestamp Handling
How should I handle communications without clear timestamps?

User: Try to figure it out, ask me if unsure

Claude:
Communication Tracker Configured!

Structure created:
communications/
├── config.yaml
├── README.md
├── timeline.yaml
├── timeline.md
├── raw/
├── by-source/
└── by-date/

Now tracking your email...

[Proceeds to track the email]
```

## Notes

- Communication tracking adds external context to project timeline
- Timeline is the source of truth for chronological project history
- Screenshots require Claude's vision capability for analysis
- Email integration via `mu` is optional - direct text input always works
- Thread tracking maintains conversation continuity across multiple communications
- Backup strategy should align with project/organization compliance requirements
- This Skill complements track-meeting by handling async communications
- Content language is preserved; structure uses English for consistency
- Timestamp confidence is always tracked to maintain timeline integrity

---

Effective communication tracking transforms scattered emails and messages into coherent project history. This Skill bridges the gap between external communications and internal project management.
