## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
Rapidly triage ML training incidents (instability, divergence, degraded metrics) and deliver validated remediations with traceable evidence.

### Triggers
- **Positive:** Failing/unstable training runs, unexplained metric drops, NaNs/exploding gradients, data/label issues, reproducibility gaps.
- **Negative:** New model development without incident (route to `ml-expert`) or lightweight prototyping (route to `ml`).

### Guardrails
- Structure-first: ensure `SKILL.md`, `README`, `examples/`, `tests/`, `resources/`, and `agents/` exist; create missing docs before work.
- Constraint extraction: clarify environment (hardware/framework), data provenance, metric targets, and incident timeline.
- Validation discipline: reproduce issue, isolate variables (data/model/optim), run minimal change tests; adversarially probe for leakage and nondeterminism.
- Confidence ceiling enforced (inference/report 0.70; research 0.85; observation/definition 0.95) with evidence per finding.
- Safety: preserve checkpoints/logs; avoid destructive changes; keep rollback path ready.

### Execution Phases
1. **Intake & Evidence Gathering**
   - Collect logs, metrics, configs, seeds, hardware info, and recent code changes.
   - Confirm baseline vs expected behavior and incident start time.
2. **Reproduction & Isolation**
   - Reproduce on smallest dataset slice; fix seeds; disable randomness.
   - Binary-search variables: data batches, preprocessing, model changes, optimizer settings.
3. **Hypothesis & Experiment Plan**
   - Form hypotheses (data corruption, label leakage, optimizer instability, precision issues).
   - Plan targeted experiments with success/fail criteria.
4. **Fix & Validation**
   - Implement minimal fixes; run controlled tests (train/val curves, gradient norms, loss stats).
   - Validate against performance/latency targets; ensure no regression on baseline metrics.
5. **Handoff & Prevention**
   - Document root cause, applied fixes, and remaining risks.
   - Add monitors/tests to prevent recurrence; package rollback instructions.

### Output Format
- Incident summary and constraints.
- Reproduction steps, hypotheses, and experiments run.
- Fixes applied with before/after metrics.
- Prevention plan and owners.
- Confidence statement with ceiling.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Issue reproduced with fixed seeds and minimal data slice.
- [ ] Hypotheses tested; experiments documented.
- [ ] Metrics reported per split; gradients/loss inspected where relevant.
- [ ] Regression checks executed; rollback path documented.
- [ ] Confidence ceiling stated.
