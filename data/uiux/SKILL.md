# UI/UX Guideline

## Tech Stack

* **Framework**: Next.js
* **Icons**: Iconify

## Non-Negotiables

* WCAG AA accessibility compliance

## Context

UI/UX determines how users perceive and interact with the product. A great UI isn't just "correct" — it's delightful, intuitive, and makes complex tasks feel simple.

The review should consider: does the current design truly serve users well? Or does it need fundamental rethinking? Small tweaks to a flawed design won't make it excellent. If redesign is warranted, propose it.

## Driving Questions

* Where do users get confused, frustrated, or give up?
* If we were designing this from scratch today, what would be different?
* What would make this experience genuinely delightful, not just functional?
* How does the design system enable or constrain good UX?
* What are competitors doing that users might expect?
* Where is the UI just "okay" when it could be exceptional?
