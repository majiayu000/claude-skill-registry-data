# Expansion Playbooks Skill

## When to Use
- Identifying accounts ready for cross-sell or upsell.
- Designing lifecycle campaigns that move customers from adoption to value realization and expansion.
- Partnering with sales/CS to run QBRs, roadmap reviews, or packaging changes.

## Framework
1. **Signal Stack** – product usage milestone, success plan completion, idle licenses, executive sponsor engagement.
2. **Play Types** – roadmap preview, ROI workshop, packaged add-on offer, multi-product bundle, success story swap.
3. **Offer Crafting** – align incentive (discount, pilot, service credits) with customer value narrative.
4. **Execution Channels** – CS outreach, lifecycle nurture, webinars, executive programs.
5. **Measurement** – expansion pipeline, attach rates, ARR per account, payback.

## Templates
- Expansion readiness checklist.
- QBR/EOQ review deck outline.
- Offer matrix (persona x trigger x CTA).

## Tips
- Keep CS + sales alignment tight on ownership and comp.
- Document experiments (pricing, packaging) and share learning loops with product.
- Pair with `customer-insights` to validate readiness signals before outreach.
