# Sales Page Blueprint

Orchestrate the creation of high-converting sales pages by combining specialized skills.

**Audience:** Founders and marketers creating sales pages for products at any price point.

**Goal:** Research competitors, find positioning angles, write conversion copy, and build irresistible offers.

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather initial context:

"I'll help you create a sales page that converts cold traffic into customers.

**Please provide:**
1. **Product/Service**: What are you selling?
2. **Price Point**: What does it cost?
3. **Target Customer**: Who is this for?
4. **Traffic Source**: Where will visitors come from?
5. **Competitors**: Who else sells something similar?

I'll research winning pages in your niche and build a conversion-optimized blueprint."
