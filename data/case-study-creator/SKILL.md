### Step 1: Gather Case Study Inputs

**Required information:**

### Step 2: Case Study Formats

| ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |

| Video script | 2-5 minutes       | YouTube, sales presentations |
| Slide deck   | 8-12 slides       | Presentations, pitches       |

### Step 3: The Classic Case Study Structure

**Problem → Solution → Results (PSR)**

```markdown
## [Compelling headline with key result]

### The Challenge

[What problem did the client face?]
[Why was this problem urgent?]
[What had they tried before?]

### The Solution

[What approach did you take?]
[What specific services/products were used?]
[How did you implement the solution?]

### The Results

[Quantified outcomes]
[Before vs after comparison]
[Unexpected benefits]

### Client Quote

"[Testimonial]" — [Name], [Title], [Company]

### Key Takeaways

- [Takeaway 1]
- [Takeaway 2]
- [Takeaway 3]
```

### Step 4: Headline Formulas

**Result-focused headlines:**

| Formula                                | Example                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| How [Client] [Achieved Result]         | "How Acme Corp Increased Sales 47% in 90 Days" |
| [Client] + [Result] + [Timeframe]      | "TechStart: From 0 to 10K Users in 6 Weeks"    |
| From [Before] to [After]               | "From Manual Chaos to Automated Excellence"    |
| [Number]% [Improvement] for [Industry] | "312% ROI for E-commerce Retailer"             |
| [Client] [Overcomes Challenge]         | "How a Local Bakery Conquered Online Ordering" |

**Headline power words:**

- Achieved, transformed, unlocked, boosted
- Doubled, tripled, skyrocketed, slashed
- Secret, breakthrough, proven, guaranteed

### Step 5: Writing the Challenge Section

**Structure:**

```markdown
### The Challenge

[Company name] is a [brief description] serving [target market].

Before working with us, they struggled with:

- [Pain point 1 with specific detail]
- [Pain point 2 with specific detail]
- [Pain point 3 with specific detail]

**The breaking point:** [What made them seek a solution now?]

"[Quote about the frustration]" — [Client name]

Previous attempts to solve this included [what they tried],
but [why it didn't work].
```

**Example:**

```markdown
### The Challenge

GreenLeaf Organics is a sustainable food company serving
health-conscious consumers across the Netherlands.

Before working with us, they struggled with:

- A website that took 8+ seconds to load on mobile
- Cart abandonment rates of 73%
- Zero organic traffic despite quality products

**The breaking point:** A Black Friday sale crashed their site,
costing them an estimated €50,000 in lost sales.

"We knew our products were great, but our website was driving
customers away before they could even see them." — Maria, Founder

They had tried hiring freelancers twice before, but both times
ended with incomplete projects and wasted budgets.
```

### Step 6: Writing the Solution Section

**Structure:**

```markdown
### The Solution

After analyzing [client]'s situation, we developed a
[timeframe] plan focused on:

**Phase 1: [Name] ([Duration])**
[What you did and why]

**Phase 2: [Name] ([Duration])**
[What you did and why]

**Phase 3: [Name] ([Duration])**
[What you did and why]

Key elements of our approach included:

- [Specific tactic/tool/method 1]
- [Specific tactic/tool/method 2]
- [Specific tactic/tool/method 3]
```

**Show your process:**

| Element       | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Discovery     | How you understood their needs |
| Strategy      | Your unique approach           |
| Execution     | Specific actions taken         |
| Tools used    | Technologies or methods        |
| Collaboration | How you worked together        |

### Step 7: Writing the Results Section

**Quantify everything:**

```markdown
### The Results

Within [timeframe], [client] achieved:

| Metric     | Before  | After   | Improvement |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| [Metric 1] | [Value] | [Value] | [+X%]       |
| [Metric 2] | [Value] | [Value] | [+X%]       |
| [Metric 3] | [Value] | [Value] | [+X%]       |

**Headline result:** [Most impressive outcome in one sentence]

Beyond the numbers, [client] also experienced:

- [Qualitative benefit 1]
- [Qualitative benefit 2]
- [Unexpected positive outcome]
```

**Result categories:**

| Type         | Examples                                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Revenue      | Sales increase, average order value, conversion rate |
| Efficiency   | Time saved, cost reduction, productivity gains       |
| Growth       | New customers, market expansion, user acquisition    |
| Performance  | Speed, uptime, error reduction                       |
| Satisfaction | NPS score, reviews, retention rate                   |

### Step 8: Client Quotes

**Quote types:**

| Type           | Use For                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Problem quote  | Challenge section - their frustration |
| Process quote  | Solution section - working together   |
| Result quote   | Results section - their success       |
| Recommendation | Closing - endorsement                 |

**Strong quote formula:**

```
[Specific result] + [Emotional impact] + [Recommendation]
```

**Examples:**

```markdown
"Our conversion rate jumped from 2% to 6.8%. For the first time,
I actually look forward to checking our analytics. I'd recommend
[Company] to any e-commerce business serious about growth."
— Sarah Chen, CEO, TechGear Pro

"What impressed me most wasn't just the results—it was how easy
they made the whole process. We went from chaos to clarity in
just six weeks."
— Michael Torres, Marketing Director, Acme Corp
```

### Step 9: Visual Elements

**Include where possible:**

| Visual                   | Purpose                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Before/after screenshots | Visual proof of change |
| Results chart            | Data visualization     |
| Client logo              | Brand recognition      |
| Client photo             | Human connection       |
| Process diagram          | Show methodology       |
| Timeline graphic         | Project scope          |

**Chart formatting:**

```markdown
### Traffic Growth Over 6 Months

Month 1: 1,200 visitors
Month 2: 2,400 visitors (+100%)
Month 3: 4,100 visitors (+71%)

## Validation

Before completing:

## Error Handling

- **No metrics available**: Use qualitative results (time saved, stress reduced, goals achieved) and estimate where possible.
- **Client won't be named**: Use "A leading [industry] company" or create anonymized version.
- **No quote available**: Write placeholder and request from client, or paraphrase feedback.
- **Weak results**: Focus on process improvements, lessons learned, or foundation laid for future success.
- **Confidential details**: Omit sensitive specifics; focus on percentages over absolute numbers.
