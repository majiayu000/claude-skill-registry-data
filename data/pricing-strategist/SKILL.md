Whether you're launching a new product or optimizing existing pricing, this provides the analytical rigor and strategic thinking required.

Built on pricing psychology, behavioral economics, and SaaS pricing best practices, this skill combines willingness-to-pay research, competitive analysis, and experimentation frameworks to optimize your most important revenue lever.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Pricing Model Selection
**Choose the right pricing structure for your business**

1. **Common Pricing Models**

   **Cost-Plus Pricing**
   - Formula: Cost + Markup % = Price
   - Pros: Simple, ensures margin
   - Cons: Ignores customer value, leaves money on table
   - Best for: Commodities, manufacturing, retail

   **Competitive Pricing**
   - Formula: Match or undercut competitor prices
   - Pros: Fast to market, safe
   - Cons: Race to bottom, ignores your unique value
   - Best for: Undifferentiated markets, price-sensitive customers

   **Value-Based Pricing**
   - Formula: Price based on value delivered to customer
   - Pros: Maximizes revenue, aligns with customer outcomes
   - Cons: Requires deep customer understanding
   - Best for: Differentiated products, B2B SaaS, consulting

   **Freemium**
   - Formula: Free tier + paid premium tiers
   - Pros: Low barrier, viral growth, try before buy
   - Cons: Conversion rate typically 2-5%, support costs
   - Best for: PLG (product-led growth), network effects

   **Usage-Based Pricing**
   - Formula: Pay per unit consumed (API calls, seats, GB, transactions)
   - Pros: Aligns cost with value, grows with customer
   - Cons: Unpredictable revenue, complex billing
   - Best for: Infrastructure, APIs, marketplaces

   **Tiered Pricing**
   - Formula: Good/Better/Best packages at different price points
   - Pros: Customer segmentation, upsell path, price discrimination
   - Cons: Complexity, analysis paralysis
   - Best for: SaaS, subscriptions, services

   **Performance-Based Pricing**
   - Formula: Fee tied to results delivered (% of savings, revenue share)
   - Pros: Aligns incentives, de-risks for customer
   - Cons: Hard to measure, revenue uncertainty
   - Best for: Consulting, AdTech, FinTech

2. **Model Selection Criteria**
   - Customer preference (how do they want to buy?)
   - Competitive norms (what's standard in industry?)
   - Value delivery (when does customer realize value?)
   - Revenue predictability (do you need stable MRR?)
   - Sales motion (self-serve vs. enterprise sales?)

### Workflow 2: Willingness to Pay Research
**Understand what customers will actually pay**

1. **Research Methods**

   **Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter**
   Ask 4 questions:
   - At what price is this too expensive (wouldn't consider)?
   - At what price is this expensive (but would consider)?
   - At what price is this a bargain?
   - At what price is this too cheap (would question quality)?

   Plot responses to find:
   - **Optimal Price Point**: Intersection of "expensive" and "bargain"
   - **Acceptable Price Range**: Between "too expensive" and "too cheap"

   **Conjoint Analysis**
   - Present customers with product bundles with varying features and prices
   - Ask to choose preferred bundle
   - Statistically derive feature value and price sensitivity
   - Reveals trade-offs customers make

   **Competitor Analysis**
   - Research competitor pricing (public pricing pages, sales calls)
   - Identify pricing tiers and feature differentiation
   - Map value proposition vs. price
   - Find gaps and opportunities

   **Customer Interviews**
   - Ask about current spend on alternatives
   - Budget authority (how much can they approve without escalation?)
   - ROI expectations (what value justifies investment?)
   - Pricing structure preferences

2. **Segmentation**
   Different customer segments have different willingness to pay:
   - **By company size**: SMB vs. Mid-Market vs. Enterprise
   - **By use case**: High-value vs. low-value applications
   - **By geography**: Purchasing power varies by region
   - **By industry**: Some industries have higher budgets

   Tailor pricing tiers to segments.

### Workflow 3: Pricing Tier Design
**Structure pricing tiers to maximize revenue and customer fit**

1. **Tier Strategy**

   **3-Tier Model (Most Common)**
   - **Starter/Basic** (Anchor):
     - Purpose: Low barrier entry, volume play
     - Price: $X/month (affordable, minimal friction)
     - Features: Core functionality, limited usage
     - Target: Small businesses, individuals, trials

   - **Professional/Growth** (Target):
     - Purpose: Optimized for ideal customer, highest volume
     - Price: 3-5x Basic (most choose this)
     - Features: Full functionality, higher limits, integrations
     - Target: Core market, majority of customers

   - **Enterprise** (Aspiration):
     - Purpose: Anchor high end, premium features, custom
     - Price: "Contact us" or 10x+ Basic
     - Features: Unlimited, advanced, white-glove support, SLAs
     - Target: Large companies, high-value customers

2. **Feature Gating Strategy**
   - **Good Tier**: Core features that deliver basic value
   - **Better Tier**: Add productivity features, higher limits, integrations
   - **Best Tier**: Add enterprise features (SSO, advanced security, SLA, dedicated support)

   Gate features by:
   - **Usage limits**: 10 projects vs. unlimited
   - **Advanced features**: Automations, AI, analytics
   - **Integrations**: API access, Zapier, Salesforce
   - **Support**: Email vs. chat vs. phone + CSM
   - **SLAs**: Uptime guarantees, response times

3. **Pricing Anchoring**
   - **Decoy Effect**: Add expensive tier to make mid-tier seem reasonable
   - **Price Anchoring**: Show "Most Popular" badge on target tier
   - **Contrast**: Strike-through annual pricing to show monthly equivalent savings
   - **Loss Aversion**: "Save $200/year" vs. "Pay $17/month"

4. **Annual vs. Monthly**
   - Offer both with 10-30% annual discount
   - Annual benefits: Cash upfront, lower churn, commitment
   - Monthly benefits: Lower barrier, easier to try
   - Position annual as better value ("Save 2 months")

### Workflow 4: Pricing Psychology & Tactics
**Leverage behavioral economics to optimize perceived value**

1. **Psychological Pricing Tactics**

   **Charm Pricing ($99 vs. $100)**
   - Ending in .99 or .95 feels significantly cheaper
   - Best for: Consumer products, B2C
   - Avoid for: Enterprise (seems cheap)

   **Prestige Pricing (Round Numbers)**
   - $1,000 feels premium vs. $999
   - Best for: Luxury, enterprise

   **Price Anchoring**
   - Show higher price first, then discount
   - "Was $299, Now $199" (30% off)
   - Reference competitor pricing to anchor high

   **Decoy Pricing**
   - Introduce asymmetrically dominated option
   - Example: Small ($3), Large ($7), Medium ($6.50)
   - Medium seems like bad deal, customers choose Large

   **Bundling**
   - Combine products/features at discount vs. a la carte
   - Increases perceived value
   - "Everything you need in one plan"

   **Good-Better-Best Positioning**
   - Make middle tier the "Goldilocks" choice
   - Add "Most Popular" badge
   - Limit choice to 3 options (paradox of choice)

2. **Framing & Presentation**
   - **Per-unit pricing**: "$5 per user/month" (scales with value)
   - **Total cost framing**: "$60/year" vs. "$5/month" (depends on goal)
   - **Feature emphasis**: Lead with value, price secondary
   - **Money-back guarantee**: De-risk purchase decision
   - **Social proof**: "Join 10,000+ customers"

### Workflow 5: Pricing Experimentation & Optimization
**Test pricing changes scientifically to maximize revenue**

1. **Experimentation Framework**

   **A/B Testing**
   - Test pricing changes with cohorts
   - 50% see Price A, 50% see Price B
   - Measure: Conversion rate, revenue per visitor, LTV
   - Run until statistical significance (usually 100+ conversions)
   - Choose winning variant

   **Grandfather Clause**
   - When raising prices, let existing customers keep old pricing
   - Reduces churn, builds goodwill
   - Eventually sunset after 12-24 months

   **Beta Pricing**
   - Launch at lower "early access" pricing
   - Increase as you add features and mature
   - Communicate value growth justifies price increase

   **Cohort Analysis**
   - Compare customer cohorts by pricing experienced
   - LTV, churn, expansion by price point
   - Identify optimal price/value balance

2. **What to Test**
   - **Price levels**: $99 vs. $149 vs. $199
   - **Tier structure**: 2-tier vs. 3-tier vs. 4-tier
   - **Feature gates**: What features in each tier?
   - **Pricing display**: Annual vs. monthly default
   - **Discount strategy**: 20% off vs. 2 months free
   - **Payment terms**: Monthly vs. annual vs. quarterly

3. **Metrics to Track**
   - **Conversion rate**: % of visitors who purchase
   - **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: Total revenue / customers
   - **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**: ARPU × (1 / churn rate)
   - **Price elasticity**: % change in demand / % change in price
   - **Tier distribution**: % of customers in each tier

4. **When to Raise Prices**
   - **Product maturity**: Added significant value/features
   - **Market validation**: Strong demand, low churn
   - **Competitive positioning**: Still below competitors
   - **Customer feedback**: "Too cheap" concerns
   - **New customer only**: Grandfather existing (avoids churn)

### Workflow 6: Packaging & Discounting Strategy
**Design packages and discounts that drive revenue**

1. **Package Design**
   - **Single Product Tiers**: Basic, Pro, Enterprise (SaaS)
   - **Multi-Product Bundles**: Suite vs. individual products
   - **Add-ons**: Base platform + a la carte features
   - **Usage-Based + Base Fee**: Hybrid model

2. **Discount Strategy**
   - **Annual Discount**: 10-30% off (standard for SaaS)
   - **Volume Discount**: Tiered pricing (10+ seats = 10% off)
   - **Launch Discount**: Early adopter pricing (limited time)
   - **Nonprofit/Education**: 30-50% discount (goodwill, low CAC)
   - **Contract Length**: Multi-year commitments (3-year = 15% off)

3. **When to Discount (Carefully)**
   - **Enterprise sales**: Expected part of negotiation
   - **Annual commitment**: To secure longer contract
   - **Competitive displacement**: Win deal from competitor
   - **End of quarter**: Sales team closing deals
   - **Upsell**: Discount expansion to grow account

4. **When NOT to Discount**
   - **Self-serve SMB**: Trains customers to expect discounts
   - **High-velocity sales**: Erodes margins at scale
   - **Strong product-market fit**: You have leverage
   - **First ask**: Make them earn it (ask for annual, reference, etc.)

## Best Practices

### Research & Analysis
- Interview 20+ customers about willingness to pay
- Analyze competitor pricing before setting yours
- Test pricing with beta customers before launch
- Use multiple research methods (don't rely on one)
- Segment pricing by customer type

### Pricing Design
- Start simple—add complexity later
- Make default choice obvious ("Most Popular")
- Ensure clear value differentiation between tiers
- Don't over-gate features (freemium conversion killer)
- Price on value, not cost

### Communication
- Explain value, not just features
- Show ROI and payback period
- Transparent pricing on website (for SMB)
- Custom pricing for enterprise (protect margin)
- Price increase notices: 30-60 days, explain value added

### Experimentation
- Change one variable at a time
- Run tests to statistical significance
- Document learnings and iterate
- Grandfather existing customers when raising prices
- Monitor churn closely after changes

### Optimization
- Review pricing quarterly
- Track tier distribution (80% in middle tier = good design)
- Measure price sensitivity with small tests
- Raise prices annually (2-3% inflation minimum)
- Don't be afraid to charge more

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Pricing too low**: Undervaluing your product, leaving money on table
- **Copying competitors**: Not considering your unique value
- **Too many tiers**: Choice paralysis (limit to 3-4)
- **Confusing value metrics**: Unclear what customer is paying for
- **Feature bloat**: Putting everything in basic tier
- **No price increases**: Inflation erodes revenue over time
- **Discounting by default**: Trains customers to expect it
- **Ignoring psychology**: Not using anchoring, framing, charm pricing
- **No experimentation**: Guessing instead of testing
