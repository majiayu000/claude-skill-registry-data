# Training Content Creator

## Overview

The Training Content Creator skill helps generate high-quality training materials including workbooks, facilitator notes, practice scenarios, and activity instructions. It creates content that follows brain-friendly principles and integrates TBR 4Cs framework and 70:20:10 learning design.

## When to Use This Skill

Use Training Content Creator when:
- Writing learner workbooks and guide materials
- Creating practice scenarios and exercises
- Developing facilitator guides with exact talking points
- Generating discussion questions for concept processing
- Writing real-world application case studies
- Creating activity instructions and handouts
- Developing job aids and quick reference cards

## Content Creation Process

### 1. Concept Chunk Content

Transform learning objectives into digestible concept delivery:

**Structure**:
- Hook/real-world connection (1-2 sentences)
- Core concept explanation (2-4 sentences, max)
- Visual/concrete example from real work
- Key takeaway
- Processing question

**Writing guidelines**:
- Short sentences (15 words average)
- Active voice ("Do X" not "Should be done")
- Real-world examples over abstract theory
- Learner-centric language

### 2. Processing Activity Content

Create activities after each concept chunk:

**Think-Pair-Share Prompts**:
- Open-ended questions (not yes/no)
- Relevant to learner's real work
- Takes 2-3 minutes to discuss

**Written Reflection Prompts**:
- Prompt learners to apply concept to their work
- Guide thinking without prescribing answers
- Takes 2-3 minutes to write

**Discussion Questions**:
- Spark thinking (not test knowledge)
- Multiple valid answers
- Encourage peer learning

### 3. Practice Activity Content

Write guided, collaborative, and independent practice scenarios:

**Guided Practice Instructions**:
- Step-by-step walkthrough
- Exact language for modeling
- Pause points for questions
- Key decision points highlighted

**Collaborative Practice Tasks**:
- Clear group assignment
- New scenario (different from guided)
- Success criteria
- "What to watch for" notes for facilitators

**Independent Practice Tasks**:
- Mirror actual job work
- Self-assessment prompts
- Optional support available
- Reflection questions

### 4. Facilitator Guide Content

Create notes that help facilitators deliver effectively:

**Include**:
- Exact timing for each section
- Key phrases to use
- Common questions and answers
- Transition language
- Backup activities or timing adjustments

### 5. Workbook Content

Create learner materials that support and extend learning:

**Include**:
- Session overview and objectives
- Concept summaries (not transcripts)
- Space for notes
- Practice scenario details
- Job aids and quick references
- Commitment/reflection sections

## Content Quality Standards

**Brain-Friendly**:
- Scannable (not dense paragraphs)
- Multimodal (visual + text + examples)
- Active learning prompts
- Real work examples

**Engaging**:
- Conversational tone (not formal academic)
- Specific examples over generalizations
- Learner-centric (not instructor-centric)
- Action-oriented language

**Practical**:
- Directly applicable to real work
- Clear next steps
- Support for implementation
- Measurable outcomes

## Content Types & Templates

Reference files provide detailed templates for:

- Concept chunk delivery format
- Processing activity prompts
- Practice scenario structures
- Facilitator note format
- Workbook page design
- Job aid creation
- Quick reference card layout

## Integration with Other Skills

- Use **training-designer** output as content blueprint
- Coordinate with **workshop-facilitator-prep** for facilitator notes
- Ensure alignment with **training-reviewer** standards
- Support **learning-journey-builder** learning ecosystem

## Writing Best Practices

✅ **Do**:
- Write for learning (not to show expertise)
- Use real work examples
- Create processing activities
- Keep it scannable
- Test with sample learner

❌ **Don't**:
- Copy textbook definitions
- Overwhelm with comprehensive coverage
- Create passive reading materials
- Use jargon without explanation
- Forget the "why" behind concepts
