# Festival Operations Manual

Expert operational guidance compiled from the Winter Festival team's collective expertise. This skill provides actionable protocols for common scenarios faced during festival operations.

## 🎭 Customer Experience (Madame Zelda's Expertise)

### Handling Difficult Customers
- **Always acknowledge their frustration first** - Validate their feelings before proposing solutions
- **Offer alternatives, never just say "no"** - Frame solutions positively
- **20+ minute wait?** Bump them up with a "VIP reading" - Turns complaints into compliments
- **Dealing with skeptics?** Use the "mysterious stranger" fortune style - it wins them over
- **Kids under 10?** Use the "adventure quest" style - parents love it and kids stay engaged

### Keeping the Line Moving
- **Fortunes should be 2-3 minutes max** - Balance quality with efficiency
- **Chatty customers?** Offer an "extended reading" slot for later in the day
- **During rush periods:** Always have 5 pre-written fortunes ready for quick service
- **Queue management:** Use visual time estimates to set expectations

### VIP Experience Tips
- Personalize greetings when possible
- Maintain mysterious ambiance even during busy times
- End each reading with a call-back element ("Remember the card I drew for you...")

## 🛡️ Security & Vendor Relations (Marcus's Expertise)

### Vendor Management Protocols

#### Pre-Setup Requirements
- **Food vendors: Check health permits BEFORE setup** - Not negotiable, not after
- **Verify insurance certificates** - Must be current and cover festival dates
- **Confirm electrical/utility needs** - Prevent last-minute infrastructure issues

#### Noise Complaint Escalation Protocol
**Important:** Follow this exact sequence - document each step
1. **First warning: Verbal** - Friendly reminder of noise limits
2. **Second warning: Written** - Document time, nature of complaint, expected compliance
3. **Third incident: Shutdown** - No exceptions, remove vendor for the day

#### Vendor Disputes
- **Never take sides publicly** - Maintain neutral mediator role
- **Mediate in the back office** - Keep disputes out of public view

#### Payment Protocols
- **50% upfront** - Required before setup begins
- **Balance day-of** - Collect before gates open if possible

## 📦 Lost & Found Operations (Maria's Expertise)

### Intake Process (CRITICAL: Follow Every Step)
1. **Photo EVERYTHING before storing** - Helps with remote claims
2. **Tag with complete details:**
   - Item description (be specific: "Blue iPhone 13 with cracked screen")
   - Location found (specific booth/area)
   - Time found (exact time helps narrow claims)
   - Finder's name (for follow-up/rewards)
3. **High-value items → Locked cabinet** - Phones, wallets, jewelry, keys
4. **Perishables disposed after 2 hours** - Food safety and storage space

### Claiming Process (Prevent Fraud)
- **Ask claimants to describe BEFORE showing** - Prevents false claims
- **Check ID for high-value items** - Match name to contents when possible
- **Log all claims** - Both successful and unsuccessful (patterns help)
- **Unclaimed items after 30 days → Charity** - Clear documented process

### Common Loss Patterns (Check These First!)
- **Ice rink = Mittens and scarves** - Kids take them off, forget them
- **Food court = Phones and wallets** - People set them down while eating
- **Kids areas = Stuffed animals** - URGENT priority, kids are devastated
- **Bathrooms = Jackets and bags** - Hung on hooks and forgotten
- **Entrance/Exit = Single gloves** - Falls out of pockets

### Pro Tips
- Check lost & found bin hourly during peak times
- Proactively announce "stuffed animal found" near kids areas
- Keep commonly lost items visible (mittens, hats) for quick matching
- Take photos of distinctive items for social media posts

## 📢 Marketing & Communications (Elena's Expertise)

### Last-Minute Request Timeline

#### Poster Changes
- **Minimum 2 hours needed** - Print shop turnaround time
- **Rush fees apply** - Budget consideration

#### Social Media Posts
- **15 minutes if content provided** - Have copy and images ready
- **30 minutes if we create content** - Photography and writing time
- **1 hour for approval chain** - If director/sponsor sign-off needed

#### Press Inquiries
- **Route to Festival Director** - Never speak on record yourself
- **Collect contact info:** Name, outlet, deadline, topic
- **Flag urgency level** - Breaking news vs. feature story timing

#### Sponsor Logo Additions
- **Check contract first** - Some sponsors have exclusivity clauses
- **Verify brand guidelines** - Colors, sizing, placement rules

### Emergency Communication Protocol

  - Update website homepage
  - Text alerts (if system enabled)
- **Include:** New timing, what to expect, how to get updates

#### Event Cancellations

  1. **Email ticket holders FIRST** - They have financial stake
  2. **Update website** - Create dedicated cancellation page
  3. **Public announcement** - Social media and press
  4. **Refund process communication** - Within 24 hours
- **Include:** Reason, refund process, rescheduling info

#### Good News Announcements

- **Email newsletter follows** - More detailed storytelling
- **Press release** - For major milestones

### Communication Channel Selection Guide
- **Urgent + Paid customers = Email + Text**
- **Urgent + General public = Social media**

- **Media relations = Press release + phone call**
- **Internal only = Staff group chat**
