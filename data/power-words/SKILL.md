## What Are Power Words?

Emotionally charged words that trigger psychological responses:
- Grab attention in crowded feeds
- Create urgency and desire
- Build trust and authority
- Drive action and conversion

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

1. **What copy needs enhancement?** (headline, email, ad, landing page, CTA)
2. **What emotion should it evoke?** (urgency, trust, curiosity, fear, desire)
3. **What action do you want?** (click, buy, sign up, share)
4. **Current copy** — Paste the text to enhance

## The 21 Categories (Summary)

| Category | Trigger | Best For |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Impatience** | FOMO, speed | Launches, CTAs |
| **Beauty** | Aesthetic desire | Fashion, design |
| **Lust** | Deep craving | Food, luxury |
| **Indulgence** | Permission to enjoy | Self-care, treats |
| **Excitement** | Thrill-seeking | Events, launches |
| **Novelty** | Curiosity | Content teasers |
| **Memorability** | Stand out | Personal brand |
| **Happiness** | Well-being | Wellness, community |
| **Prestige** | Status | Premium products |
| **Simplicity** | Avoid complexity | How-tos, guides |
| **Sadness** | Fear of loss | Problem-aware content |

## Enhancement Process

### Step 1: Identify Weakness
- Bland verbs? (get, have, make)
- Generic adjectives? (good, great, nice)
- Passive voice?
- No emotional hook?

### Step 2: Match Emotion to Goal

| Goal | Primary Category | Secondary |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| Sales/Conversion | Greed, Urgency | Exclusivity |
| Trust/Authority | Authority | Completeness |
| Engagement | Novelty | Mind-blowing |
| Fear-based | Safety, Sadness | Savagery |
| Desire-based | Lust, Beauty | Prestige |
| FOMO | Exclusivity | Impatience |

### Step 3: Strategic Replacement

**Rule of 3:** Use 2-3 power words per headline/CTA. More feels forced.

**Placement priority:**
1. First 3 words (hook)
2. Last word (memory anchor)
3. Action word (CTA verb)

## Examples

**Impatience:**
- Before: "Get started today"
- After: "**Jumpstart** your growth today"

**Novelty:**
- Before: "New marketing tips"
- After: "**Shocking** marketing **hacks** that feel like **magic**"

**Simplicity:**
- Before: "Learn email marketing"
- After: "The **stupid-simple** email marketing **cheat-sheet**"

**Greed:**
- Before: "Get 50% off"
- After: "**Steal** this deal — **50% off** ends **today**"

**Exclusivity:**
- Before: "Marketing tips"
- After: "**Little-known** marketing **secrets** the **elite** won't **divulge**"
