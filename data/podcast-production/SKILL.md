# Podcast Production Skill

## Overview

Transform a raw podcast transcript into polished, multi-platform content assets through four strategic checkpoints. Each checkpoint delivers decision-ready analysis in a markdown file for your feedback before proceeding. You'll provide feedback directly in the checkpoint documents, then we'll iterate before moving to the next phase. Final outputs include publication-ready YouTube strategy and a narrative-driven blog post.

**Workflow Structure:**
- Start with `[Guest]_Source_Material.md` (raw transcript + notes)
- Create `Checkpoint_1_Story_Discovery.md` (your feedback here)
- Create `Checkpoint_2_Cold_Opens_and_Clips.md` (your feedback here)
- Create `Checkpoint_3_YouTube_Strategy.md` (your feedback here)
- Create `Checkpoint_4_Polished_Transcript_and_Blog.md` (final deliverable)

## When to Use This Skill

- You have a raw podcast transcript and need to identify the strongest marketing angle
- You want to create a cold open that hooks listeners immediately
- You need YouTube titles and thumbnail strategies
- You're creating social clips from podcast material
- You want to create SEO-optimized blog content from the episode
- You want all assets aligned with your brand identity

## THE FOUR CHECKPOINTS

### Checkpoint 1: Story Discovery (90-120 min)

**Goal**: Find the primary story arc that will anchor all episode assets.

**Method**: Narrative Snippets - mine the transcript for story beats, not just "big ideas."

**The Reframe**:
- Old approach: List "Big Ideas" → Find clips to illustrate them
- New approach: Find the STORY → The big idea emerges from the story's insight beat

**Your deliverable**: `Checkpoint_1_Story_Discovery.md`

**What it contains**:
- 2-3 Story Arcs identified (6-beat structure)
- Primary Arc selected with rationale
- The Big Idea (derived from Insight/Reflection beats)
- Preview of derived assets (cold open direction, title direction)
- Chapter Outline (timestamped)
- Quote Bank (organized by story beat)

**The 6 Beats to Look For**:
| Beat | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1. Setup | Protagonist in their world |
| 2. Disaster | Something disrupts the status quo |
| 3. Failed Approach | Obvious solution backfires |
| 4. Insight | Realization that changes everything |
| 5. Resolution | Applied insight works |
| 6. Reflection | Universal takeaway |

**User decision point**: Is the selected story arc the strongest?

**Reference**: See `references/checkpoint-1-narrative-snippets.md` for detailed methodology

### Checkpoint 2: Cold Opens & Clips (120-150 min)

**Prerequisites**: Checkpoint 1 complete + Big Idea selected

**Goal**: Create one approved cold open script and identify 3 approved social clips with on-screen hooks.

**Your deliverable**: `Checkpoint_2_Cold_Opens_and_Clips.md`

**What it contains**:
- One selected cold open script (22-35 seconds, verbatim clips arranged for narrative momentum)
- On-screen text hooks (2-4 words each for social media captions)
- 3 approved social clips (1:00-1:30 each, full verbatim transcripts)
- Each clip includes: duration, on-screen hook, full transcript, platform recommendations, use case
- Design specifications (font, placement, timing)

**Output format**:
- Cold open: Simple clip sequence with speaker labels and timestamps
- Clips: Verbatim, with complementary on-screen hooks (not redundant)
- Hooks: 2-4 words maximum for mobile readability
- All clips ready to copy/paste directly into production

**Skills used**:
- **video-caption-creation**: For on-screen text hooks and short-form video captions (generates 3-5 hook options per clip)
- **cold-open-creator**: For cold open methodology (optional reference)

**User decision point**: Approve cold open and social clips for Checkpoint 3

**Reference**: See `references/checkpoint-2-template.md` for detailed template

---

### Checkpoint 3: YouTube Strategy (90-120 min)

**Prerequisites**: Checkpoint 2 complete + Cold open selected

**Goal**: Define YouTube title, thumbnail, description, and chapter timestamps.

**Your deliverable**: `Checkpoint_3_YouTube_Strategy.md`

**What it contains**:
- **Step 1: 10 YouTube title options** → GET USER APPROVAL BEFORE PROCEEDING
- **Step 2: Thumbnail specification** (created AFTER title approval - must complement, not repeat title)
- YouTube description (opening hook sentence + full description + resources + chapters)
- Cold open script (verbatim clips)
- All 3 approved social clips with on-screen hooks
- Chapter breakdown (5-10 words per chapter title, keyword-rich)

**Critical workflow**: Title selection gates thumbnail creation. Do not propose thumbnails until title is approved.

**Skills used**:
- **youtube-title-creator**: For YouTube title strategy
- **brand-identity-wizard**: For brand alignment verification (if brand profile exists)

**Output format**:
- Clean, streamlined specifications (no technical jargon)
- Chapter titles follow "My First Million" style (compelling, descriptive)
- Format: `(MM:SS) - Descriptive Chapter Title` (5-10 words max)
- Description: Opening hook + full description + resources + chapters
- Thumbnail: Simple visual + minimal text (2-4 words only)
- All clips ready to copy/paste

**User decision point**: Approve final specifications and move to Checkpoint 4

**Reference**: See `references/checkpoint-3-template.md` for detailed template

---

### Checkpoint 4: Polished Transcript & Blog Post (120-180 min)

**Prerequisites**: Checkpoint 3 complete + All selections locked

**Goal**: Create publication-ready transcript and SEO-optimized blog post.

**Your deliverables**:
- `[Guest]_YouTube_and_Show_Notes.md` (refined from Checkpoint 3)
- `[Guest]_Polished_Transcript.md` (new, contains transcript + blog)

**What it contains**:
- Full polished transcript (cleaned for readability)
- Embedded blog post (~1,000 words) focused on core insight
- Guest bio and resource links
- SEO headers and structure

**Skills used**:
- **transcript-polisher**: For transcript cleanup and formatting
- **podcast-blog-post-creator**: For narrative-driven blog post creation (if using this skill)

**Output structure**:
1. `[Guest]_YouTube_and_Show_Notes.md` - Handoff file for video production (title, thumbnail, cold open, show notes, timestamps)
2. `[Guest]_Polished_Transcript.md` - Publication-ready transcript with embedded blog post

**Reference**: See `references/checkpoint-4-template.md` for detailed template

## KEY PRINCIPLES

### Verbatim Only
All quoted transcript must be exactly as spoken. You can cut/rearrange, never paraphrase.

### Mine the Entire Transcript
Don't limit analysis to one section. The strongest angle might be anywhere.

### Bold Over Safe
Surprising, contrarian moments beat safe, obvious observations.

### Story Over Summary
Create narrative momentum. Clips should have complete arcs, not just be "good quotes."

### Simple Over Complex
- Thumbnails: 3 elements max
- Titles: One clear idea
- Clips: Clear beginning, middle, end

### Brand Aligned
All outputs should reflect your brand's visual and tonal guidelines. Your target audience should see themselves.

## QUALITY GATES (At Each Decision Point)

### Before Checkpoint 1 -> Checkpoint 2:
**Is the story discovery complete?**
- Primary story arc has at least 4 of 6 beats identified?
- The Insight beat (beat 4) is non-obvious and compelling?
- The Reflection beat (beat 6) has universal application?
- Alternative story arcs were considered?
- Big Idea clearly derives from the story (not stated separately)?
- Have you mined the entire transcript (not just first/last sections)?
- Quote bank is organized by story beat?

### Before Checkpoint 2 -> Checkpoint 3:
**Does the cold open work?**
- Passes 4 out of 5 quality tests? (Stranger, Itch, Stakes, Tease, Emotion)
- Ends with unresolved cliffhanger (doesn't answer the question)?
- All clips are verbatim (no paraphrasing)?
- Duration is 22-35 seconds?
- Social clips have distinct angles (not all making same point)?
- On-screen hooks are 2-4 words max?

### Before Checkpoint 3 -> Checkpoint 4:
**Is the strategy aligned?**
- YouTube title clearly communicates core finding?
- Title includes guest name for authority?
- Thumbnail is simple (2-4 words only)?
- Thumbnail visual is complementary (not redundant with title)?
- Description hook is compelling (1 sentence)?
- Chapter titles are 5-10 words (keyword-rich, compelling)?
- All resources/links are correct?
- Aligned with your brand?

### Before Checkpoint 4 -> Publication:
**Are final assets publication-ready?**
- Transcript is clean and readable?
- Blog post is ~1,000 words with clear narrative arc?
- All quotes are verbatim with proper attribution?
- Guest bio includes credentials and links?
- SEO headers present and optimized?
- Tone is conversational (sounds like you, not formal)?
- Ready for blog publishing?
- Social clips ready to post with on-screen hooks?

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- Using only one section of transcript (mine the entire episode)
- Paraphrasing quotes (all quotes must be verbatim)
- Creating complex thumbnails (keep to 3 elements max)
- Choosing the "safe" angle instead of the surprising one
- Making cold open too long (25-35 seconds max)
- Resolving the cliffhanger (always cut before the answer)
- Skipping quality gates (get approval before each phase)
- Making blog post too long or too short (target ~1,000 words)
- Burying guest credentials (introduce early and naturally)
- Writing blog post in formal tone (write like you're talking to your audience)
