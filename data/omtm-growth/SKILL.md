# OMTM Growth Framework

Apply YC's three-pillar growth system when users discuss startup growth, metrics, or accountability.

## The Framework

### Pillar 1: One Metric That Matters (OMTM)

**Definition:** The single number that best captures the health of your business RIGHT NOW.

**Selection Criteria:**
- Directly tied to revenue or retention
- Movable by your current team
- Leading indicator (not lagging)
- Simple enough to explain in one sentence

**OMTM by Stage:**

| Stage | Typical OMTM | Why |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| Pre-launch | Waitlist signups | Demand validation |
| Pre-revenue | Active users | Engagement before monetization |
| Early revenue | Weekly revenue | Direct business health |
| Product-market fit | Net revenue retention | Sustainable growth signal |
| Growth | MRR growth rate | Scalability proof |

**OMTM by Business Type:**

| Business | OMTM | NOT This |
|----------|------|----------|
| SaaS | Weekly active users OR MRR | Total signups |
| Marketplace | Weekly GMV | Registered users |
| E-commerce | Weekly revenue | Traffic |
| Content | Weekly engaged readers | Pageviews |
| B2B Services | Pipeline value | Proposals sent |

**OMTM Anti-Patterns:**
- Vanity metrics (followers, downloads, registrations)
- Composite metrics nobody can move directly
- Metrics that make you feel good but don't predict success
- Changing OMTM every week

### Pillar 2: 7% Weekly Growth

**The Math:**
```
7% weekly = 1.07^52 = 33x annual growth
5% weekly = 1.05^52 = 12x annual growth
10% weekly = 1.10^52 = 142x annual growth
```

**Why 7%:**
- Ambitious but achievable for early-stage
- Compounds to meaningful scale
- Forces weekly experimentation
- Creates urgency without burnout

**Weekly Growth Calculation:**
```
Growth Rate = (This Week - Last Week) / Last Week × 100

Example:
Last week: 100 users
This week: 107 users
Growth: (107-100)/100 = 7%
```

**Tracking Template:**

| Week | OMTM Value | Growth % | Cumulative | Notes |
|------|------------|----------|------------|-------|
| 1 | 100 | - | 100 | Baseline |
| 2 | 107 | 7% | 107 | [What drove it] |
| 3 | 114 | 6.5% | 114 | [What drove it] |

**When You Miss 7%:**
1. Don't panic - single weeks vary
2. Analyze what slowed growth
3. Double down on what worked before
4. Ship faster next week
5. If 3+ weeks below target → reassess strategy

### Pillar 3: Public Accountability

**Why Public:**
- Eliminates self-deception
- Creates external pressure to perform
- Builds audience/community
- Attracts help and opportunities

**Accountability Mechanisms:**

| Method | Effort | Pressure | Audience |
|--------|--------|----------|----------|
| Twitter/X updates | Low | Medium | Public |
| Investor updates | Medium | High | Investors |
| Mastermind group | Medium | High | Peers |
| Public dashboard | High | Very High | Everyone |
| Blog posts | High | Medium | Followers |

**Weekly Update Template:**
```
Week [X] Update:

OMTM: [Metric Name]
Last Week: [Value]
This Week: [Value]
Growth: [X]%

What worked:
- [Specific action → result]

What didn't:
- [Specific action → result]

Next week focus:
- [Specific action with expected impact]
```

**Accountability Partner Selection:**
- Someone who will actually call you out
- Preferably another founder at similar stage
- Weekly sync, same day/time
- Both share numbers, no hiding

## Application

### When User Asks About Growth

1. **Check for OMTM:** Do they have ONE metric? If multiple, help narrow.
2. **Check the math:** Is their target realistic? Use 7% as benchmark.
3. **Check accountability:** Who knows their numbers? Suggest public sharing.

### Red Flags to Address

| User Says | Red Flag | Response |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| "We track DAU, MAU, revenue, NPS..." | No focus | Help identify THE one |
| "We're growing 2% monthly" | Too slow | Reframe to weekly, increase ambition |
| "I review metrics quarterly" | Too infrequent | Suggest weekly rhythm |
| "Nobody knows our numbers" | No accountability | Suggest public sharing |

### Pushback Responses

**"7% weekly is unrealistic"**
→ "What's your current weekly growth? Even 5% = 12x annual. The number matters less than the weekly discipline."

**"We can't share numbers publicly"**
→ "Share with one accountability partner. The point is external pressure, not public disclosure."

**"Our business doesn't work that way"**
→ "Every business has a leading indicator. What number, if it went up, would guarantee future success?"

## Integration with Other Skills
