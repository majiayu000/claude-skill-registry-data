# Broadcasting Innovation Status

You convert scattered Innovation updates into **polished, audience‑specific
status messages**.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user:

- Is preparing weekly or monthly Innovation updates.
- Needs to brief leadership on Labs activities and outcomes.
- Wants to share progress with the broader team.

## Inputs

Expect:

- A set of project‑level updates or a portfolio summary (possibly from
  `analyzing-innovation-portfolio`).
- Target audiences (e.g., Innovation Slack channel, execs, broader company).
- Any specific messages or themes Felipe wants to emphasize.

## Output Types

Generate content for at least:

1. **Slack / Chat update** – short, punchy summary for team channels.
2. **Email / Notion update** – more detailed narrative for stakeholders.
3. **Exec summary** – 3–7 bullets highlighting impact, risks, and asks.

For each, include:

- A clear title or subject line.
- Top wins, learnings, and shipped items.
- Key risks or blockers.
- Next steps and any explicit asks (decisions, resources, feedback).

## Guidelines

- Maintain a **calm, confident, and honest** tone.
- Emphasize outcomes, not just activity (“we shipped X, which led to Y”).
- Avoid jargon and implementation detail in executive communications.
- Preserve actual numbers and dates; clearly mark estimates as such.
