5. How do you research prospects?
6. What would you do with 5 extra hours/week?
7. Have you explored AI tools yet?
8. What compliance concerns do you have?
```

### Value Propositions
```
TIME SAVINGS:
"Advisors using AI save 8-10 hours/week on admin
tasks, freeing time for client relationships."

CLIENT EXPERIENCE:
"Faster response times, personalized communication,
proactive outreach - clients notice the difference."

COMPETITIVE EDGE:
"Next-gen clients expect tech-forward advisors.
AI-enabled firms win more younger clients."

CAPACITY:
"Serve 20% more clients without sacrificing
service quality or work-life balance."

CONSISTENCY:
"Every client gets the same thorough preparation,
documentation, and follow-through."
```

### Objection Handling
```
"Compliance won't approve AI"
→ "Claude doesn't make investment decisions or
   access client accounts. It's a productivity tool
   like email or Word, just smarter."

"My clients want human advice"
→ "Absolutely - AI handles admin so you have MORE
   time for the human connection that matters."

"I'm not technical"
→ "That's why we handle all setup. You just talk
   to Claude like you'd talk to an assistant."

"What about data security?"
→ "Claude doesn't store conversations. Your client
   data stays in your existing secure systems."

"It's expensive"
→ "If you bill $200/hour and save 8 hours/week,
   that's $80K/year in recaptured capacity."
```
