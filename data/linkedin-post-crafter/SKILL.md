# LinkedIn Post Crafter Skill

## Algorithm Signals (December 2025)

LinkedIn uses a three-step process:
1. **Quality filtering** — Spam vs low vs high quality
2. **Engagement testing** — First hour performance with small sample
3. **Network/relevance ranking** — Personalized based on user behavior

### Key Ranking Signals

| Signal | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Dwell time | Very High | Time spent reading > quick likes |
| Comments | Very High | Thoughtful (10+ words) > generic |
| Saves | High | Strong quality signal |
| Shares | High | Especially direct shares |
| Likes | Medium | Weakest engagement signal |

### The Golden Hour

First 60-90 minutes after posting are critical. High early engagement = broader distribution.

### 2025 Changes

- **Hashtags removed from discovery** — No longer impact reach (still searchable)
- **AI content penalized** — 30% less reach, 55% less engagement
- **Evergreen content** — Posts can resurface for weeks if still getting engagement
- **Topic authority** — Consistent posting on one topic = recognized as expert

## Format Performance (2025 Data)

| Format | Engagement Rate | Best For |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Multi-image/Carousel | 6.60% | Tutorials, frameworks, lists |
| Document (PDF) | 6.10% | Step-by-step, detailed content |
| Video | 3.50% | Personality, behind-scenes |
| Text-only | ~4.2% (avg) | Stories, quick insights |
| Polls | High impressions | Discussion starters, research |

**Key insight**: Carousels get 596% more engagement than text-only posts.

## Carousel Best Practices

### Structure
```
Slide 1: HOOK (compelling cover)
  - Bold statement or question
  - Clean design, readable text
  - Teaser of what's coming

Slides 2-8: VALUE
  - One idea per slide
  - Visual + minimal text
  - Progressive narrative

Slide 9-10: CTA
  - Summary of key points
  - Follow/Save/Comment prompt
```

### Specs
- **Format**: PDF upload (converts to carousel)
- **Size**: 1080x1350 px (portrait) or 1080x1080 (square)
- **Slides**: 3-10 optimal (max 300 allowed)
- **Dwell time**: Carousels get 15-20 seconds vs 8-10 for other formats

### Design Tips
- Large, readable fonts (mobile-first)
- High contrast colors
- Consistent visual style throughout
- Number slides for progress indication

## Hook Strategy

Only first 2-3 lines visible before "see more." Your hook determines everything.

### Hook Formulas

**Curiosity:**
```
"I used to think [common belief]..."
"Here's what nobody tells you about [topic]..."
"The biggest mistake I see in [field]..."
```

**Value-Forward:**
```
"5 ways to [achieve result] (without [common obstacle]):"
"Here's the framework I use for [task]:"
"The simplest way to [accomplish goal]:"
```

**Story:**
```
"Last week, something unexpected happened..."
"I almost gave up on [thing]. Here's what changed..."
"3 years ago, I made a decision that..."
```

**Data/Surprise:**
```
"[Surprising statistic] — here's why it matters."
"I analyzed [X] and found something surprising..."
```

### Formatting Rules
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Plenty of white space
- Line breaks between ideas
- Well-formatted posts get 40% higher engagement

## External Links (The Penalty)

LinkedIn penalizes external links: **25-40% reach reduction**.

### Workarounds

**Option 1: Comment Link**
```
Post without link
↓
Add link in first comment
↓
Reference: "Link in comments 👇"
```

**Option 2: Delayed Edit**
```
Publish without link
↓
Wait for initial engagement (1-2 hours)
↓
Edit to add link
```

**Option 3: Native Content**
```
Instead of linking to newsletter:
- Create carousel summarizing key points
- End with "Full article in newsletter — link in comments"
```

**Best practice**: Focus on native content. Save links for high-value destinations.

## Video Guidelines

Video has grown 36% YoY but underperforms carousels in engagement.

### Specs
- **Length**: Under 90 seconds (retention drops after 60s)
- **Hook**: First 3 seconds critical
- **Subtitles**: Required (most watch on mute)
- **Format**: Native upload (not YouTube links)

### When to Use Video
- Personal stories / behind-the-scenes
- Quick tips that benefit from demonstration
- Thought leadership / opinion pieces
- Building personal connection

## Text Post Templates

### Quick Insight
```
[Bold opening statement]

Here's why:

→ [Point 1]
→ [Point 2]
→ [Point 3]

```

[2-3 short paragraphs telling the story]

The lesson:

[Key takeaway in 1-2 sentences]

[Engagement question]

3. [Point with brief explanation]

```

## Spanish-Language Considerations

For tacosdedatos on LinkedIn:
- Professional tone (more formal than Twitter/Instagram)
- Tech/data content performs well in Spanish (underserved)
- Mix Spanish posts with occasional English for broader reach
- Use industry terms in both languages when appropriate

### Template (Spanish)
```
[Afirmación audaz o pregunta]

Después de [experiencia], aprendí algo importante:

→ [Punto 1]
→ [Punto 2]
→ [Punto 3]

¿Cuál ha sido tu experiencia con [tema]?

#DataScience #Python #VisualizaciónDeDatos
```
