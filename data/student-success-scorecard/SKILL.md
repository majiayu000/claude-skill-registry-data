# Student Success Scorecard Skill

## When to Use
- Setting KPIs for new cohorts or programs.
- Diagnosing retention risks and intervention impact.
- Reporting to leadership, accreditation bodies, or partners.

## Framework
1. **Metric Stack** – inquiry-to-enrollment, onboarding completion, engagement streaks, assignment submissions, completion rate, CSAT/NPS.
2. **Segmentation** – by cohort, modality, persona, geography, instructor, partner.
3. **Risk Signals** – inactivity thresholds, support ticket spikes, sentiment drops.
4. **Intervention Tracker** – log nudges, coaching sessions, community events, results.
5. **Insight Narrative** – highlights, risks, opportunities, recommended actions.

## Templates
- Scorecard dashboard layout (summary + drill-down tabs).
- Risk heatmap template for cohorts/segments.
- Intervention log sheet linking actions to KPI movement.

## Tips
- Automate data pulls from LMS/CRM to reduce manual effort.
- Pair leading indicators (logins, submissions) with lagging outcomes (completion, placement).
- Use with `launch-student-success-program` to define monitoring cadence.
