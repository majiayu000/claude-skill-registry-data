# Form State Management Engine

## Summary
Architect a high-performance form engine handling validation, dirtiness, and dependent fields.

## Key Capabilities
- Track field-level dirtiness.
- Validate asynchronously.
- Handle dependent field logic.

## PhD-Level Challenges
- Optimize re-renders for large forms.
- Manage deeply nested field arrays.
- Synchronize with server state.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implement a 50+ field form.
- Demonstrate isolated re-renders.
- Show validation logic.
