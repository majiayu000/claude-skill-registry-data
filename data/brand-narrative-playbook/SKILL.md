# Brand Narrative Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- Defining or refreshing core messaging pillars.
- Translating positioning into talk tracks for different personas/channels.
- Auditing campaigns for narrative consistency.

## Framework
1. **Audience Grid** – ICP, persona, stage, key pain/aspiration.
2. **Narrative Arc** – context, tension, resolution, proof, call-to-action.
3. **Pillar Mapping** – tie each story beat to brand pillars and supporting evidence.
4. **Proof Library** – customers, metrics, analyst quotes, product demos.
5. **Adaptation Guide** – tone, length, channel tweaks, localization notes.

## Templates
- **Narrative Framework**: See `references/narrative_framework.md` for the arc and audience grid.
- **Messaging hierarchy doc** with prompts.
- **Storyboard slides** for exec, sales, product, and customer marketing audiences.
- **QA checklist** ensuring each asset hits pillar + proof requirements.

## Tips
- Keep a “retire/refresh” log for outdated proof.
- Include “watch-outs” for overused phrases or compliance issues.
- Pair with `define-brand-platform` to auto-populate pillar content.
