# Research Skill

## Purpose

Conduct structured research on topics, technologies, libraries, patterns, or any subject requiring investigation. Produces documented findings with optional issue creation for actionable items.

## When to Use

- Evaluating a new technology or library
- Investigating best practices for a pattern
- Researching solutions to a problem
- Comparing alternatives (frameworks, tools, approaches)
- Understanding external APIs or services
- Preparing for a design decision

## Research Modes

### Quick Research (default)
Fast investigation using available tools and knowledge.

```
/agent-research "FastAPI vs Flask for REST APIs"
→ Quick comparison based on docs and knowledge
```

### Deep Research
Thorough investigation with documentation lookup, code analysis, and structured output.

```
/agent-research deep "Implementing OAuth2 in Python"
→ Detailed findings with examples and recommendations
```

### Comparative Research
Side-by-side evaluation of alternatives.

```
/agent-research compare "pytest vs unittest vs nose2"
→ Feature matrix, pros/cons, recommendation
```

## Research Procedure

### 1. Scope Definition

Before researching, clarify:
- **Topic**: What exactly are we researching?
- **Context**: Why do we need this information?
- **Constraints**: Time budget, depth required, specific questions?
- **Output**: What format is most useful?

If scope is unclear, invoke `agent-ops-interview` for one question at a time.

### 2. Information Gathering

**Sources (in priority order):**

1. **Workspace Context**
   - Existing code patterns
   - Project documentation
   - Constitution constraints
   - Previous research (`.agent/docs/`)

2. **Built-in Knowledge**
   - Language/framework documentation
   - Common patterns and best practices
   - Known tradeoffs and gotchas

3. **External Tools (if available)**
   - Web search via MCP tools
   - Documentation lookup
   - API exploration

4. **Code Analysis**
   - Read relevant source code
   - Analyze existing implementations
   - Check test patterns

### 3. Synthesis

Organize findings into:
- **Summary**: Key takeaways (1-3 sentences)
- **Details**: Structured findings
- **Recommendations**: What to do based on findings
- **Questions**: What remains unclear
- **References**: Sources used

### 4. Output

**Console Output** (default):
```markdown
## Research: {topic}

### Summary
{1-3 sentence summary}

### Findings
{detailed structured findings}

### Recommendations

## Research: {Option A} vs {Option B} vs {Option C}

### Summary
{which is best for our use case and why}

### Feature Matrix

| Feature | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| {feature 1} | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| {feature 2} | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| {feature 3} | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Detailed Comparison

### Problem Investigation

```markdown
## Research: {Problem Description}

### Summary
{root cause and solution}

### Problem Statement
{clear description of the problem}

### Investigation

#### Hypothesis 1: {hypothesis}
- **Evidence for**: ...

| Solution | Effort | Risk | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|------|----------------|
| {solution 1} | Low | Low | ✅ Recommended |
| {solution 2} | Medium | Low | Consider |
| {solution 3} | High | Medium | Only if needed |

### Recommendation
{what to do}
```

## Issue Creation from Research

After research, if actionable items are found:

```
📋 Research complete. Found {N} actionable items:

- [FEAT] Implement caching layer (from performance findings)
- [CHORE] Update dependency to fix vulnerability
- [DOCS] Document new API integration

Create issues for these? [A]ll / [S]elect / [N]one
```

## Integration with Other Skills

- **agent-ops-idea**: Research can be triggered from idea enrichment
- **agent-ops-planning**: Planning can request research for unknowns
- **agent-ops-tasks**: Research findings become backlog items
- **agent-ops-interview**: Used to clarify research scope

## MCP Tool Integration (Optional)

If MCP tools are available, research can use:

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `web_search` | Search for documentation, tutorials, comparisons |
| `fetch_url` | Retrieve specific documentation pages |
| `brave_search` | Alternative web search |

**Without MCP tools**: Research uses built-in knowledge and workspace analysis only.

## Research Confidence

Rate research confidence based on sources:

| Confidence | Sources |
|------------|---------|
| **High** | Official docs + code analysis + personal experience |
| **Medium** | Official docs OR established best practices |
| **Low** | Community opinions, limited sources, outdated info |

Always state confidence level in recommendations.

## Examples

### Quick Research
```
User: /agent-research "Python dataclasses vs pydantic for config"

Agent:
## Research: dataclasses vs pydantic for Configuration

### Summary
Use **pydantic** for configuration with validation, **dataclasses** for simple data containers.

### Comparison

| Feature | dataclasses | pydantic |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Validation | ❌ Manual | ✅ Built-in |
| Type coercion | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| JSON parsing | ⚠️ Extra code | ✅ Built-in |
| Performance | ✅ Faster | ⚠️ Overhead |
| Dependencies | ✅ stdlib | ❌ External |

### Recommendation
For configuration files: **pydantic** (validation is critical for config)
For internal data: **dataclasses** (simpler, faster)

Confidence: **High** (based on official docs and common practice)
```
