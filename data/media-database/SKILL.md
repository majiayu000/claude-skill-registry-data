# Media Database Operations Skill

## When to Use
- Building pitch lists for launches or thought-leadership campaigns.
- Cleaning and deduping media contacts after staffing changes.
- Tracking interactions, responses, and embargo agreements.

## Framework
1. **Research** – pull inputs from tools (MuckRack, Propel, manual research) covering recent articles, beats, social handles.
2. **Segmentation** – categorize by beat, outlet tier, region, relationship status, preferred format.
3. **Compliance** – store consent notes, GDPR considerations, embargo agreements, NDAs.
4. **Maintenance** – monthly hygiene (bounces, role changes, new publications).
5. **Insights** – log interactions to inform future pitches and avoid over-contacting.

## Templates
- Media list CSV schema.
- Outreach CRM board (status, last touch, next step).
- Consent/embargo tracking sheet.

## Tips
- Keep tags consistent so filters work across launches.
- Track social handles for quick DM coordination during crises.
- Note journalist preferences (format, lead time, exclusives) to personalize outreach.
