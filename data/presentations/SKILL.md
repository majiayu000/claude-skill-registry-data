# Presentation Animation

Apply Disney's 12 animation principles to Keynote, PowerPoint, Google Slides, and presentation software.

## Quick Reference

| Principle | Presentation Implementation |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| Squash & Stretch | Bounce emphasis, elastic scaling |
| Anticipation | Build sequences, pre-reveal fades |
| Staging | Focal point management, dimming |
| Straight Ahead / Pose to Pose | Morph vs discrete transitions |
| Follow Through / Overlapping | Staggered builds, delayed elements |
| Slow In / Slow Out | Ease animations, avoid linear |
| Arc | Motion paths, curved entrances |
| Secondary Action | Supporting graphics follow primary |
| Timing | Builds 0.3-0.5s, transitions 0.5-0.8s |
| Exaggeration | Emphasis effects, attention draws |
| Solid Drawing | Consistent alignment, visual balance |
| Appeal | Professional polish, purposeful motion |

## Principle Applications

**Squash & Stretch**: Use bounce effect sparingly for playful emphasis. Scale animations should feel elastic not mechanical. Key numbers can "pop" with slight overshoot.

**Anticipation**: Fade out previous content before new appears. Slight pause after slide transition before builds begin. Dim existing elements before highlighting new ones.

**Staging**: One focal point per moment. Dim completed content to 30-50% opacity. Use motion to direct eye path. Build complex diagrams piece by piece.

**Straight Ahead vs Pose to Pose**: Morph transitions (Keynote Magic Move, PowerPoint Morph) create fluid straight-ahead motion. Standard builds are pose to pose. Use morph for transformation stories.

**Follow Through & Overlapping**: Build related items with 0.1-0.2s delays. Supporting text follows primary graphic. Bullet points stagger naturally. Don't animate everything simultaneously.

**Slow In / Slow Out**: Always use ease-in-out or ease-out. Never linear—looks robotic. Keynote: "Ease In & Out". PowerPoint: use custom motion paths with curve handles.

**Arc**: Motion paths should curve naturally. Elements entering from sides arc inward. Exit animations arc toward edges. Straight lines feel mechanical.

**Secondary Action**: Icons animate alongside text reveals. Arrows appear as relationships are explained. Background subtle shifts support primary content.

**Timing**: Text builds: 0.3-0.5s. Graphic reveals: 0.4-0.6s. Slide transitions: 0.5-0.8s. Complex sequences: 0.2-0.3s between elements. Match pacing to speaking rhythm.

**Exaggeration**: Use scale emphasis for key points. Pulse effect for critical numbers. Shake for contrast/disagreement. Reserve exaggeration for truly important moments.

**Solid Drawing**: Maintain grid alignment during motion. Consistent transform origins. Elements should feel anchored to the slide structure.

**Appeal**: Purposeful animation builds credibility. Excessive motion distracts and annoys. Every animation should serve communication.

## Software Patterns

### Keynote
```
Best builds: Dissolve, Move In, Scale
Magic Move: Most powerful transition—objects morph between slides
Timing: Use "Build Order" panel for precise sequencing
Tip: Group objects that should animate together
```

### PowerPoint
```
Best entrances: Fade, Fly In (with custom path)
Morph transition: Objects with same name transform
Timing: Animation Pane for sequencing
Tip: Use "With Previous" + delay for stagger
```

### Google Slides
```
Limited but functional: Fade, Fly in
No morphing: Use Fade for cleanest transitions
Timing: Less control—keep animations simple
Tip: Fewer, better animations beat many poor ones
```

## Build Sequences

| Content Type | Animation | Duration | Delay |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Title | Fade + Scale | 0.5s | 0s |
| Subtitle | Fade | 0.4s | 0.2s |
| Bullet 1 | Fade + Move | 0.3s | 0.3s |
| Bullet 2+ | Fade + Move | 0.3s | +0.15s each |
| Image | Scale from center | 0.5s | varies |
| Chart | Custom/Wipe | 0.6s | varies |

## Presenter Tips

1. Animate on click, not automatically—control your pacing
2. Practice with animations—know what comes next
3. Less is more—animation should clarify, not decorate
4. Test on presentation display—timing feels different at scale
5. Have a backup with no animations for technical issues
