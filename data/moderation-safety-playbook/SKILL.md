# Moderation & Safety Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- Launching or scaling moderated forums, chats, or live events.
- Training moderators, ambassadors, or vendors on policies.
- Handling escalations, abuse reports, or crisis communications.

## Framework
1. **Policy Matrix** – code of conduct, content types, enforcement tiers, regional considerations.
2. **Workflow** – intake → triage → resolution → follow-up, with SLAs and ownership.
3. **Tooling** – moderation dashboards, keyword lists, automation rules, reporting forms.
4. **Escalation Ladder** – when to engage legal, security, PR, or executive sponsors.
5. **Post-Incident Review** – retrospectives, comms templates, improvements.

## Templates
- Moderator guide with sample responses, tone guidance, and decision trees.
- Incident log + scoreboard for tracking volume, severity, MTTR.
- Crisis comms outline for public/partner updates.

## Tips
- Publish a transparent policy summary so members know expectations.
- Rotate moderators to reduce burnout; provide mental health resources.
- Pair with `launch-community-activation-series` for real-time event safety coverage.
