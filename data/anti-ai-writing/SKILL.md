# Anti-AI Writing Engine

Transform any content into authentic, human-sounding prose by eliminating AI patterns and applying proven writing fundamentals.

## Purpose

This skill serves as the core humanization engine for all written content. It detects and eliminates patterns that signal AI involvement while teaching the principles of natural, engaging writing.

**Core Philosophy:** The best writing is invisible. Readers should feel like they're reading a real person's thoughts - not processed, filtered, or generated content.

## When to Use This Skill

- Reviewing and humanizing AI-generated drafts
- Writing content that must not appear AI-assisted
- Editing any prose for authenticity and impact
- Training yourself to avoid AI-like patterns
- Quality-checking content before publication

**Pairs well with:** Voice style skills (voice-pirate-wires, voice-analytical, etc.) for writing in a specific author's style.

---

## Universal Writing Fundamentals

Master these principles first, then layer on specific style choices.

### 1. Energy Transfer

**The best writing is a transfer of energy from writer to reader.**

- Write conversations, not speeches
- Speak WITH your audience, not AT them
- Remove corporate jargon, academic language, and buzzwords

**Example:**
- ❌ "The implementation of our innovative frameworks has demonstrated significant positive outcomes in terms of engagement metrics."
- ✅ "Our new approach works. People are paying attention."

The second version transfers energy. Readers feel conviction, not formality.

### 2. Conciseness is King

**Every word must earn its place.**

**Process:**
1. Write your first draft freely
2. Read it aloud
3. Delete anything that:
   - Repeats an idea already stated
   - Softens your main point
   - Sounds formal instead of conversational
   - Takes more words than necessary

**Example:**
- ❌ "Our approach incorporates multiple methodologies designed to accommodate diverse requirements and development patterns."
- ✅ "We adapt to how you work."

### 3. The SUCKS Framework

Before writing anything, answer these questions:

**S - Specific**
- Write for ONE person, not a crowd
- Know their struggles, goals, language
- If you write for everyone, you write for no one

**U - Unique & Useful**
- Does this change how your reader thinks, feels, or acts?
- Unique: they haven't seen this perspective before
- Useful: they can actually apply this

**C - Clear, Curious, Conversational**
- Clear: Main idea is unmissable
- Curious: Questions that make readers think
- Conversational: Reads like talking to a friend

**K - Kept Simple & Structured**
- Simple ideas, simple words
- Clear beginning, middle, end

**S - Sticky**
- Memorable phrases they'll repeat
- Ideas that lodge in memory

**Application checklist:**
- [ ] Who is my ONE reader?
- [ ] What will they think, feel, or do differently?
- [ ] Could a 12-year-old understand the main point?
- [ ] Does this flow like a conversation?

### 4. Be Undeniable

**Transform vague claims into concrete specifics.**

- ❌ "How to boost your results by at least 87% in just one month."
- ✅ "This year, I helped 13 clients boost their results by 87%-256% in just one month. Here's how:"

**Pattern:** Replace vague language with data, examples, specifics, or personal experience.

### 5. Craft Sticky Sentences

Use these techniques to create memorable statements:

**Alliteration** - Same starting sounds
- "Specificity is the secret"
- "The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed"

**Symmetry** - Parallel structure
- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations."

**Contrast** - Opposing ideas
- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere."
- "Be clear, not clever. Concise, not complex."

**Rhyme** - Similar ending sounds
- "Tell a story or lose your glory"

**Rhythm** - Pleasing cadence
- "When you can't wait to share it, they can't help but read it"

**For maximum stickiness, combine techniques:**
- "Anger prepares us to fight. Fear prepares us to flee." (Symmetry + Alliteration)

See `references/sticky-sentences.md` for expanded examples.

## Forbidden Patterns (AI Tells)

These patterns consistently signal AI involvement. Eliminate them aggressively.

### The Correlative Construction (Most Common AI Tell)

This is the #1 pattern to avoid:

- ❌ "X aren't just Y - they're Z"
- ❌ "X isn't just about Y, it's about Z"
- ❌ "Teachers aren't just instructors - they're mentors"

**Why it's bad:** This is the default structure AI models produce. Every AI writing sample uses this.

**Better alternatives:**
- ✅ "Teachers mentor students"
- ✅ "X accomplishes both Y and Z"
- ✅ State the point directly

### Forbidden Constructions

- ❌ "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- ❌ "The truth is..." / "The reality is..."
- ❌ "Let that sink in"
- ❌ "Now more than ever..."

**Better:** State your point directly without setup.

### Forbidden Rhetorical Flourishes

- ❌ "The best part? ..."
- ❌ "The secret? ..."
- ❌ "Sounds impossible? It's not."
- ❌ "What if I told you..."
- ❌ "Here's the thing..."
- ❌ "Let's be honest..."
- ❌ "At the end of the day..."

### Forbidden Staccato Phrasing

Do not use faux-dramatic sentence fragments:
- ❌ "No fluff. No filler. Just results."
- ❌ "Big ideas. Small words. Maximum impact."
- ❌ "Simple. Clear. Effective."
- ❌ "Stop guessing. Start winning."

### Forbidden Openers

- ❌ "In the ever-evolving world of..."
- ❌ "In today's fast-paced..."
- ❌ "Gone are the days when..."
- ❌ "This underscores..."
- ❌ "In an era where..."

### Formatting Restrictions

- Do not use boldface for emphasis in body text
- Do not use emojis unless explicitly requested
- Do not add summaries like "In conclusion" or "In summary"
- Do not rely on bullet points unless explicitly asked

### Dash Usage

Use regular hyphens with spaces for parenthetical breaks - like this - not em dashes (—) or en dashes (–).

- ✅ "Education is changing - and parents are noticing"
- ❌ "Education is changing—and parents are noticing"

---

## Anti-AI Pattern Detection

Beyond forbidden syntax, these patterns consistently signal AI involvement:

### 1. Overuse of "Just"

**Problem:** AI uses "just" constantly as a softener.

- ❌ "We just need to understand that it's just about learning, and we just have to focus on what matters."
- ✅ "It's about learning. Focus on what matters."

**When "just" is acceptable:** "just one question," "just in case," "just started"

**When to remove it:** Middle of sentences as a softener, more than once per paragraph

### 2. Overuse of "Actually"

**Problem:** AI uses "actually" to sound like it's adding nuance.

- ❌ "It's actually about teaching, but actually about community, and students actually need both."
- ✅ "It's about teaching. It's also about community. Students need both."

**When acceptable:** Correcting a previous misunderstanding

**Limit:** Once per 500 words maximum

### 3. Hedging Language

AI loves hedge words because they make uncertain claims safer. But they make writing weak.

**Common hedges to eliminate:**
- ❌ "This might help you" → ✅ "This will help you"
- ❌ "Some people say..." → ✅ "I've found that..."
- ❌ "It could be argued that..." → ✅ "It's true that..."
- ❌ "Perhaps we should consider..." → ✅ "We should..."
- ❌ "One could say..." → ✅ "This is true because..."

**Test:** If you find "might," "could," "perhaps," "possibly," "maybe," "somewhat," or "it seems like," ask: Do I actually believe this? If yes, remove the hedge.

### 4. Passive Voice

**Problem:** AI defaults to passive voice because it's safer.

- ❌ "It was determined that improvements were needed"
- ✅ "We need to improve"

- ❌ "It has been shown that users benefit from..."
- ✅ "Users benefit from..."

**Test:** If you can't identify who's doing the action, it's passive. Rewrite with a subject.

### 5. Corporate Jargon

These signal over-processing:

- ❌ "Leveraging synergies across stakeholder ecosystems"
- ✅ "Getting different people talking to each other"

- ❌ "Optimize engagement metrics"
- ✅ "Get people paying attention"

**Test:** Would you say this to a friend? If not, rewrite it plainly.

### 6. Vague Language

AI tends toward vagueness because it's safer. Vague writing is weak writing.

- ❌ "Our users improve" → ✅ "Users improve by 40% in 6 months"
- ❌ "Many people think..." → ✅ "A survey found that 73% of users..."
- ❌ "Significant improvements" → ✅ "Improvements of 23-47%"

**Test:** Can you back it up with a specific number, example, or name?

### 7. Too Many Transition Words

AI overuses transitions trying to seem sophisticated:

- ❌ "Furthermore, it is important to note that, in addition to this, moreover..."
- ✅ Strong structure needs fewer transitions

**Limit transitions to:** but, and, so, then, because

### 8. Overcomplicated Sentence Structure

**AI loves long, complex sentences trying to sound smart.**

- ❌ "The multifaceted nature of contemporary paradigms, which encompasses diverse modalities and approaches, necessitates a comprehensive reevaluation of traditional methodologies."
- ✅ "Things have changed. We need to rethink our approach."

## The Humanization Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Your Source

- What's the core insight or story?
- What's the emotional arc?
- What's the most important takeaway?

**Ask yourself:**
- [ ] What's being said that no one else is saying?
- [ ] What will readers think, feel, or do differently?
- [ ] What's the 30-second version?

### Step 2: Apply the SUCKS Framework

- [ ] Who is my ONE reader?
- [ ] Is this unique and useful to them?
- [ ] Can I make it clear, curious, and conversational?
- [ ] How do I keep it simple and structured?
- [ ] What will stick with them?

### Step 3: Write or Edit the Draft

If writing fresh:
1. Write freely without self-editing
2. Get the ideas down first
3. Polish in subsequent passes

If editing AI output:
1. Read the entire draft
2. Identify the core message
3. Rewrite rather than patch

### Step 4: Apply Sticky Sentences

Identify 2-3 most important statements and strengthen them:
- Add alliteration, symmetry, contrast, or rhythm
- Make them quotable
- Make them memorable

### Step 5: Eliminate AI Tells (Critical)

Go through systematically and remove:
- [ ] Correlative constructions ("X aren't just Y, they're Z")
- [ ] Overuse of "just" and "actually"
- [ ] Hedge words (might, could, perhaps, seems)
- [ ] Passive voice
- [ ] Corporate jargon
- [ ] Vague language (replace with specifics)
- [ ] Forbidden patterns ("Let that sink in," etc.)
- [ ] Too many transitions
- [ ] Overcomplicated sentences

**Test for each sentence:** Would this sentence appear in a ChatGPT output? If yes, rewrite it.

### Step 6: Read Aloud & Quality Check

Read your entire piece aloud:
- [ ] Does it sound like a real person talking?
- [ ] Does energy transfer (not feel formal)?
- [ ] Is every sentence earning its place?
- [ ] Do important ideas have sticky phrasing?
- [ ] Are there obvious AI tells remaining?

**If you answer "no" to any checkbox, fix it before publishing.**

## Quick Reference Checklists

### The "Would a Human Write This?" Test

For each paragraph, ask:
1. Does it sound like how I actually talk?
2. Is there unnecessary formality?
3. Are there words I'd never use in conversation?
4. Does it take the long way to make a point?
5. Does it hedge when I'm actually certain?

### The AI Tell Scan

Before publishing, scan for:
- [ ] "It's not X, it's Y" constructions
- [ ] "Just" appearing more than once
- [ ] "Actually" as sentence filler
- [ ] Passive voice ("was determined," "has been shown")
- [ ] Hedge words ("might," "could," "perhaps")
- [ ] Corporate speak ("leverage," "optimize," "ecosystem")
- [ ] Vague claims without specifics
- [ ] Overused transitions ("furthermore," "moreover")
- [ ] Complex sentences that could be simple
- [ ] Rhetorical flourishes ("The best part?")

### Elements of Effective Content

Include in your writing:
1. **Immediate attention** - First sentence hooks
2. **Specific numbers** - "1.5 million" not "many"
3. **Pattern interrupts** - Surprise the reader
4. **Direct problem-addressing** - Name the struggle
5. **Confidence** - Eliminate hedge words
6. **Concrete benefits** - "Double output in 30 days" not "boost productivity"
7. **Powerful questions** - Make readers think
8. **Warnings/stakes** - Create urgency
