# YouTube Script Writer (Ed Lawrence Method + Tournament Selection)

Write scripts that optimize for viewer satisfaction scores through tournament-tested hooks, tension management, and cognitive load optimization.

## Core Workflow

The script writing process follows these steps:

1. **Content Analysis** - Understand the video concept and goal
2. **Hook Tournament** - Generate and test 6 hook variations (6 -> 3 -> 1)
3. **Structure Planning** - Map tension curve and key moments
4. **Script Development** - Write full script with optimized flow
5. **Read-Aloud Validation** - Test cognitive load and rhythm

---

## Core Principle: Scripts Are Non-Negotiable

**Why you cannot "wing it":**
- You cannot simultaneously present AND optimize each sentence
- Repetition doesn't add clarity after understanding - it creates confusion
- Viewers' brains have maximum capacity
- Until you have a decade of refined explanations, you need scripts

**The difference:**

**Unscripted disaster (127 words):**
"If your thumbnail and title don't match the content of your video, people will leave. So, if they click on a video expecting one thing and then they get something else, they feel kind of misled and they'll drop off. And if they feel misled, that means the algorithm won't push you because it thinks people don't like it. And if the algorithm doesn't push you, you won't get views. So, the big takeaway here is you really need to make sure your thumbnail and title match the content. Otherwise, people won't stick around and if they don't stick around, the algorithm won't push your video and then you won't get any views."

**Scripted version (28 words):**
"If your thumbnail and title don't match the content of your video, people will leave and you won't grow as a result. That's why I always plan around expectations first."

---

## Step 1: Content Analysis

Before writing, establish:

**Video Concept:**
- Title
- Thumbnail
- Angle
- Goal (email/sales/views)

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Main framework/system (give it a NAME)
- 3-5 core points
- Supporting stories/examples
- Visual metaphors needed

**Proof Elements:**
- Numbers to share
- Screen recordings to include
- Client examples
- Your credibility markers

Document these before proceeding to hooks.

---

## Step 2: Hook Tournament (6 -> 3 -> 1)

The first 30-60 seconds determine video success. Generate 6 hook variations using different pattern interrupts, then use tournament to find the strongest.

### The 5-Line Hook Formula

Every hook must have:

**Line 1: Pattern Interrupt** - Stop scrolling
**Line 2: Credibility** - Why listen to you
**Line 3: Empathy** - You understand their pain
**Line 4: Promise** - What they'll learn
**Line 5: Teaser** - Reason to stay til end

### Generate 6 Hook Variations

Use different pattern interrupt types:

**Hook 1: Controversial Statement**
Example: "Most brands are completely invisible to ChatGPT. Yours probably is too."

**Hook 2: Surprising Statistic**
Example: "ChatGPT influences 40% of purchase decisions now. Is your brand being recommended?"

**Hook 3: Provocative Question**
Example: "What if I told you ChatGPT convinced me to buy a Porsche instead of a BMW?"

**Hook 4: Specific Result**
Example: "This brand went from zero mentions to being ChatGPT's top recommendation in 30 days."

**Hook 5: Relatable Frustration**
Example: "You've optimized for Google. You've done SEO. But AI doesn't even know you exist."

**Hook 6: Contrarian Take**
Example: "SEO is dead. Here's what's replacing it."

For each hook, write out all 5 lines following the formula.

### Round 1: Hook Elimination (6 -> 3)

Compare hooks pairwise on:

**Pattern Interrupt Strength (40%):** Stops scrolling immediately?
**Credibility Fit (25%):** Leverages YOUR specific backstory?
**Clarity (20%):** Immediately understandable?
**Positioning Alignment (15%):** Fits channel's enemy/belief?

For each matchup:
- Winner advances
- Document why loser was weaker
- Note: Could loser work for different video?

Advance 3 winners.

### Round 2: Semi-Finals (3 -> 1)

Compare remaining hooks on:

**Goal Alignment (35%):** Best serves video's purpose?
**Curiosity Gap (30%):** Creates strongest "need to know"?
**Natural Flow (20%):** Sets up rest of content smoothly?
**Authentic Voice (15%):** Sounds like YOU?

Select final hook and document reasoning.

## Step 3: Tension Management Structure

Ed's #1 rule: **Manage tension throughout the video**

### What is Tension?
The gap between what viewers know and what they want to know.

### The Tension Curve:

```
Hook (HIGH tension)
| Partial resolution
Create new tension
| Partial resolution
Build to climax
| FULL resolution (payoff)
End (LOW tension)
```

### Map Your Tension Points

**For 8-12 minute video:**

**0:00-1:00** - Hook (create main tension)
**1:00-2:00** - Setup (deepen tension, tease solution)
**2:00-8:00** - Main content (tension -> partial resolution -> new tension loop)
**8:00-10:00** - Payoff (resolve main tension)
**10:00-11:00** - CTA (next action)

### Tension Creation Techniques:

**Open Loops:**
- "There are 3 mistakes. The first is obvious, but the third? Nobody talks about it."
- "Before I show you the framework, you need to understand why it works..."

**Micro-Cliffhangers:**
- "And this is where it gets interesting..."
- "The second step is simple. The third step? That's where people fail..."

**Pattern Breaks:**
- "You'd think X. But here's what actually happened..."
- "Everyone does it this way. I did the opposite..."

---

## Step 4: Script Structure Template

### Part 1: Hook (30-60 seconds)
[Use winning hook from tournament]

**Line 1:** [Pattern interrupt]
**Line 2:** [Credibility]
**Line 3:** [Empathy]
**Line 4:** [Promise]
**Line 5:** [Teaser]

### Part 2: Setup (1-2 minutes)

**Establish problem deeply:**
- Why it matters
- What's at stake
- Why they haven't solved it

**Create tension about solution:**
- "There's a reason this works..."
- "But first, you need to understand..."
- Open loop to payoff later

**Example:**
"Let me show you why 60% of brands are invisible to ChatGPT. It's not what you think. And once you see it, you'll never look at your marketing the same way."

### Part 3: Main Content (5-10 minutes)

**For "Framework" Videos:**

**Point 1 + Visual Metaphor**
- Introduce with story
- Explain using named framework
- Show visual metaphor
- Mini-tension: "But here's the catch..."
- Partial resolution

**Point 2 + Visual Metaphor**
- Connect to Point 1
- New story/example
- Visual metaphor
- Mini-tension: "This next part surprises people..."
- Partial resolution

**Point 3 + Visual Metaphor**
- Build to climax
- Ultimate insight
- Visual metaphor
- Create final tension before payoff

**Rules for main content:**
- Wrap every point in story OR framework OR metaphor OR visual
- Strip away non-essentials (Ed: "What could I delete and they'd still get value?")
- One point per breath, then pause
- Make viewers feel SMART (not like idiots)

**For "Case Study" Videos:**

**Before State:**
- The problem (specific numbers)
- What they tried before
- Why it wasn't working

**The Intervention:**
- What changed
- The system/process
- Key decisions made

**After State:**
- Results (specific numbers)
- Timeline
- What surprised you

**For "Comparison" Videos:**

**Option A Test:**
- Hypothesis
- Testing process
- Results

**Option B Test:**
- Hypothesis
- Testing process
- Results

**Head-to-Head Analysis:**
- Which won
- Why
- What you learned

### Part 4: Payoff (1-2 minutes)

**Resolve the main tension:**
- Answer the big question
- Deliver on promise from hook
- Share the "aha" moment
- Circle back to teaser from Line 5

**Example:**
"Remember I said the third mistake is what nobody talks about? Here it is: [reveal]. This is what cost me 6 months. Don't make the same mistake."

### Part 5: CTA (30-60 seconds)

**One-sentence recap:**
"So if you remember one thing: [main takeaway]"

**Tell them what to do next (VIDEO-TO-VIDEO CTA):**
- "Watch this video next where I show you..."
- Point to related video on screen
- End screen card to next video in sequence

**End with forward momentum:**
"I'll see you in the next one."

NOT: "Thanks for watching, like and subscribe" (weak ending)

---

## Step 5: Cognitive Load Optimization

### Ed's Strip-Down Rule

Ask these questions for every section:

**What are the quickest wins here?**
- Focus on highest-impact points
- Save deep dives for advanced videos

**What could I delete and they'd still get amazing results?**
- If it's not essential, cut it
- Viewers should feel "I can do this"

**Am I making them feel smart or like an idiot?**
- Simplify complex -> make them feel smart
- Over-explain simple -> make them feel dumb

### Wrap Every Point Into:

**1. A Story (personal experience)**
"When I first tried this, I made the same mistake. I thought..."

**2. A Framework (with a NAME)**
"I call this the AEO Visibility Framework. Think of it like a funnel..."

**3. A Metaphor (relatable comparison)**
"It's like shouting in a room where everyone's wearing noise-canceling headphones."

**4. A Visual (show, don't just tell)**
"Let me show you exactly what this looks like on screen..."

### Advanced Writing Techniques

**The "Because" Frame:**
Never state without explaining why:
- X "You need to optimize for ChatGPT"
- O "You need to optimize for ChatGPT because AI now influences 40% of purchase decisions"

**The "That's Why" Connector:**
Link to their goals:
- X "Use structured data"
- O "Use structured data. That's why ChatGPT will cite you as a source"

**The "Don't Make Them Guess" Rule:**
If viewers have to work to understand, they leave:
- State the obvious
- Define your terms
- Connect the dots explicitly

**The "One Point Per Breath" Rule:**
One idea per sentence. Then pause. Let it sink in.

---

## Step 6: Read-Aloud Validation

Before finalizing script:

### Read entire script out loud

**Mark anywhere you:**
- Stumble over words
- Run out of breath
- Lose the thread
- Use too much jargon
- Repeat yourself

### Cognitive Load Check:

**For each section, verify:**
- [ ] Only essential information included
- [ ] Wrapped in story/framework/metaphor/visual
- [ ] Viewers feel smart, not confused
- [ ] Clear value, not overwhelming

### Tension Check:

**Review flow:**
- [ ] Hook creates strong opening tension
- [ ] Each section has mini tension -> resolution
- [ ] Build to climax before payoff
- [ ] Payoff resolves main tension from hook

### Positioning Check:

**Verify alignment:**
- [ ] Language matches avatar
- [ ] Credibility markers used
- [ ] Enemy mentioned/positioned against
- [ ] Belief reinforced
- [ ] Stays in owned space

## Common Script Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Starting with "In this video"
X "In this video, I'm going to show you..."
O "Most brands are invisible to ChatGPT. Here's why."

### Mistake 2: Over-explaining
X Repeating the same point 3 different ways
O State it once, clearly, with a visual

### Mistake 3: No Tension Management
X Answering everything in the first 2 minutes
O Building curiosity that pays off at the end

### Mistake 4: Generic Language
X "There are some tips and tricks..."
O "The third mistake cost me 6 months..."

### Mistake 5: No Structure
X Rambling from point to point
O Clear framework with named visual representation

### Mistake 6: Weak CTA
X "Thanks for watching, don't forget to subscribe"
O "Watch this video next where I show you [specific outcome]. I'll see you there."

## AEO-Specific Script Elements

When writing AEO content, always include:

### Credibility Stack
- Scaled hair clinic $0 -> $5M with Meta ads
- Scaled same clinic $5M -> $10M with AI chatbots
- Now pioneering AEO (the next frontier)

### The Origin Story (Use in hooks/setup)
"I was on my second BMW. Going to buy another one. Asked ChatGPT for advice. It convinced me to buy a Porsche Boxster instead. That's when I realized - if AI can change MY buying decision, what's it doing to my clients' businesses?"

### Key Proof Points
- FueGenix case study (0 to 15M euros)
- Real audit screenshots
- Before/after ChatGPT mentions

### CTA Pattern (Video-to-Video)
Never send to external links. Always point to next video:
- "Watch this video next where I audit [brand]"
- "In the next video, I'll show you step by step..."
- End screen pointing to related content

---

## Remember:

- **Scripts are non-negotiable** - You cannot optimize in real-time
- **Hook tournament finds the winner** - Don't skip comparison rounds
- **Tension keeps people watching** - Manage it throughout
- **Visual metaphors make things stick** - Name your frameworks
- **One point per breath** - Let ideas sink in
- **Make viewers feel smart** - Strip away non-essentials
- **CTA to next video** - Keep them on platform

**Ed's final rule:** "The more you rush it, the harder it gets, the more pressure you get on yourself and the worse your content is."

Take time to script. Test multiple hooks. This is where you control the algorithm.
