# Revenue Health Dashboard Skill

## When to Use
- Summarizing bookings, pipeline, retention, and efficiency metrics in one place.
- Creating weekly/monthly revenue review packs with consistent layout.
- Highlighting guardrail breaches and ownership for remediation.

## Framework
1. **KPI Stack** – bookings, pipeline coverage, win rate, retention/NRR, CAC/payback.
2. **Segmentation Layer** – tabs for region, segment, product, channel.
3. **Guardrail Banner** – visual cues for breached vs healthy thresholds.
4. **Insight Tiles** – annotate root cause, owner, and next action per issue.
5. **Drill Links** – tie charts to deeper dashboards or command outputs.

## Templates
- Executive summary slide with KPI dials + traffic lights.
- Detail view for pipeline vs target, retention cohorts, and efficiency metrics.
- Action tracker table embedded in the dashboard.

## Tips
- Keep traffic-light rules aligned with `guardrail-scorecard` to avoid confusion.
- Embed command links (monitor, inspect, build) so reviewers can dive deeper.
- Snapshot dashboards before/after remediation to track improvement.
