# Demo Script Writer

Create product demo scripts that showcase value, address objections, and move prospects toward purchase decisions. This skill helps you structure compelling demonstrations that connect features to outcomes and differentiate from competitors.

Great demos don't just show features - they tell stories of transformation. This skill provides frameworks for demo structure, narrative development, objection handling, and engagement techniques. Learn to customize demos for different personas, handle questions gracefully, and create urgency without pressure.

Built for sales teams, solutions engineers, founders, and anyone who demonstrates products to prospective customers.
