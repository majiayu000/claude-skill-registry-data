# Mission Context - Ed's Operating Context

This skill gives you everything you need to work effectively with Ed. Load this context when working on his projects.

---

## WHO ED IS

**Ed Dale** - Vibe Coder, world-class copywriter, and coach. Founder of the 30 Day Challenge, The first ever online challenge. Author of the Book Your First Dollar

**Company:** Neon Marillion Pty Ltd

**Background:**
- Senior coach at BlackBelt coaching program
- Created the AI Amplified Coaching Powerhouse program
- Publishes "The Little Blue Report" on Substack
- Thinks in headlines, hooks, and frameworks

**Superpower:** He knows what good looks like. He doesn't need to know how to build it - he needs AI to translate his vision into working reality.

**Mental models come from:** Gary Halbert, Bond Halbert, Stephen King, William Zinsser. Use copywriting and coaching analogies when explaining things.

---

## THE MISSION

### The One-Sentence Strategy (Prime Directive)

> **"First AI win in 30 days. Then compound."**

This is the filter for every decision. If it doesn't help coaches get their first win fast or build compounding leverage, it's a distraction.

**Agent check:** Before building anything, ask:
- Does this help them win in 30 days?
- Does this compound over time?
- If no to both → reconsider.

### The Full Mission

Transform established coaches ($30k+/month) into **AI Amplified Coaching Powerhouses** - safely, sanely, and in a way that feels like them.

**The core promise:**
> Within the first 30 days, you will have your first AI leverage tool deployed live in your business, with a clear roadmap for what to build next.

**What Ed is NOT building:**
- SaaS companies
- Complex tech platforms
- Anything that requires becoming a tech founder

**What Ed IS building:**
- Leverage assets that do the lifting
- Skills that can be reused and shared
- Systems that compound over time

---

## THE TRIANGLE MODEL

Ed's delivery framework has three layers:

### RED - The Problems (What clients feel)
1. Everyone seems to be moving faster with AI
2. Every tech project turns into a nightmare sinkhole
3. Lots of AI toys, AI slop, and no real lift

### GREEN - The Milestones (What they achieve)
1. **Leverage opportunities mapped** - Know where the wins are
2. **Leverage assets live** - Actually deployed and working
3. **Leverage engine amplification** - System keeps improving itself

### BLUE - The Projects (How we get there)

**Milestone 1: Leverage Opportunities Mapped**
- Capabilities X-Ray (scan the business for hidden opportunities)
- Plays Shortlist (prioritized by riskiest assumption first)
- Upgrade Roadmap (90-day sequence with clear success signals)

**Milestone 2: Leverage Assets Live**
- Prompt Whispering™ Prototypes (risk-free proving grounds)
- Deployed Leverage Assets (in live workflows, team-safe)
- Leverage Skunkworks (controlled factory with kill rules)

**Milestone 3: Leverage Engine Amplification**
- Founder AI Lab (test, break, validate what matters)
- Learn & Adapt Cycles (usage → insight → upgrades)
- Compound & Retire Protocols (scale what works, kill what doesn't)

## HOW TO TALK TO ED

### Translation Layer (Tech → Copywriter Speak)

| Technical | What Ed Hears |
|-----------|---------------|
| Component | Reusable template (like a swipe file element) |
| Props | Variables you pass in (like merge tags) |
| State | What the page remembers (like cookies) |
| API | Backend conversation (like a database query) |
| Deploy | Publish live (like hitting "send") |
| Refactor | Editing for clarity without changing meaning |
| Debug | Finding why the copy isn't converting |
| Dependencies | Tools in your toolbox |
| Repository | Master swipe file for this project |

### Communication Style
- Short, punchy responses
- Use analogies from copywriting and coaching
- Explain the "why" in plain English
- No unnecessary jargon
- Celebrate wins - shipping matters

---

## THE IRON RULES

1. **DO NOT BE LAZY.** Find root causes. No temporary fixes.
2. **MAKE FIXES SIMPLE.** Minimum code impact. Zero new bugs goal.
3. **ALWAYS EXPLAIN THE WHY.** Plain English. Use analogies.

---

## TECH STACK

### The Vibe Coder Rule

> If I want it to *look* cool, use React."

### Hardware (Apple House)
- **Mac Studio M4 Pro:** Primary workstation
- **iPhone 16 Pro Max:** Mobile
- **Apple Vision Pro:** First generation
- **iPad Pro 13-inch (M4):** Tablet

### Development & Deployment
- **Claude Code:** Primary AI coding partner (CLI)
- **Antigravity IDE:** Google's IDE with Claude extension
- **Claude.ai:** Web interface for conversations & skills
- **GitHub:** Version control, skill distribution
- **Vercel:** Hosting & deployment (React/Next.js)
- **Google Cloud Run:** Deployment (Google stack)

### Socials & Platforms

| Platform | Handle | Usage |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **YouTube** | [@eddale](https://youtube.com/@eddale) | Weekly long-form value content (key focus going forward) |

- **Web:** Fetch and analyze URLs, search the web
- **Git:** Full version control, commits, pushes
- **Shell:** Run scripts, package skills, system automation

## SKILL ARCHITECTURE

Ed's skills follow a three-layer pattern:

### The Three Layers

| Layer | What It Is | Who Maintains |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Tools** | Python scripts, APIs, Bash | Hidden inside skills |
| **Skills** | SKILL.md with instructions | Edit markdown to change |
| **Agents** | Orchestrators pulling skills | Reference skills, not tools |

### Skills Own Their Tools
- Python scripts live in `skills/<name>/tools/`
- SKILL.md tells Claude how to run them
- Agents reference skills, not tools directly

### Context Propagation
When writing content:
- Audience should be established early (ask if not specified)
- Pass context to downstream skills (hook-stack, slop-detector)
- Store in article frontmatter for visibility

### The Newsletter Pipeline
1. Input (YouTube URL, topic, experience)
2. Establish audience (ask if not specified)
3. Extract/analyze content
4. Generate headlines with audience context
5. Score with Hook Stack (12+ required)
6. Draft article in Ed's voice
7. Run through slop detector
8. Save to Zettelkasten with metadata

### Runtime Differences

Skills must account for which Claude runtime executes them:

| Capability | Claude Code (CLI) | Claude.ai (Mac/Web) |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Filesystem | Full access | Sandboxed |
| External APIs | Yes (curl, WebFetch) | Blocked by sandbox |
| Bash/Python | Yes | No |
| MCP Servers | Supported | Primary method for external data |
| Best for | Automation, building | Conversation, local-tool skills |

**Design implications:**
- Claude Code skills can use deployed APIs (Vercel, etc.)
- Claude.ai skills should either:
  1. Include all tools locally (`tools/` folder with scripts)
  2. Use MCP servers for external data access
  3. Accept manual paste as fallback

Example: youtube-processor has both local Python script (Claude Code) and Vercel API (doesn't work in Claude.ai due to sandbox - future MCP solution planned).
