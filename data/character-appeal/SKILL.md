# Character Appeal

Think like a casting director watching auditions. Appeal isn't just "cute"—it's magnetic. Characters must demand attention, invite empathy, and feel uniquely themselves.

## Core Mental Model

Before animating any character, ask: **Why would anyone want to watch this person?**

Appeal is the quality that makes audiences invest. It's not prettiness—villains have appeal. It's the sense that this character is worth following. Their movement reveals their soul.

## The 12 Principles Through Personality

**Appeal** — The principle itself. Design and motion that invites connection. Clear silhouette. Readable expression. Movement that expresses inner life. Characters you remember.

**Solid Drawing** — Characters must have dimensional presence. They need to feel like they could be picked up, like they have weight and mass. Solidity creates believability.

**Exaggeration** — Personality pushed to clarity. A cautious character is *extremely* cautious in movement. A bold character moves with *unmistakable* confidence. Amplify defining traits.

**Staging** — Present characters for maximum impact. Their best angles, their clearest poses. Give them their spotlight moment. Staging serves character.

**Anticipation** — Character-specific preparation. How does *this particular character* wind up for action? A nervous character anticipates differently than a confident one.

**Timing** — Personal tempo. Every character has their own natural rhythm. Quick and anxious. Slow and deliberate. Timing is personality in motion.

**Secondary Action** — Habits and quirks. The gestures a character does without thinking. A hair-twirl, a nose-scratch, a weight-shift. Secondary actions individualize.

**Follow Through & Overlapping Action** — Physical personality. Heavy characters settle differently than light ones. Hair and clothing respond to how the character moves.

**Squash & Stretch** — Elasticity of personality. Rigid characters barely squash. Flexible personalities stretch easily. The body type reflects the inner type.

**Arcs** — Personal movement quality. Graceful characters move in flowing arcs. Aggressive characters have sharp direction changes. The shape of motion is character.

**Slow In & Slow Out** — Energy signature. How does this character accelerate and decelerate? Gentle easing or snappy action? Each character has their own physics.

**Straight Ahead & Pose to Pose** — Character work often benefits from straight ahead exploration to find unexpected personality moments, then pose-to-pose refinement for clarity.

## Practical Application

**Appeal Elements:**
- Recognizable silhouette: Know who it is from shape alone
- Asymmetry: Perfect symmetry feels dead
- Contrast: Big/small, round/angular, fast/slow
- Specificity: Unique details over generic design
- Relatability: Something the audience recognizes in themselves

**Character Movement Questions:**
- How does this character walk? (Swagger? Shuffle? March?)
- How do they use their hands when talking?
- What's their resting pose?
- How do they react to surprise? Anger? Joy?
- What movement do they do that no other character does?

**Building Character Through Motion:**
1. Define three core personality traits
2. Find the physical expression of each trait
3. Establish signature gestures
4. Determine personal timing/tempo
5. Create contrast with other characters

When character feels "generic":
1. Push distinguishing traits further
2. Add specific secondary action habits
3. Develop personal timing distinct from others
4. Find asymmetry in poses and movement

When character feels "unappealing":
1. Clarify silhouette
2. Add vulnerability or desire
3. Ensure actions are motivated
4. Create moments of recognition

**Types of Appeal:**
- Sympathetic: We want to protect them
- Aspirational: We want to be them
- Fascinating: We can't look away
- Comedic: They make us laugh
- Menacing: They thrill us with danger

## The Golden Rule

**Appeal is the promise that this character is worth your time.** Every motion should reveal who they are. Characters aren't moving puppets—they're people. Give them souls, and audiences will follow them anywhere.
