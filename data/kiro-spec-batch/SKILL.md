# Spec Batch

<background_information>
- **Success Criteria**:
  - All features have complete spec files (spec.json, requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
  - Dependency ordering respected (upstream specs complete before downstream)
  - Feature execution respects dependency ordering, delegation availability, and host permissions
  - Cross-spec consistency verified (data models, interfaces, naming)
  - Mixed roadmap context understood without breaking `## Specs (dependency order)` parsing
  - When delegated, feature workers handle per-spec context
</background_information>

<instructions>

## Step 1: Read Roadmap and Validate

1. Read `{{KIRO_DIR}}/steering/roadmap.md`
2. Parse the `## Specs (dependency order)` section to extract:
   - Feature names
   - One-line descriptions
   - Dependencies for each feature
   - Completion status (`[x]` = done, `[ ]` = pending)
3. If present, also read for context:
   - `## Existing Spec Updates`
   - `## Direct Implementation Candidates`
   Do not include these in dependency-wave execution; they are awareness-only inputs for sequencing and consistency review.
4. For each pending feature in `## Specs (dependency order)`, verify `{{KIRO_DIR}}/specs/<feature>/brief.md` exists
5. If any brief.md is missing, stop and report: "Missing brief.md for: [list]. Run `/kiro-discovery` to generate briefs first."

## Step 2: Build Dependency Waves

Group pending features into waves based on dependencies:

- **Wave 1**: Features with no dependencies (or all dependencies already completed `[x]`)
- **Wave 2**: Features whose dependencies are all in Wave 1 or already completed
- **Wave N**: Features whose dependencies are all in earlier waves or already completed

Display the execution plan, labeling each wave as parallel, sequential foreground, or inline according to the execution mode actually available:
```
Spec Batch Plan:
  Wave 1 (parallel): app-foundation
  Wave 2 (parallel): block-editor, page-management
  Wave 3 (parallel): sidebar-navigation, database-views
  Wave 4 (parallel): cli-integration
  Total: 6 specs across 4 waves
```

If roadmap contains `## Existing Spec Updates` or `## Direct Implementation Candidates`, mention them separately as non-batch items so the user can see the whole decomposition.

## Step 3: Execute Waves

For each wave, use Devin's native `run_subagent` tool with `subagent_general`, following the schema exposed in this session. Pass the exact checkout and absolute input paths. Run independent features in background workers only when their required tool permissions are already granted; otherwise use foreground workers sequentially. Collect completed results through the native lifecycle (`read_subagent` when needed) before advancing the wave. A denied background tool must be handled through foreground approval, not treated as successful completion.

Before dispatch, resolve `../kiro-spec-init/SKILL.md`, `../kiro-spec-requirements/SKILL.md`, `../kiro-spec-design/SKILL.md`, and `../kiro-spec-tasks/SKILL.md` relative to this skill's installed directory. Insert their absolute paths into the prompt below.

**For each feature in the wave**, spawn a sub-agent with this task:

```
Create a complete specification for feature "{feature-name}" in checkout {checkout-root}.
This batch uses the existing fast-track spec mode. Bind $1 to "{feature-name}" for requirements, design, and tasks; bind $2 to "-y" for design/tasks before following their instructions. This only selects their documented approval mode and never bypasses required review gates.

1. Read the brief at {{KIRO_DIR}}/specs/{feature-name}/brief.md for feature context
2. Read the roadmap at {{KIRO_DIR}}/steering/roadmap.md for project context
3. Execute the full spec pipeline in this worker. Built-in Devin children cannot delegate further by default; apply required phase reviews inline when no child-delegation tools are available. For each phase, read the corresponding skill's SKILL.md for complete instructions (templates, rules, review gates):
   a. Initialize: If spec.json already exists, reuse that spec without reinitializing or renaming it. Otherwise read {spec-init-skill-path}; use the brief as the project description and initialize spec.json and requirements.md in the existing brief directory. Later phases may update their own artifacts.
   b. Generate requirements: Read {spec-requirements-skill-path} and execute it with the bound feature argument
   c. Generate design: Read {spec-design-skill-path} and execute it with arguments "{feature-name} -y", including the required design review
   d. Generate tasks: Read {spec-tasks-skill-path} and execute it with arguments "{feature-name} -y", including the required task review
4. Let each successful phase record its approvals through its documented fast-track flow. If a phase review fails or needs human input, report the blocker to the parent and stop this feature; do not force its approvals to true
5. Report completion with file list and task count
```

If native subagent tools are unavailable or disabled, execute features in the wave sequentially in the main context. Apply cross-spec review and remediation inline too, and report that no independent subagents were used.

**After all sub-agents in the wave complete**:
1. Verify each feature has: spec.json, requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md
2. If any feature failed, report the error and continue with features that succeeded
3. Display wave completion: "Wave N complete: [features]. Files verified."
4. Proceed to next wave

## Step 4: Cross-Spec Review

After all waves complete, use a fresh `subagent_general` through `run_subagent` for cross-spec consistency review when available; otherwise perform it inline. Prefer foreground execution and wait for completion before handling findings. This is the highest-value quality gate -- it catches issues that per-spec review gates cannot.

**Sub-agent task**:

Read ALL generated specs and check for consistency across the entire project:
- `{{KIRO_DIR}}/specs/*/design.md` (primary: contains interfaces, data models, architecture)
- `{{KIRO_DIR}}/specs/*/requirements.md` (for scope and acceptance criteria)
- `{{KIRO_DIR}}/specs/*/tasks.md` (for boundary annotations only -- read _Boundary:_ lines, skip task descriptions)
- `{{KIRO_DIR}}/steering/roadmap.md`

Reading priority: Focus on design.md files (they contain interfaces, data models, architecture). For requirements.md, focus on section headings and acceptance criteria. For tasks.md, focus on _Boundary:_ annotations.

Check:
1. **Data model consistency**: Same entities defined consistently across specs (field names, types, relationships)
2. **Interface alignment**: Where spec A outputs what spec B consumes, do contracts match exactly?
3. **No duplicate functionality**: Any capability specified in more than one spec?
4. **Dependency completeness**: Every design.md references correct upstream specs? Implicit dependencies not in roadmap?
5. **Naming conventions**: Component names, file paths, API routes, table names consistent across specs?
6. **Shared infrastructure**: Shared concerns (auth, error handling, logging) handled in one spec and correctly referenced?
7. **Task boundary alignment**: Task _Boundary:_ annotations partition codebase cleanly? No files claimed by multiple specs?
8. **Roadmap boundary continuity**: If roadmap includes `Existing Spec Updates` or `Direct Implementation Candidates`, do the generated new specs avoid absorbing that work by accident?
9. **Architecture boundary integrity**: Do the specs preserve clean responsibility seams, avoid shared ownership, keep dependency direction coherent, and include enough revalidation triggers to catch downstream impact?
10. **Change-friendly decomposition**: Has any spec absorbed multiple independent seams that should probably be split instead of kept together?

Output: CONSISTENT areas + ISSUES with (which specs, what's inconsistent, suggested fix).

**After the review sub-agent returns**:
- **Critical/important issues found**: Dispatch fix sub-agents for each affected spec to apply the suggested fixes. If the issue is really a decomposition problem (for example boundary overlap or one spec carrying multiple independent seams), stop and return to roadmap/discovery instead of papering over it locally. Re-run cross-spec review after fixes (max 3 remediation rounds).
- **Minor issues only**: Report them for user awareness, proceed to Step 5.
- **No issues**: Proceed to Step 5.

## Step 5: Finalize

1. Scan `{{KIRO_DIR}}/specs/*/tasks.md` to verify all specs exist
2. For each completed spec, read spec.json to confirm phase and approvals
3. Update roadmap.md: mark completed specs as `[x]`
4. If roadmap.md includes `Existing Spec Updates` or `Direct Implementation Candidates`, leave them untouched and mention them as remaining follow-up items unless already explicitly completed elsewhere

Display final summary:
```
Spec Batch Complete:
  ✓ app-foundation: X requirements, Y design components, Z tasks
  ✓ block-editor: ...
  ✓ page-management: ...
  ...
  Total: N specs created, M tasks generated
  Cross-spec review: PASSED / N issues found (M fixed)
  Existing spec updates pending: <count or none>
  Direct implementation candidates pending: <count or none>

Next: Review generated specs, then start implementation with /kiro-impl <feature>
```

</instructions>

## Critical Constraints
- **Controller context**: When delegating, keep per-spec generation in workers. In inline fallback, read the phase instructions and spec inputs needed to perform their checks in the main context.
- **Wave ordering is strict**: Never start a wave until all features in previous waves are complete.
- **Execution within waves**: Use parallel workers only with native delegation and already-approved required tools; otherwise use sequential foreground workers, or inline execution when delegation is unavailable.
- **No partial waves**: If a feature in a wave fails, still complete the other features in that wave before reporting.
- **Skip completed specs**: Features with `[x]` in roadmap.md or existing tasks.md are skipped.
- **`## Specs (dependency order)` remains authoritative for batch execution**: Other roadmap sections are context, not wave inputs.

## Safety & Fallback

**Sub-agent failure**:
- Log the error, skip the failed feature
- Continue with remaining features in the wave
- Report failed features in the summary
- Suggest: "Run `/kiro-spec-quick <feature> --auto` manually for failed features."

**Circular dependencies**:
- If dependency graph has cycles, report the cycle and stop
- Suggest: "Fix dependency ordering in roadmap.md"

**Roadmap not found**:
- Stop and report: "No roadmap.md found. Run `/kiro-discovery` first."

**All specs already complete**:
- Report: "All specs in roadmap.md are already complete. Nothing to do."
