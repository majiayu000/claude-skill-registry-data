# Instagram Stories Crafter Skill

## Algorithm Signals (December 2025)

Stories prioritize relationship strength over reach:

| Signal | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Viewing history | Stories from accounts you watch regularly appear first |
| Engagement history | Accounts you've DMed or reacted to get priority |
| Closeness | Close Friends stories appear at the beginning |
| Recency | Newer stories surface higher |

**Key insight**: Stories reward consistency and relationship-building, not virality.

## The 5-Slide Rule

> "The moment your Story slide count goes over five, you'll start to notice a dip in views and engagement." — Adam Mosseri

**Best practice**: 3-7 slides max per Story sequence.

Structure:
```
Slide 1: HOOK (stops the tap-through)
Slides 2-4: VALUE (core content)
Slide 5: CTA (action or engagement)
```

If content requires more slides, break into multiple Story sequences posted hours apart.

## Interactive Stickers

Stickers are the primary engagement driver. Use strategically:

### High-Engagement Stickers

| Sticker | Best For | Engagement Level |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Poll** | Quick binary choices, opinions | Very High |
| **Quiz** | Testing knowledge, fun facts | Very High |
| **Question** | AMAs, feedback, conversation starters | High |
| **Emoji Slider** | Gauging sentiment, reactions | High |
| **Add Yours** | Starting trends, UGC collection | High (viral potential) |

### Utility Stickers

| Sticker | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **Link** | Drive traffic to newsletter, articles, products |
| **Mention** | Tag collaborators, feature followers |
| **Location** | Local relevance, event promotion |
| **Countdown** | Build anticipation for launches |
| **Music** | Mood setting, trend participation |

### Sticker Placement Rules

- Place where they won't be covered by UI (avoid bottom edges)
- One interactive sticker per slide (less is more)
- Make tap target large enough for mobile

## Story Formats

### Educational Story (Data/Tech)

```
Slide 1: "¿Sabías que [surprising stat]?" + Emoji Slider
Slide 2: Context/explanation
Slide 3: Key insight with visual
Slide 4: "¿Quieres aprender más?" + Poll (Sí/No)
Slide 5: Link to newsletter or post
```

### Behind-the-Scenes

```
Slide 1: "Así estoy trabajando en [project]" + casual photo/video
Slide 2: Process detail + Question sticker ("¿Qué parte les interesa más?")
Slide 3: Quick tip from the work
```

### Newsletter Promotion

```
Slide 1: Teaser insight from newsletter (eye-catching visual)
Slide 2: "Esto y más en el nuevo tacosdedatos" + Link sticker
Slide 3: Poll: "¿Ya lo leíste?" (Sí/Aún no)
```

### Q&A / AMA

```
Slide 1: "Pregúntame lo que quieras sobre [topic]" + Question sticker
[Wait for responses]
Slides 2-5: Answer best questions (video or text)
Final slide: "Más preguntas → DM abiertos"
```

### Quick Tip

```
Slide 1: "Tip rápido de [topic]:" + bold text
Slide 2: The tip (visual + concise text)
Slide 3: Quiz: "¿Sabías esto?" (Sí/No/Más o menos)
```

## Video in Stories

Stories support up to 60 seconds of continuous video (no more 15-second splits).

**Best practices:**
- Front-load key info (people tap through quickly)
- Add captions for silent viewing
- Use native recording for authentic feel
- Mix video with static slides for variety

## Link Strategy

The Link sticker is your traffic driver:

**Do:**
- Use clear CTA text on the sticker ("Lee el artículo", "Suscríbete")
- Warm up with 1-2 context slides before the link
- Track clicks in Story analytics

**Don't:**
- Post link-only Stories (no context)
- Use links every day (save for important content)
- Forget to customize sticker text (default "Link" is weak)

## Posting Cadence

### Daily Minimum
- 1-3 Stories/day maintains presence and relationship signals

### Growth Mode
- Multiple Stories throughout the day
- Mix of: casual updates, educational content, engagement stickers
- Respond to DMs and reactions promptly

### Timing
- Stories have 24-hour lifespan, so timing is flexible
- Post when audience is active (check analytics)
- Spread throughout day rather than all at once

## Content Mix

For tacosdedatos specifically:

| Type | Frequency | Examples |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Behind-the-scenes | 2-3x/week | Writing process, tools, workspace |
| Quick tips | 2-3x/week | Python tricks, viz tips |
| Polls/Quizzes | Daily | Engage audience on data topics |
| Newsletter promos | Each issue | Teaser + link |
| Reposts | As relevant | Share mentions, good replies |
| Personal | 1-2x/week | Humanize the brand |

## Analytics to Track

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Reach** | Unique accounts that saw Story |
| **Impressions** | Total views (including rewatches) |
| **Completion Rate** | % who watched to the end (higher = engaging) |
| **Taps Forward** | Users skipping slides (too slow/boring) |
| **Taps Back** | Users rewatching (good — content was valuable) |
| **Exits** | Users leaving Story entirely (problem indicator) |
| **Replies** | Direct engagement (best signal) |
| **Sticker Taps** | Engagement with interactive elements |
| **Link Clicks** | Traffic driven (key for newsletters) |

**Red flags:**
- High Taps Forward on slide 1 = weak hook
- High Exits mid-sequence = content not holding attention
- Low sticker engagement = wrong sticker or bad placement

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Consistency
- Use brand colors consistently
- Same fonts across Stories
- Templates for recurring formats (tips, promos)

### Mobile-First
- Large, readable text (test on small screen)
- Contrast for readability
- Leave margins for UI elements

### Accessibility
- Add captions to videos
- Describe images in text
- Use high-contrast colors
