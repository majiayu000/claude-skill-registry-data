# Usage Health Scorecard Skill

## When to Use
- Tracking activation/retention metrics for self-serve and hybrid customer cohorts.
- Monitoring the impact of PLG experiments on core product health.
- Sharing health snapshots with product, growth, and CS leads.

## Framework
1. **Metric Groups** – activation, engagement, collaboration, monetization, support load.
2. **Segmentation** – persona, plan, cohort, region, product area.
3. **Thresholds** – traffic light ranges for each metric with warning/critical bands.
4. **Alerting** – notification rules for drops, anomalies, or experiment impacts.
5. **Action Registry** – log remediation steps, owners, due dates, and results.

## Templates
- Scorecard layout (metric, current, target, delta, owner).
- Dashboard wireframe with spark lines + annotations.
- Action tracker for follow-up tasks linked to health changes.

## Tips
- Pair with `launch-in-app-experiments` to watch guardrails post-launch.
- Include qualitative signals (support tags, NPS) to contextualize telemetry.
- Archive snapshots to tell longitudinal stories in QBRs.
