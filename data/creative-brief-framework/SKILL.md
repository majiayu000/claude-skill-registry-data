## Framework
1. **Objective & Success Metrics** – clarify business goal, KPIs, and constraints.
2. **Audience & Insights** – detail personas, pain points, and proof points.
3. **Message & Tone** – outline pillars, RTBs, must-say/avoid guidance.
4. **Deliverables & Channels** – list required assets, specs, and priority order.
5. **Logistics** – include timeline, approvals, budget, references, and point people.
