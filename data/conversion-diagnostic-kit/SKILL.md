# Conversion Diagnostic Kit Skill

## When to Use
- Sudden drops in conversion, AOV, or checkout completion.
- Preparing experiment backlogs tied to funnel pain points.
- Aligning engineering, UX, and marketing on remediation priorities.

## Framework
1. **Signal Stack** – analytics, heatmaps, session replay, VOC, performance metrics.
2. **Segmentation Grid** – device, channel, geography, campaign, customer type.
3. **Issue Taxonomy** – UX friction, merchandising mismatch, technical/performance, policy/payment.
4. **Prioritization Model** – score by impact, confidence, effort, and guardrail risk.
5. **Action Tracker** – link issues to owners, experiments, or engineering tickets.

## Templates
- Conversion diagnostic workbook (data inputs, findings, recommended tests).
- Standup agenda for cross-functional conversion war rooms.
- Experiment brief template with hypothesis, KPIs, guardrails.

## Tips
- Pair quant data with VOC clips for stakeholder alignment.
- Keep diagnostics lightweight (48-hour turnaround) for high-velocity campaigns.
- Use alongside `diagnose-conversion-drop` command for automated reporting.
