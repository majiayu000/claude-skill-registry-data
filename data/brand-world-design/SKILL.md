# Brand World Design Skill

## Overview

Brand World Design (BWD) transforms brand strategy development into a journey through Seven Chambers, each governed by a Hermetic principle and guarded by a specialized agent.

Built on Subfracture's "Whole of World Design" philosophy, BWD treats brands not as logos or taglines but as complete worlds that people enter.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when users:
- Want to develop brand strategy or positioning
- Need to define their target audience (MVP)
- Want to articulate their brand purpose or vision
- Need the FOR/ONLY/BECAUSE positioning framework
- Want creative strategy using Problem-Insight-Truth-Solution
- Ask about brand differentiation or competitive positioning
- Want to create a comprehensive Brand World Document

## The Seven Chambers

| Chamber | Guardian | Principle | Focus |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Mind** | The Visionary (Maya) | Mentalism | Purpose, vision, essence |
| **Mirrors** | The Architect (Kai) | Correspondence | FOR/ONLY/BECAUSE positioning |
| **Resonance** | The Resonant (Rio) | Vibration | Audience, MVP, tribes |
| **Poles** | The Navigator (Alex) | Polarity | Differentiation, objectives |
| **Rhythm** | The Bard (Zara) | Rhythm | Problem-Insight-Truth-Solution |
| **Chains** | The Skeptic (Sam) | Cause & Effect | Validation |
| **Union** | The Weaver (Danni) | Gender | Synthesis |

## Core Frameworks

### FOR/ONLY/BECAUSE Positioning

**FOR**: Who is this specifically for? Not everyone. Someone specific.
> "For [specific audience] who [specific need]..."

**ONLY**: What makes you the only one? Not different. ONLY.
> "[Brand] is the only [category] that [unique attribute]..."

**BECAUSE**: Why should they believe you? What proof exists?
> "Because [evidence/credentials/story]..."

**Example (KFC)**:
- FOR busy families who want satisfying meals without the wait
- KFC is the ONLY fast food chain with a secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices
- BECAUSE Colonel Sanders perfected it over decades

### PITS Creative Strategy

**PROBLEM**: What's the tension in your customer's world?
- Surface problem (what they complain about)
- Deeper problem (the problem behind the problem)

**INSIGHT**: What do you understand that others don't?
- The "aha" that reframes everything

**TRUTH**: What's the uncomfortable reality no one says?
- What people feel but don't articulate

**SOLUTION**: How does your brand become the inevitable answer?

## Key Questions by Chamber

### Chamber of Mind
- "What does this brand mean to you personally?"
- "In one word — the essence beneath everything?"
- "Twenty years from now, what does this become?"

### Chamber of Mirrors
- "Who specifically is this for?"
- "What can you say that NO competitor can honestly say?"
- "Why should anyone believe that?"

### Chamber of Resonance
- "Who vibrates at the same frequency?"
- "What tribe do they belong to?"
- "What keeps them up at night?"

### Chamber of Poles
- "What are the extremes in your category?"
- "Who is your polar opposite?"
- "What's the ONE thing that would move the needle most?"

### Chamber of Rhythm
- "What's the most common frustration before they find you?"
- "What's the insight that makes everything click?"
- "What's the uncomfortable truth no one talks about?"

### Chamber of Chains
- "Can you prove that?"
- "What would a competitor say?"
- "What's the most likely way this fails?"
