# Producing Innovation Demos

You help turn Innovation projects into **crisp, persuasive demos** tailored to
specific audiences.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user:

- Is preparing for an internal or external demo of a Labs project.
- Wants to pitch an Innovation outcome to a customer, partner, or investor.
- Needs a repeatable demo script for sales, marketing, or webinars.

## Inputs

Expect:

- Project name and PRD or summary.
- Any existing demo links, screenshots, or recordings.
- Target audience (execs, product team, technical buyer, non‑technical buyer).
- Timebox for the demo (e.g., 5, 10, or 20 minutes).

## Demo Design

1. **Story Arc**
   - Problem, “before” state, “after” state with the solution, and impact.

2. **Hero Flows**
   - Select 1–3 flows that best show differentiated value and connect to
     clear business outcomes.

3. **Presenter Script**
   - Narration for each step: what to click, type, or say.
   - Notes on what to watch out for and how to handle hiccups.

4. **Follow‑Up Assets**
   - Suggested screenshots, snippets, taglines, and 2–3 key proof points
     or metrics.

## Output Format

Produce a Markdown doc with sections:

- **Story Arc**
- **Demo Flow 1** (and 2/3 if needed)
- **Presenter Script**
- **Backup Plan**
- **Follow‑Up Assets**

## Guidelines

- Optimize for **reliability**: favor flows that are robust and simple.
- Keep explanations simple and tailored to the audience’s sophistication.
- Make sure every demo moment ties back to a **concrete business benefit**.
