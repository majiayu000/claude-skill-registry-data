# Enrollment Persona Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- Planning enrollment marketing campaigns across multiple segments.
- Aligning admissions, marketing, and partner teams on persona insights.
- Prioritizing offers, proof points, and stewardship plans per persona.

## Framework
1. **Persona Canvas** – demographic profile, motivations, barriers, channel preferences.
2. **Journey Stage Mapping** – inquiry, application, admission, enrollment, retention cues.
3. **Messaging Architecture** – value pillars, proof points, offers, objection handling.
4. **Channel Mix Guidance** – recommended channels + creative formats per persona.
5. **Measurement & Signals** – KPIs and health thresholds per stage/persona.

## Templates
- Persona worksheet (demographics, motivations, triggers, objections).
- Messaging matrix (pillar → proof → CTA → disclosure).
- Channel + content pairing cheat sheet.

## Tips
- Revisit personas each term to incorporate economic, policy, or competitor shifts.
- Include parent/influencer personas when applicable (K-12, higher-ed).
- Pair with `analyze-enrollment-funnel` to prioritize high-impact segments.
