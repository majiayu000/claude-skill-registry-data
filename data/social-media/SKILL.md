### Platform-Specific Optimization

```typescript
interface PlatformConfig {
  twitter: {
    maxLength: number;      // 280 characters
    threadLength: number;   // 5-15 tweets
    hashtagLimit: number;   // 1-2 hashtags
    bestTimes: string[];    // [9am, 12pm, 6pm]
  };
  linkedin: {
    maxLength: number;      // 3,000 characters
    optimalLength: string;  // 1,500-2,000 chars
    hashtagLimit: number;   // 3-5 hashtags
    bestTimes: string[];    // [8am, 10am, 12pm];
  };
  instagram: {
    maxLength: number;      // 2,200 characters
    carouselSlides: number; // 5-10 slides
    hashtagLimit: number;   // 5-30 hashtags;
  };
}
```

### The Hook Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HOOK TYPES                                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Question Hook    → "What if everything..."  │
│ Stat Hook        → "93% of marketers..."    │
│ Story Hook       → "I almost made a..."     │
│ Controversy Hook → "The opposite of..."     │
│ Future Hook      → "In 5 years, we'll..."   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Thread Architecture

```markdown
TWEET 1 (Hook): Attention grabber + promise
TWEET 2 (Context): Brief setup + why it matters
TWEET 3-7 (Body): Main points, one per tweet
TWEET 8 (Example): Concrete illustration
TWEET 9 (CTA): Ask for engagement + follow
TWEET 10 (Close): Memorable finish + #content
```

## Patterns

### Pattern 1: Twitter Thread Structure

```markdown
1/ [NUMBER] [TRANSFORMATIVE STATEMENT] about [TOPIC]

A [SHORT] breakdown 🧵👇

2/ [Context or background - 2 sentences]

3/ [First key insight]
[Supporting detail or example]

4/ [Second key insight]
[Supporting detail or example]

5/ [Third key insight]
[Supporting detail or example]

6/ [Practical application]
Here's how to apply this:

7/ [The framework or synthesis]

8/ [Your experience or case study]

9/ [Challenge or question to audience]

10/ If you enjoyed this:
• Follow for more [TOPIC] insights
• RT the first tweet to share
• [Related content link]

[#industry #topic #advice]
```

### Pattern 2: LinkedIn Thought Leadership Post

```markdown
[PROVOCATIVE OPENING - 1-2 sentences]

[PROBLEM STATEMENT - Why this matters]

Here's what's happening:

[KEY INSIGHT 1]
→ [Explanation and why it matters]

[KEY INSIGHT 2]  
→ [Explanation and why it matters]

[KEY INSIGHT 3]
→ [Explanation and why it matters]

The opportunity for those who act:

[FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT]

What I'm doing about this:

[YOUR ACTION OR PROJECT]

Questions for you:

[Q1 - Engaging question]
[Q2 - Engaging question]

[CTA - What should they do next?]

#[hashtag1] #[hashtag2] #[hashtag3] #[hashtag4] #[hashtag5]
```

### Pattern 3: Instagram Educational Carousel

```SLIDE 1: Title Slide (Hook)》
"5 [TRANSFORMATIVE] Ways to [DESIRED OUTCOME]"
"Save this for later"

《SLIDE 2: Problem Statement》
"The biggest mistake most people make..."

《SLIDE 3: Solution Overview》
"Here's what actually works:"

《SLIDE 4-8: Each Method》
"[NUMBER]. [METHOD NAME]"
- [Key benefit]
- [How to implement]
- [Example]

《SLIDE 9: Quick Wins》
"Start with #1 for immediate results"

《SLIDE 10: CTA》
"Follow for more [TOPIC] tips"
"Save this post"
```

## FrankX Application

```markdown
**[FrankX Provocative Voice]**

The future belongs to those who create it.

Not consume.
Not critique.
CREATE.

3 principles for becoming a creator:

1/ Ship weekly

The magic is in the practice.
Your first 100 posts will be terrible.
Your second 100 will be mediocre.
Your third 100? Game-changing.

2/ Think in public

Share your process.
Your half-baked ideas.
Your experiments.
Your failures.

This builds trust faster than perfection.

3/ Build in public

Show the behind-the-scenes.
Your tools. Your stack. Your wins.

The audience wants to see the journey.

This is how we build the golden age.

|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Same post everywhere | Ignores platform norms | Adapt for each platform |
| No hook in first line | People scroll past | Start with attention-grabber |
| Too many hashtags | Looks spammy, hurts reach | Platform-appropriate amount |
| Only self-promotion | Provides no value | 80% value, 20% promotion |
| Inconsistent posting | Algorithm punishment | Regular posting schedule |
| Ignoring engagement | Misses relationship building | Respond to all comments |
