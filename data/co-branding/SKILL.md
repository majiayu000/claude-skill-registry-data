# Co-branding Guidelines Skill

## When to Use
- Designing shared assets, landing pages, and creative for partner initiatives.
- Reviewing partner-submitted collateral before distribution.
- Training agencies or external teams on brand usage.

## Framework
1. **Brand Hierarchy** – determine logo lockups, dominance rules, color usage, and typography.
2. **Messaging Alignment** – define shared narrative, value props, boilerplate, and CTA guidance.
3. **Legal/Compliance** – include disclaimers, TM/® usage, privacy statements, and required approvals.
4. **Localization** – document translation rules, regional references, and regulatory considerations.
5. **Version Control** – track asset versions, expiry dates, and update cadence.

## Templates
- Co-branding checklist (logos, copy, disclaimers, accessibility, localization).
- Messaging matrix (audience → key message → proof points → CTA).
- Visual reference guide with approved mockups.

## Tips
- Keep editable templates in shared workspaces to reduce iteration time.
- Pair with `asset-approval` skill for evidence tracking.
- Log exceptions with rationale and expiration date.
