# Permission Management Skill

## MANDATORY: Invoke docs-management First

> **STOP - Before providing ANY response about Claude Code permissions:**
>
> 1. **INVOKE** `docs-management` skill
> 2. **QUERY** for the user's specific topic
> 3. **BASE** all responses EXCLUSIVELY on official documentation loaded
>
> **Skipping this step results in outdated or incorrect information.**

### Verification Checkpoint

Before responding, verify:

- [ ] Did I invoke docs-management skill?
- [ ] Did official documentation load?
- [ ] Is my response based EXCLUSIVELY on official docs?

If ANY checkbox is unchecked, STOP and invoke docs-management first.

## Overview

Central authority for Claude Code permissions. This skill uses **100% delegation to docs-management** - it contains NO duplicated official documentation.

**Architecture:** Pure delegation with keyword registry. All official documentation is accessed via docs-management skill queries.

## When to Use This Skill

**Keywords:** permissions, allow rules, deny rules, ask rules, permission modes, defaultMode, acceptEdits, bypassPermissions, plan mode, tool permissions, Bash permissions, Read permissions, Edit permissions, WebFetch permissions, MCP permissions, additionalDirectories, /permissions

**Use this skill when:**

- Configuring permission rules
- Understanding permission modes
- Setting up tool-specific permissions
- Troubleshooting permission issues
- Adding additional working directories
- Understanding rule precedence
