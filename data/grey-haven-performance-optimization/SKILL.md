# Performance Optimization Skill

Comprehensive performance analysis and optimization techniques for identifying bottlenecks and improving application speed.

## Description

This skill provides production-ready patterns, examples, and checklists for optimizing application performance across algorithms, databases, infrastructure, and code structure.

## What's Included

### Examples (`examples/`)
- **Algorithm optimization** - Improve time complexity (O(n²) → O(n))
- **Database optimization** - Eliminate N+1 queries, add indexes
- **Bundle size reduction** - Code splitting, tree shaking
- **React performance** - Memoization, virtual lists
- **API response time** - Caching strategies, async processing
- **Memory optimization** - Reduce allocations, fix leaks

### Reference Guides (`reference/`)
- Performance profiling tools and techniques
- Benchmarking best practices
- Optimization decision frameworks
- Performance budget guidelines
- Monitoring and alerting strategies

### Templates (`templates/`)
- Performance test templates (Lighthouse, Web Vitals)
- Benchmark comparison templates
- Optimization report structures
- Performance budget definitions

## Use This Skill When

- Application is slow or unresponsive
- Response times exceed SLA targets
- High CPU/memory usage detected
- Need to meet performance budgets
- Optimizing for production deployment
