name: mechanical-engineer
description: Ability to design, analyse, test, and maintain mechanical systems and components that meet defined functional, safety, and performance requirements. Includes applying engineering principles to materials, structures, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and motion systems; producing and interpreting technical designs and specifications; validating designs through analysis and testing; and supporting manufacture, operation, and lifecycle management. Applies across industrial, infrastructure, energy, manufacturing, and product contexts and is independent of specific tools or industries, with human accountability retained for safety, compliance, and outcomes.
