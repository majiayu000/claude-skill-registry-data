description: This skill should be used when reviewing and validating training materials, workshop designs, facilitator guides, or learning journeys against evidence-based frameworks and best practices. Use this skill to assess compliance with TBR 4Cs, brain-friendly principles, 70:20:10 integration, and instructional quality.

# Training Reviewer

## Overview

The Training Reviewer skill provides comprehensive review and validation of training materials against evidence-based instructional frameworks. It helps identify gaps, ensure compliance with brain-friendly principles, validate time allocations, and surface opportunities for improvement before materials are delivered.

## When to Use This Skill

Use Training Reviewer when:
- Reviewing completed session designs or workshop agendas
- Validating facilitator guides against framework requirements
- Assessing learning journey designs for 70:20:10 balance
- Checking materials for brain-friendly principle compliance
- Identifying gaps in practice activities or support materials
- Preparing materials for pilot delivery
- Iterating after pilot feedback

## Core Review Frameworks

### TBR 4Cs Compliance Review

Every training session should allocate time appropriately across the 4Cs:

- **Connection: 10-15%** - Activates knowledge, builds safety
- **Concepts: 30-40%** - Chunked (max 15 min), with processing
- **Concrete Practice: 40-50%** - Guided → Collaborative → Independent
- **Conclusion: 5-10%** - Learner summary, commitments, celebration

### Brain-Friendly Principles Review

- **10-1 Rule**: No content delivery exceeds 15 minutes without processing
- **Active Learning**: Learners talk, teach, and do (not just listen)
- **Real Work**: Practice mirrors actual job tasks, not simulations
- **Chunking**: Content broken into manageable pieces (7-15 minutes max)
- **Multimodal**: Mix visual, auditory, kinesthetic, reading/writing

## Review Workflows

### Quick Review (30 minutes)

For rapid validation before pilot:

1. Check time allocations: Do 4Cs percentages match?
2. Check practice: Is 40-50% of time hands-on?
3. Check processing: Do concept chunks have processing activities?
4. Check realness: Are practice scenarios real work?
5. Check conclusion: Is it learner-generated (not facilitator summary)?

### Comprehensive Review (60-90 minutes)

For thorough validation of materials:

1. Review overall structure and learning objectives
2. Validate each framework component (use checklists in references/)
3. Identify all critical issues
4. Identify important improvements
5. Draft detailed review report

### Post-Pilot Review

After initial delivery:

1. Review pilot feedback on timing and flow
2. Update materials based on learner feedback
3. Check if changes maintain framework compliance
4. Document lessons learned

## Key Review Checklists

### Session Design Quick Check

- [ ] Connection: Activates prior knowledge? (~10-15 min)
- [ ] Concepts: No chunk exceeds 15 min? Processing follows each?
- [ ] Practice: 40-50% of time? Progression: guided→collab→independent?
- [ ] Conclusion: Learner-generated summary? Commitments?
- [ ] Timing: Exact minutes allocated for each section?

### Learning Journey Quick Check

- [ ] Business outcomes clearly defined?
- [ ] 70% work: Real projects, repeated practice, clear progression?
- [ ] 20% social: Coaching plan, peer learning, CoP defined?
- [ ] 10% training: Just-enough content, enables 70%/20%?
- [ ] Sustainability: Support defined beyond initial period?

## Common Issues to Flag

### Critical (Stop and Fix)

- Insufficient practice (< 40% of session)
- Lecture > 15 minutes without processing
- Missing Connection or Conclusion
- Simulated practice instead of real work
- No post-workshop support planned

### Important (Should Fix Before Pilot)

- Time allocations don't match 4Cs percentages
- Missing real work examples
- Unclear practice progression
- Processing activities don't follow chunks
- Incomplete facilitator notes

### Nice-to-Have (Iterate Later)

- More multimodal elements
- Deeper discussion questions
- Energy management tips
- Extension activities for advanced learners

## Review Best Practices

✅ **Do**:
- Review with frameworks as reference
- Identify specific, actionable issues
- Balance critical feedback with strengths
- Provide concrete recommendations
- Check for learner-centered design

❌ **Don't**:
- Use vague feedback
- Fix materials without discussion
- Ignore framework requirements
- Skip the strengths section
- Review in isolation
