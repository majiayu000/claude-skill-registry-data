# Onboarding Blueprint Skill

## When to Use
- Creating persona-based onboarding for new tiers or product lines.
- Refreshing onboarding journeys after major product changes.
- Aligning product, CS, and marketing on activation milestones.

## Framework
1. **Persona Canvas** – goals, motivations, blockers, success definition.
2. **Milestone Ladder** – aha moment, activation, stickiness, expansion triggers.
3. **Channel Mix** – in-app, email, docs, community, human assist with triggers.
4. **Instrumentation** – required events, metrics, and guardrails.
5. **Experiment Hooks** – backlog of tests tied to each milestone.

## Templates
- Journey table (step, trigger, message, owner, metric).
- Metric dashboard layout for activation + retention.
- Experiment backlog sheet linked to milestones.

## Tips
- Keep journeys lightweight; aim for 3-5 key milestones per persona.
- Combine qualitative inputs (surveys, interviews) with telemetry for context.
- Pair with `design-onboarding-journey` to auto-generate tailored blueprints.
