# Enterprise & B2B Animation Principles

Apply Disney's 12 principles to create trustworthy, efficient experiences that prioritize clarity and professional credibility.

## The 12 Principles Applied

### 1. Squash & Stretch
- **Almost Never**: Enterprise requires utmost professionalism
- **Data Points**: Subtle pulse for live updates
- **Buttons**: Minimal, if any, deformation

### 2. Anticipation
- **Form Submissions**: Brief processing indication
- **Data Actions**: Moment before confirmation
- **Navigation Changes**: Subtle preparation cues

### 3. Staging
- **Data Tables**: Primary content focus
- **Action Buttons**: Clear but not flashy
- **Notifications**: Non-disruptive placement

### 4. Straight Ahead & Pose to Pose
- **Dashboards**: Real-time data streams (straight ahead)
- **Wizards/Flows**: Explicit step progression (pose to pose)
- **Report Generation**: Sequential build

### 5. Follow Through & Overlapping Action
- **Table Updates**: Row highlights, then data refreshes
- **Panel Expansions**: Container opens, content follows
- **Filter Applications**: UI adjusts, then data loads

### 6. Slow In & Slow Out
- **All Transitions**: Smooth, professional easing
- **Modal Opens**: Confident 250-300ms
- **State Changes**: Deliberate, measured motion

### 7. Arc
- **Minimal Use**: Straight lines suggest efficiency
- **Drag Operations**: Slight natural curve
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: Curved connection lines

### 8. Secondary Action
- **Save Indicator**: Subtle spinner while processing
- **Sync Status**: Background activity indication
- **Validation**: Inline feedback during input

### 9. Timing
- **Efficient**: 150-250ms for most interactions
- **Never Delay Work**: Speed is respect for user time
- **Instant Feedback**: 100ms for input responses

### 10. Exaggeration
- **Avoid Completely**: Enterprise must be understated
- **Exception**: Critical alerts warrant attention
- **Milestone Only**: Major achievements, sparingly

### 11. Solid Drawing
- **Data Accuracy**: Charts must be precise
- **Typography**: Clear, readable business fonts
- **Icon System**: Consistent, professional set

### 12. Appeal
- **Professional Trust**: Motion builds credibility
- **Invisible Polish**: Refined but not flashy
- **Reliability Signal**: Consistent, predictable behavior

## Industry Timing Standards

| Action | Duration | Easing |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Button Feedback | 100ms | ease-out |
| Modal Open | 250ms | ease-out |
| Table Row Update | 200ms | ease-in-out |
| Panel Transition | 300ms | ease-in-out |
| Toast Message | 200ms | ease-out |

## Key Principle
Enterprise users are working, not playing. Animation exists solely to provide feedback, maintain orientation, and signal state changes. Every millisecond of animation must earn its place through utility.
