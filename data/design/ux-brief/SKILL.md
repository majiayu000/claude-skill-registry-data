# UX Brief Skill

Provides design system templates and patterns for creating comprehensive UI/UX briefs.

## When to Use

This skill is automatically invoked by the `/majestic:ux-brief` command. It provides:

- Design system template structure
- Color, typography, and spacing specifications
- Component state definitions
- Framework configuration examples

## Template

Read the design system template: [resources/design-system-template.md](resources/design-system-template.md)

## Key Principles

- **Junior-dev ready**: Document should be so complete that no follow-up questions are needed
- **Copy-paste ready**: All classes, values, and configs should be directly usable
- **Commit to a direction**: Avoid wishy-washy "a bit of everything" designs
- **Avoid AI slop**: No Inter font, no purple gradients, no predictable layouts
