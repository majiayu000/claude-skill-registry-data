# Sponsorship Playbook

## Core Philosophy

Sponsorships should create a win-win-win: value for the sponsor (ROI), value for the reader (relevant offers), and revenue for the publication. Never sacrifice reader trust for short-term sponsor revenue.

## Understanding Sponsorship Economics

### Key Metrics

#### CPM (Cost Per Mille)
Formula: `(Sponsorship Price / Subscribers) × 1,000`

| Audience Type | Typical CPM Range |
|--------------|-------------------|
| General consumer | $10-25 |
| B2B general | $25-50 |
| B2B specialized | $50-100 |
| High-value niche | $75-150+ |

#### Effective CPM (eCPM)
Based on opens: `(Price / (Subscribers × Open Rate)) × 1,000`

A 10,000 subscriber newsletter with 50% open rate has 5,000 effective impressions.

### Pricing by Subscriber Count

| Subscribers | Price Range | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| 1,000-5,000 | $50-300 | Focus on engagement over scale |
| 5,000-15,000 | $300-800 | Professional media kit needed |
| 15,000-50,000 | $800-3,000 | Multiple placement tiers |
| 50,000-100,000 | $3,000-10,000 | Premium pricing justified |
| 100,000+ | $10,000+ | Enterprise deals, custom packages |
