# Hook and Headline Writer

Create hooks and headlines that stop the scroll and compel action using systematic frameworks, not guesswork.

## Purpose

80% of content performance comes from the hook. This skill provides the frameworks to craft headlines that capture attention and drive engagement - for any industry, any platform, any content type.

**Core Philosophy:** Generate volume (10+ options), then select best using proven criteria. The first option is rarely the best option.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing newsletter subject lines that get opens
- Crafting social media thread hooks that stop the scroll
- Creating LinkedIn post first lines that compel "see more"
- Optimizing headlines for blog posts or articles
- Generating multiple hook variations for A/B testing

**Pairs well with:** `anti-ai-writing` (for humanizing headlines), voice style skills (for brand-specific tone)

---

## Key Principles

### The 3-Sentence Rule for Social Hooks
- Maximum 3 sentences for social media hooks
- First sentence MUST be short
- Each sentence's goal: get reader to the next

### The 25% Rule
How to allocate time on any content:
- 25% ideation (identifying what to say)
- 25% hook/headline (crafting how to say it)
- 50% body content

### Volume → Selection
- Generate 10+ variations minimum
- Select best using systematic criteria (not gut feel)
- The first option is rarely the best option

### Story = Problem + Goal + Path
This equation equals value. Use it to identify what transformation your hook promises.

---

## The 3-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Generate Hook Ideas (Ideation)

**Goal:** Identify the core benefit, transformation, or insight your hook will promise

#### Step 1: Use the "Start Questioning" Method

Ask who/what/where/when/why/how about your topic. Then dig deeper by asking multiple times on the same answer.

**Example:**
- **Topic:** Productivity systems
- **What?** "What is the system?" → Time-blocking with deep work periods
- **Why?** "Why does it work?" → Eliminates context switching
- **Why (deeper)?** "Why does that matter?" → You get 3x output in half the time
- **How?** "How do people fail at this?" → They schedule too many blocks
- **Impact angle discovered:** "The counterintuitive key to time-blocking: schedule LESS"

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Asked who/what/where/when/why/how
- [ ] Dug deeper at least 2-3 times on promising angles
- [ ] Identified a specific, impactful aspect (not just surface-level info)

#### Step 2: Identify the Transformation

Use the **Story = Problem + Goal + Path** framework:

- **Problem:** What struggle/pain does the audience face?
- **Goal:** What result do they want?
- **Path:** What's the journey between them?

**Example:**
- **Problem:** Knowledge workers feel busy but unproductive
- **Goal:** Get meaningful work done and leave on time
- **Path:** Discover the 3-block system that eliminates busywork

**Your hook should promise movement along this path.**

#### Step 3: Identify Headline Elements

Extract these 6 elements from your content:
1. **Problem** - What pain/struggle exists?
2. **Goal** - What result does reader want?
3. **Benefit** - What will their life look like after?
4. **Concept** - What idea/principle applies?
5. **Example** - What story/data illustrates this?
6. **Process** - What steps lead to the result?

You'll combine these in Phase 2 to generate variations.

#### Step 4: "Become the Reader" Check

Before moving to Phase 2, review from audience perspective:
- **Ask:** "What's in it for me?"
- **Check:** Is this too abstract? (If you can't picture it, neither can they)
- **Verify:** Would I stop scrolling for this?

---

### Phase 2: Select Hook Type & Formula

**Goal:** Match your idea to proven frameworks that amplify it best

#### The Headline Element Combination System

**Combine 2 of the 6 elements** to create headline structure:

| Combination | Formula | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Problem + Process** | "How to [Solve Problem] in [Steps]" | "How to Overcome Writer's Block in 5 Steps" |
| **Benefit + Timeframe** | "[Achieve Benefit] in [Time]" | "Double Your Productivity in 30 Days" |
| **Concept + Target Audience** | "[Concept] for [Specific People]" | "Minimalism for Busy Professionals" |
| **Goal + Benefit** | "[Achieve Goal] to [Get Benefit]" | "Build an Audience to Earn Money While You Sleep" |
| **Example + Process** | "[Specific Result] using [Method]" | "How I Hit 100K Followers Using 3 Simple Rules" |
| **Problem + Benefit** | "Stop [Problem] and Start [Benefit]" | "Stop Trading Time for Money and Start Building Passive Income" |

**How to use:**
1. Review your 6 elements from Phase 1
2. Try 5-10 different combinations
3. Select 2-3 that feel most powerful for your concept

#### Hook Type Selection

Choose the hook type that best matches your content goal:

**1. Curiosity Hooks** (create information gap)
- State what and why, leave out how
- State start and end, leave out middle
- Make bold claim, leave out data/proof

**Examples:**
- "I turned 33 today. I weighed in at 337lbs this week. Here's what happened and how I'll lose 140lbs in the next 18 months:"
- "10 years in SEO. Here's what every new marketer should know:"

---

**2. Transformation Hooks** (show before → after)
- Personal transformation stories
- Skill development timelines
- Business/financial progress

**Formula:** "[Before State] → [After State]. Here's how:"

**Examples:**
- "100 followers when I started. Last week, hit 10k. Here's how I did it:"
- "I quit my 9-5 in 6 months. The key? Mastering one high-income skill."

---

**3. Authority Hooks** (leverage expertise/results)
- Share years of experience
- Highlight specific achievements
- Borrow authority from others

**Formula:** "[Credentials/Results]. Here's what [audience] should know:"

**Examples:**
- "I've built and sold 3 startups. Here are 17 learnings for your entrepreneurial journey:"
- "I coached 12 clients to $40,000/month. If you want to hit $10K/month, read this:"

---

**4. Problem Callout Hooks** (identify pain immediately)
- Name the specific struggle
- Call out the mistake/gap
- Challenge common practice

**Formula:** "Are you making these [number] [topic] mistakes?"

**Examples:**
- "98.9% of people are still unaware of ChatGPT's full potential. Here are 10 advanced prompts:"
- "The costly mistake 90% of writers make"

---

**5. Target Callout Hooks** (speak directly to specific audience)
- Name the audience explicitly
- Address their specific context

**Formula:** "[Audience name]... [Action/insight they need]"

**Examples:**
- "Digital Writers... Stop committing these 4 headline mistakes"
- "Attention Founders: Your landing page is costing you customers"

---

**6. Bold Claim Hooks** (pattern interrupt)
- Make counterintuitive statement
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Present surprising data

**Formula:** "[Surprising/controversial claim]. Here's why:"

**Examples:**
- "AI will create millionaires. Here's how you can be part of it:"
- "Forget everything you know about headline writing"

---

#### Apply Sticky Sentence Techniques

Enhance your hook using these literary devices:

**Alliteration** - Same starting sounds
- "Specificity is the secret"
- "The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed"

**Symmetry** - Parallel structure
- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations."

**Contrast** - Opposing ideas
- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere"
- "Be clear, not clever. Concise, not complex."

**Rhyme** - Similar ending sounds
- "Tell a story or lose your glory"

**Rhythm** - Pleasing cadence
- "When you can't wait to share it, they can't help but read it"

**Combining techniques:** For maximum stickiness, combine multiple
- "Anger prepares us to fight. Fear prepares us to flee." (Symmetry + Alliteration)

### Phase 3: Optimize & Select Best

**Goal:** Generate 10+ variations and select the best using systematic criteria

#### Step 1: Generate Volume (10+ Variations)

Using different combinations from Phase 2:
- Try 3-4 different hook types
- Apply 2-3 different headline formulas
- Test with/without sticky sentence techniques
- Vary element combinations

**Minimum output:** 10 hook variations

**Example for "Productivity System" content:**

1. "I wasted 3 years on productivity hacks. Then I found the one that actually works."
2. "Why the most productive people schedule LESS (not more)"
3. "10 years optimizing workflows. Here's what every knowledge worker should know:"
4. "The 3-block system: How I 3x'd my output while working fewer hours"
5. "Are you making these 3 time-blocking mistakes? (Most people make #2)"
6. "From 12-hour days to leaving at 5pm. Here's what changed:"
7. "The counterintuitive productivity hack: do less, achieve more"
8. "Knowledge workers: Stop trying to be busy. Start trying to be effective."
9. "I've tested 50+ productivity systems. Save yourself 3 years with these findings:"
10. "Forget time management. The best workers manage energy instead."

#### Step 2: Apply the 10 Commandments of Engagement

Optimize your top 5-7 variations using this checklist:

1. **Numbers and Statistics**
   - [ ] Uses specific numbers (not "many" or "several")
   - [ ] Includes percentages, dollar amounts, or timeframes

2. **Negativity Bias**
   - [ ] Highlights potential loss or mistake
   - [ ] Warns of consequences

3. **Pattern Interrupt**
   - [ ] Challenges common belief
   - [ ] Surprises or contradicts expectations

4. **Target Callout**
   - [ ] Directly addresses specific audience
   - [ ] Names them explicitly when appropriate

5. **Problem Callout**
   - [ ] Identifies common pain point immediately
   - [ ] Names the struggle specifically

6. **Confidence and Conviction**
   - [ ] Uses strong, assertive language
   - [ ] Eliminates hedge words (maybe, might, could)

7. **Aesthetics**
   - [ ] Visually clean and scannable
   - [ ] Line breaks in right places

8. **Potential Benefit**
   - [ ] Clearly states what reader will gain
   - [ ] Focuses on outcome, not just process

9. **Social Proof**
   - [ ] Leverages authority or popularity when relevant
   - [ ] References results, credentials, or validation

10. **Warning and Caution**
    - [ ] Creates urgency or importance
    - [ ] Suggests reader might be missing out

**Aim for 4-6 commandments per hook** for strong performance.

#### Step 3: Test with The 4 U's

Evaluate your top 3-5 options:

1. **Useful** - Does it offer clear value?
2. **Urgent** - Does it compel immediate action/attention?
3. **Unique** - Does it stand out from similar content?
4. **Ultra-specific** - Is it concrete (not vague)?

**Example of all 4 U's working:**
"7 Little-Known SEO Tricks to Boost Your Traffic by 204% in Just 30 Days"

- ✅ Useful: SEO tricks that boost traffic
- ✅ Urgent: "Just 30 days" creates timeframe
- ✅ Unique: "Little-known" implies non-obvious
- ✅ Ultra-specific: "204%" and "7 tricks" are concrete

**Quality threshold:** Score 3/4 or 4/4 on the U's.

#### Step 4: Final Selection Using Anatomy Criteria

Rate each finalist 1-5 on:

1. **Clarity** - Main point immediately clear?
2. **Specificity** - Concrete information or promise?
3. **Urgency** - Compels immediate action/interest?
4. **Uniqueness** - Stands out from competitors?
5. **Relevance** - Aligns with target audience's interests?

**Minimum passing score:** 20/25 total
**Aim for:** 22-25/25 for high performance

#### Step 5: "Become the Reader" Final Check

Before finalizing:
- [ ] **"What's in it for me?"** - Is the benefit crystal clear?
- [ ] **Too abstract?** - Can I picture what this promises?
- [ ] **Would I stop scrolling?** - Honest answer
- [ ] **Does it make sense standalone?** - Or does it need more context?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Ideation Issues
❌ **Surface-level questioning** - Stopping at first "why"
❌ **Too abstract** - Can't visualize what you're promising
❌ **Missing transformation** - No clear before → after

### Formula Issues
❌ **First-match bias** - Using first formula that fits
❌ **Formula drift** - Abandoning structure mid-hook
❌ **Overcomplication** - Trying to say too much

### Optimization Issues
❌ **Skipping volume** - Writing 2-3 instead of 10+
❌ **Hedge words** - "Maybe," "might," "could" (kills conviction)
❌ **Generic promises** - "Boost productivity" vs "Double your output in 30 days"

### Selection Issues
❌ **Gut-based selection** - Picking favorite without criteria
❌ **Ignoring reader perspective** - Benefit unclear
❌ **Clickbait** - Promise you can't fulfill (destroys trust)
