## Who is the I?

I-types are enthusiastic, cheerful, and outgoing people who draw energy from social interaction and genuinely enjoy connecting with others. They have a relaxed, casual communication style and an intuitive understanding of group dynamics. What matters most to them is relationships, personal connection, and making others feel valued -- they prioritize people and ideas over tasks and process.

## Do's

- Match their energy and enthusiasm. Be animated, warm, and expressive.
- Allow conversations to flow organically rather than sticking rigidly to an agenda.
- Use humor, share personal anecdotes, and build rapport before diving into business.
- Frame requests in terms of how they'll help people or contribute to team success.
- Give them public recognition for their contributions.
- Keep communication casual and friendly -- video calls or in-person meetings work best.
- Offer creative freedom and opportunities to brainstorm collaboratively.
- Focus on the big picture and exciting possibilities before details.

## Don'ts

- Don't be cold, formal, or overly structured in your communication.
- Don't bury them in data-heavy reports or excessive detail without context.
- Don't micromanage or impose rigid, predictable routines on them.
- Don't force them to work in isolation for extended periods.
- Don't nitpick details when giving feedback -- focus on the big picture.
- Don't use purely written communication when face-to-face is possible.
- Don't ignore the relationship and jump straight to tasks.
- Don't publicly criticize them -- they're sensitive to losing approval.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Whenever possible, meet in person or via video call. I-types pick up on facial expressions and tone of voice, and communicate better when they can see reactions in real-time. Keep agendas flexible and allow time for personal connection before diving into business. Keep meetings casual and interactive.

### Email
Keep messages warm and personal. A brief friendly opening goes a long way. Be clear about what you need, but frame requests positively. Include a specific call-to-action, as I-types respond better to clear next steps than open-ended requests.

### Giving Feedback
Lead with what's working before addressing areas for improvement. Focus on the big picture rather than nitpicking details, and frame feedback as opportunities for growth rather than failures. Public recognition for contributions goes a long way with this type.

### Resolving Conflict
I-types often avoid conflict, hoping problems will resolve themselves. Address issues directly but gently. Acknowledge the relationship first, then discuss the problem. Avoid blame and focus on finding solutions together. Give them space to process emotions, and don't mistake their desire to smooth things over for genuine resolution.

- Group discussions and brainstorming sessions
- Encouraging others and sharing stories
