# Landing Page Audit

Evaluate landing pages for conversion optimization.

## Process

### Step 1: Analyze Headline-Ad Alignment

**Scent Trail Check**
- Does headline match ad hook?
- Is the promise consistent?
- Same language/tone as ad?
- Visual continuity from ad to page?

**Message Match Score**
- Strong: Exact phrase/promise carried through
- Moderate: Similar theme, different words
- Weak: Disconnect between ad and page

### Step 2: Check Promise-Delivery Consistency

**Above the Fold**
- Is main promise clear immediately?
- Does headline address primary pain/desire?
- Is there a clear value proposition?
- Does subheadline support headline?

**Body Content**
- Does content deliver on headline promise?
- Are claims substantiated with proof?
- Is there a logical flow to the argument?
- Does unique mechanism get explained?

### Step 3: Evaluate Trust Signals

**Social Proof**
- Customer testimonials (video > text)
- Review counts/ratings
- Customer photos
- Before/after images
- Case studies

**Authority Signals**
- Expert endorsements
- Certifications/credentials
- Media mentions (as seen in...)
- Scientific backing
- Founder credibility

**Risk Reversal**
- Money-back guarantee
- Free trial
- No-commitment language
- Contact information visible

### Step 4: Identify Friction Points

**Visual Friction**
- Cluttered layout
- Hard to read text
- Poor mobile experience
- Slow loading elements
- Confusing navigation

**Cognitive Friction**
- Too many choices
- Unclear next step
- Missing information
- Jargon/complexity
- Unanswered objections

**Form Friction**
- Too many fields
- Unclear field labels
- No progress indicator
- Privacy concerns
- Submit button unclear
