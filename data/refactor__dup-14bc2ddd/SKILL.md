# Code Refactoring Skill

A systematic approach to refactoring code based on Martin Fowler's *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code* (2nd Edition). This skill emphasizes safe, incremental changes backed by tests.

> "Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure." — Martin Fowler

## Core Principles

1. **Behavior Preservation**: External behavior must remain unchanged
2. **Small Steps**: Make tiny, testable changes
3. **Test-Driven**: Tests are the safety net
4. **Continuous**: Refactoring is ongoing, not a one-time event
5. **Collaborative**: User approval required at each phase

## Phase 1: Research & Analysis

### Objectives
- Understand the codebase structure and purpose
- Identify the scope of refactoring
- Gather context about business requirements

### Questions to Ask User
Before starting, clarify:

1. **Scope**: Which files/modules/functions need refactoring?
2. **Goals**: What problems are you trying to solve? (readability, performance, maintainability)
3. **Constraints**: Are there any areas that should NOT be changed?
4. **Timeline pressure**: Is this blocking other work?
5. **Test status**: Do tests exist? Are they passing?

### Actions
- [ ] Read and understand the target code
- [ ] Identify dependencies and integrations
- [ ] Document current architecture
- [ ] Note any existing technical debt markers (TODOs, FIXMEs)

### Output
Present findings to user:
- Code structure summary
- Identified problem areas
- Initial recommendations
- **Request approval to proceed**

---

## Phase 2: Test Coverage Assessment

### Why Tests Matter
> "Refactoring without tests is like driving without a seatbelt." — Martin Fowler

Tests are the **key enabler** of safe refactoring. Without them, you risk introducing bugs.

### Assessment Steps

1. **Check for existing tests**
   ```bash
   # Look for test files
   find . -name "*test*" -o -name "*spec*" | head -20
   ```

2. **Run existing tests**
   ```bash
   # JavaScript/TypeScript
   npm test

   # Python
   pytest -v

   # Java
   mvn test
   ```

3. **Check coverage (if available)**
   ```bash
   # JavaScript
   npm run test:coverage

   # Python
   pytest --cov=.
   ```

### Decision Point: Ask User

**If tests exist and pass:**
- Proceed to Phase 3

**If tests are missing or incomplete:**
Present options:
1. Write tests first (recommended)
2. Add tests incrementally during refactoring
3. Proceed without tests (risky - requires user acknowledgment)

**If tests are failing:**
- STOP. Fix failing tests before refactoring
- Ask user: Should we fix tests first?

### Test Writing Guidelines (if needed)

For each function being refactored, ensure tests cover:
- Happy path (normal operation)
- Edge cases (empty inputs, null, boundaries)
- Error scenarios (invalid inputs, exceptions)

Use the "red-green-refactor" cycle:
1. Write failing test (red)
2. Make it pass (green)
3. Refactor

## Phase 3: Code Smell Identification

### What Are Code Smells?
Symptoms of deeper problems in code. They're not bugs, but indicators that the code could be improved.

### Common Code Smells to Check

See [references/code-smells.md](references/code-smells.md) for the complete catalog.

#### Quick Reference

| Smell | Signs | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Long Method** | Methods > 30-50 lines | Hard to understand, test, maintain |
| **Duplicated Code** | Same logic in multiple places | Bug fixes needed in multiple places |
| **Large Class** | Class with too many responsibilities | Violates Single Responsibility |
| **Feature Envy** | Method uses another class's data more | Poor encapsulation |
| **Primitive Obsession** | Overuse of primitives instead of objects | Missing domain concepts |
| **Long Parameter List** | Methods with 4+ parameters | Hard to call correctly |
| **Data Clumps** | Same data items appearing together | Missing abstraction |
| **Switch Statements** | Complex switch/if-else chains | Hard to extend |
| **Speculative Generality** | Code "just in case" | Unnecessary complexity |
| **Dead Code** | Unused code | Confusion, maintenance burden |

### Analysis Steps

1. **Automated Analysis** (if scripts available)
   ```bash
   python scripts/detect-smells.py <file>
   ```

2. **Manual Review**
   - Walk through code systematically
   - Note each smell with location and severity
   - Categorize by impact (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

3. **Prioritization**
   Focus on smells that:
   - Block current development
   - Cause bugs or confusion
   - Affect most-changed code paths

### Output: Smell Report

Present to user:
- List of identified smells with locations
- Severity assessment for each
- Recommended priority order
- **Request approval on priorities**

---

## Phase 4: Refactoring Plan Creation

### Selecting Refactorings

For each smell, select an appropriate refactoring from the catalog.

See [references/refactoring-catalog.md](references/refactoring-catalog.md) for the complete list.

#### Smell-to-Refactoring Mapping

| Code Smell | Recommended Refactoring(s) |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Long Method | Extract Method, Replace Temp with Query |
| Duplicated Code | Extract Method, Pull Up Method, Form Template Method |
| Large Class | Extract Class, Extract Subclass |
| Feature Envy | Move Method, Move Field |
| Primitive Obsession | Replace Primitive with Object, Replace Type Code with Class |
| Long Parameter List | Introduce Parameter Object, Preserve Whole Object |
| Data Clumps | Extract Class, Introduce Parameter Object |
| Switch Statements | Replace Conditional with Polymorphism |
| Speculative Generality | Collapse Hierarchy, Inline Class, Remove Dead Code |
| Dead Code | Remove Dead Code |

### Plan Structure

Use the template at [templates/refactoring-plan.md](templates/refactoring-plan.md).

For each refactoring:
1. **Target**: What code will change
2. **Smell**: What problem it addresses
3. **Refactoring**: Which technique to apply
4. **Steps**: Detailed micro-steps
5. **Risks**: What could go wrong
6. **Rollback**: How to undo if needed

### Phased Approach

**CRITICAL**: Introduce refactoring gradually in phases.

**Phase A: Quick Wins** (Low risk, high value)
- Rename variables for clarity
- Extract obvious duplicate code
- Remove dead code

**Phase B: Structural Improvements** (Medium risk)
- Extract methods from long functions
- Introduce parameter objects
- Move methods to appropriate classes

**Phase C: Architectural Changes** (Higher risk)
- Replace conditionals with polymorphism
- Extract classes
- Introduce design patterns

### Decision Point: Present Plan to User

Before implementation:
- Show complete refactoring plan
- Explain each phase and its risks
- Get explicit approval for each phase
- **Ask**: "Should I proceed with Phase A?"

---

## Phase 5: Incremental Implementation

### The Golden Rule
> "Change → Test → Green? → Commit → Next step"

### Implementation Rhythm

For each refactoring step:

1. **Pre-check**
   - Tests are passing (green)
   - Code compiles

2. **Make ONE small change**
   - Follow the mechanics from the catalog
   - Keep changes minimal

3. **Verify**
   - Run tests immediately
   - Check for compilation errors

4. **If tests pass (green)**
   - Commit with descriptive message
   - Move to next step

5. **If tests fail (red)**
   - STOP immediately
   - Undo the change
   - Analyze what went wrong
   - Ask user if unclear

### Commit Strategy

Each commit should be:
- **Atomic**: One logical change
- **Reversible**: Easy to revert
- **Descriptive**: Clear commit message

Example commit messages:
```
refactor: Extract calculateTotal() from processOrder()
refactor: Rename 'x' to 'customerCount' for clarity
refactor: Remove unused validateOldFormat() method
```

### Progress Reporting

After each sub-phase, report to user:
- Changes made
- Tests still passing?
- Any issues encountered
- **Ask**: "Continue with next batch?"

---

## Phase 6: Review & Iteration

### Post-Refactoring Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No new warnings/errors
- [ ] Code compiles successfully
- [ ] Behavior unchanged (manual verification)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Commit history is clean

### Metrics Comparison

Run complexity analysis before and after:
```bash
python scripts/analyze-complexity.py <file>
```

Present improvements:
- Lines of code change
- Cyclomatic complexity change
- Maintainability index change

### User Review

Present final results:
- Summary of all changes
- Before/after code comparison
- Metrics improvements
- Remaining technical debt
- **Ask**: "Are you satisfied with these changes?"

### Next Steps

Discuss with user:
- Additional smells to address?
- Schedule follow-up refactoring?
- Apply similar changes elsewhere?

---

## Important Guidelines

### When to STOP and Ask

Always pause and consult user when:
- Unsure about business logic
- Change might affect external APIs
- Test coverage is inadequate
- Significant architectural decision needed
- Risk level increases
- You encounter unexpected complexity

### Safety Rules

1. **Never refactor without tests** (unless user explicitly acknowledges risk)
2. **Never make big changes** - break into tiny steps
3. **Never skip the test run** after each change
4. **Never continue if tests fail** - fix or rollback first
5. **Never assume** - when in doubt, ask

### What NOT to Do

- Don't combine refactoring with feature additions
- Don't refactor during production emergencies
- Don't refactor code you don't understand
- Don't over-engineer - keep it simple
- Don't refactor everything at once

---

## Quick Start Example

### Scenario: Long Method with Duplication

**Before:**
```javascript
function processOrder(order) {
  // 150 lines of code with:
  // - Duplicated validation logic
  // - Inline calculations
  // - Mixed responsibilities
}
```

**Refactoring Steps:**

1. **Ensure tests exist** for processOrder()
2. **Extract** validation into validateOrder()
3. **Test** - should pass
4. **Extract** calculation into calculateOrderTotal()
5. **Test** - should pass
6. **Extract** notification into notifyCustomer()
7. **Test** - should pass
8. **Review** - processOrder() now orchestrates 3 clear functions

**After:**
```javascript
function processOrder(order) {
  validateOrder(order);
  const total = calculateOrderTotal(order);
  notifyCustomer(order, total);
  return { order, total };
}
```
