# Mendix Microflow Skill

## Reference files

`SKILL.md` covers the shape of a microflow and the decisions. The detail lives beside it:

- [`reference/control-flow.md`](reference/control-flow.md) — every form of `if`,
  `case`, `split type`, `loop` and `while`, plus error handling (`try`/custom
  handlers) and the `@position` / `@merge` / `@anchor` activity annotations.
- [`reference/data-operations.md`](reference/data-operations.md) — create, change,
  commit, delete; list operations and aggregates; `retrieve` from database,
  association and list; XPath navigation.
- [`reference/integration.md`](reference/integration.md) — `rest call` and
  `send rest request`, legacy SOAP, calling Java actions (including the `empty`
  argument and microflow-typed parameters), `execute database query`, file downloads.
- [`reference/pitfalls.md`](reference/pitfalls.md) — **read this when
  `mxcli check` rejects something you believe is correct.** The anti-patterns, the
  CE0111 duplicate-variable trap, the syntax that looks plausible and does not
  parse, and the Studio Pro errors each one produces.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Writing CREATE MICROFLOW statements
- Debugging microflow syntax errors
- Converting Studio Pro microflows to MDL
- Understanding microflow control flow and structure

If you're not sure whether the logic belongs in a microflow or a nanoflow, read the next section first. The mirror lives in [write-nanoflows](../write-nanoflows/SKILL.md) — keep both copies in sync.

## Changing an Existing Microflow

Choose the mode by who owns the microflow ([choose-edit-mode](../choose-edit-mode/SKILL.md)):

- **Created by your MDL scripts, and not edited in Studio Pro since:** edit the script
  (or fresh `describe` output) and re-run `create or modify`.
- **Authored in Studio Pro:** prefer `alter microflow X { insert/replace/drop … }`
  (targets from `describe microflow X with handles`). `create or modify` of `describe`
  output patches too: unchanged writes nothing; a statement (even one whose handler returns), guard
  clause, `return` value, `if` condition, header clause, parameter (added/retyped; removed only if unused) or stated `@position`/`@start` change is
  patched in place (a move keeps the node's flows). A redrawn `@anchor`/`@curve`, loop body,
  error handler or other `return` added/taken away rebuilds under mdl 0 (`MDL-V1-REBUILD`: IDs
  renumbered, merges and curves lost) and is refused under `mdl 1;`. **To change a loop body, `alter … replace` the whole loop** — neither mode edits inside one ([pitfalls](reference/pitfalls.md#11-changing-something-inside-a-loop-body)). **To rebuild deliberately, `drop` and `create` in ONE script** — the grants carry only within it ([pitfalls](reference/pitfalls.md#drop--create-is-still-a-new-document)).

## When to Use a Microflow vs a Nanoflow

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Querying the database | Microflow |
| Calling REST services or external actions | Microflow |
| Running Java actions | Microflow |
| File generation or download | Microflow |
| Transactional commits (rollback on error) | Microflow |
| Background scheduled logic | Microflow |
| Client-side form validation before save | Nanoflow |
| UI navigation and page routing | Nanoflow |
| Calling device features (GPS, phone, camera) | Nanoflow |
| Offline data access and local storage | Nanoflow |
| Calling JavaScript actions (NanoflowCommons) | Nanoflow |
| Showing progress indicators / confirmation dialogs | Nanoflow |

**Rule of thumb:** A nanoflow runs before the server call. A microflow IS the server call.

## Key Differences from Nanoflows

| Aspect | Microflow | Nanoflow |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Execution** | Server-side | Client-side (browser/mobile) |
| **Database access** | Full | No direct access |
| **Transactions** | Supported | Not supported |
| **Java actions** | Supported | Not supported |
| **JavaScript actions** | Not supported | Supported |
| **SYNCHRONIZE** | Not available | Available (offline sync) |
| **File downloads** | Supported | Not supported |
| **Error handling** | Full `ON ERROR` blocks; `RAISE ERROR` **inside a handler only** (main flow = MDL084 / CE0710) | Per-action `ON ERROR` supported; `RAISE ERROR` / `ErrorEvent` forbidden |
| **Offline** | Not available | Available |
| **Binary return type** | Supported | Not supported |

For nanoflow-specific authoring guidance, see [write-nanoflows](../write-nanoflows/SKILL.md).

## Microflow Structure

**CRITICAL: All microflows MUST have JavaDoc-style documentation**

```mdl
/**
 * Microflow description explaining what it does
 *
 * Detailed explanation of the business logic, use cases,
 * and any important implementation notes.
 *
 * @param $Parameter1 Description of first parameter
 * @param $Parameter2 Description of second parameter
 * @returns Description of return value
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @author Team Name
 */
create microflow Module.MicroflowName (
  $Parameter1: type,
  $Parameter2: type
)
returns ReturnType as $ReturnVariable
[folder 'FolderPath']
begin
  -- Microflow logic here
  return $ReturnVariable;
end;
```

### `exposed as … action` — putting a microflow in the toolbox

Studio Pro can show a microflow in its toolbox, so whoever drags it onto a flow
does not need to know it is a microflow rather than a Java action. A microflow
has **two** such entries — one for the microflow editor, one for the workflow
editor — so the clause names which:

```mdl
mdl 1;
create microflow Module.FormatCode ($Raw: String)
returns String
exposed as microflow action 'Format code' in 'Toolbox demo'
  icon 'assets/format-64.png'
  icon dark 'assets/format-64-dark.png'
  image 'assets/format-256.png'
exposed as workflow action 'Format code' in 'Toolbox demo'
begin
  return trim($Raw);
end;
```

The icon should be a **64x64** PNG and the image **256x192**; paths resolve
against the directory of the .mdl file, so a script and its artwork travel
together. A different size is written with a warning; a
file that is not a PNG is refused.

**An omitted clause preserves what is stored — it does not clear it:**

| You write | What happens |
|---|---|
| `exposed as microflow action 'X' in 'Y'` | Caption and category from MDL; **icon and image carried** from what was stored |
| *(no clause)* | Both entries **preserved**, bitmaps included |
| `not exposed as workflow action` | Removes that one entry; the microflow entry is untouched |
| `… drop icon dark` | Clears one bitmap; the other three are untouched |

Rewriting a microflow's body must not cost it the icon a designer set in Studio
Pro, and saying nothing about the toolbox is not asking to be taken out of it.
Nothing below Studio Pro sees the difference — `mx check` reports 0 errors
either way — so the preserve rule is the only thing protecting it.

**Nanoflows and rules cannot be exposed.** Only `Microflows$Microflow` stores a
toolbox entry; the clause is refused on the other two with a message naming the
alternative. Java and JavaScript actions have one entry each and use the shorter
`exposed as 'Caption' in 'Category'` — see the `java-actions` skill.

### `@excluded` — documents excluded from the project

`@excluded` before a `create microflow` marks the document **"Exclude from project"**
(the same checkbox Studio Pro offers). The document stays in the `.mpr`, does not
build, and `list microflows` reports it in the `Excluded` column.

```mdl
mdl 1;
@excluded
create microflow MyModule.LegacyCalc ()
returns Integer
begin
  return 7;
end;
```

The sibling document annotation is **`@applyentityaccess`** — runs the flow under the current user's entity access rules rather than with full access, with the same absent-preserves rule and an explicit `(false)` to turn it off ([pitfalls](reference/pitfalls.md#apply-entity-access)).

Two rules follow, and both are enforced rather than documented-and-hoped:

- **An absent `@excluded` never un-excludes.** It means "the script does not say",
  not "make this active" — so re-running a `create or modify` you wrote before the
  document was excluded leaves the exclusion alone. Un-exclude in Studio Pro.
  (Before #914 the rewrite cleared it, which is how a valid project ended up
  failing **CE0122** — see the next rule.)
- **A name is not unique when a twin is excluded.** Mendix allows two documents of
  the same name in one module as long as at most one is active — verified on
  11.13.0: the excluded pair builds at 0 errors, the same pair both active is
  `[error] CE0122 "Duplicate document name"`. `create or modify`, `describe` and
  the other by-name lookups therefore target the **live** document; the excluded
  twin is neither rewritten nor deleted.

The same applies to every document type that carries the flag — nanoflows, pages,
snippets, enumerations, queues, workflows, Java/JavaScript actions, mappings, JSON
structures, REST/OData services, image collections and the agent documents.

### FOLDER Option

Place microflows in folders for organization:

```mdl
mdl 1;
create microflow MyModule.ACT_ProcessOrder ($Order: MyModule.Order)
returns boolean as $success
folder 'Orders/Processing'
begin
  -- logic
  return true;
end;
```

**Key Rules:**
- Parameters start with `$` prefix
- Return variable must be declared or used
- Every microflow must end with `return` statement
- Every body statement ends with a semicolon `;` — **required**, not optional. This
  includes block terminators: `end if;`, `end loop;`, `end while;`, `end case;`.
  A missing one is a parse error (`missing ';' at 'return'`), not a warning.
- Microflow ends with `/` separator

### Parameter Types

```mdl
-- Primitive types
$Name: string
$count: integer
$Amount: decimal
$IsActive: boolean
$date: datetime

-- Entity types
$Customer: Module.Entity

-- List types
$ProductList: list of Module.Product

-- Enumeration types
$status: enum Module.OrderStatus
```

## Variable Declarations

### ✅ CORRECT Syntax

```mdl
-- Primitive types with initialization
declare $Counter integer = 0;
declare $message string = 'Hello';
declare $IsValid boolean = true;
declare $Today datetime = [%CurrentDateTime%];
declare $status Enumeration(Module.OrderStatus) = Module.OrderStatus.Open;
```

> **You cannot `declare` an object (entity) variable.** `declare` becomes a
> *Create Variable* activity, which Mendix only allows to hold **primitive** types
> (String, Integer/Long, Decimal, Boolean, DateTime, Enumeration). An object type
> is rejected by Studio Pro/mxbuild with CE0053 ("Selected type is not allowed"),
> plus CE0038 ("Value required") and CE7247 on any following `set` — whether or
> not you give it an initializer. `mxcli check` now flags it as **MDL043**. There
> is **no** "empty object variable" activity. Get objects from one of these:
> - a microflow **parameter**: `create microflow M.Save ($Product: Test.Product) ...`
> - a **retrieve**: `retrieve $Product from Test.Product where Code = $c first;`
> - a **create object**: `$Product = create Test.Product (Name = $n);`
> - a **loop iterator**: `loop $Product in $Products ...`

> **You cannot `declare` a list either.** Same *Create Variable* restriction —
> Studio Pro rejects a list with CE0053/CE0038, and `mxcli check` flags it as
> **MDL040**. Get lists from:
> - a microflow **parameter**: `create microflow M.Process ($Items: list of Test.Product) ...`
> - a **retrieve**: `retrieve $Products from Test.Product where IsActive = true;`
> - a **create list**: `$Products = create list of Test.Product;`

> **Decimal values into an `integer`/`long` fail CE0117.** Integer division
> (`$a div $b`) is always a Decimal even for two integers, and so are `random()`
> and the duration `*Between` functions (`secondsBetween`, `minutesBetween`,
> `hoursBetween`, `daysBetween`, `weeksBetween`). Assigning any of them straight
> to an `integer`/`long` variable fails `mx check` with **CE0117** (`mxcli check`
> now flags it as **MDL041**). Either declare the target `decimal`, or round it:
> ```mdl
> declare $Avg decimal = $Total div $Count;          -- ✅ Decimal target
> declare $Whole integer = round($Total div $Count); -- ✅ rounded to Integer
> declare $Secs integer = round(secondsBetween($a,$b)); -- ✅ rounded to Integer
> declare $Bad integer = $Total div $Count;          -- ❌ CE0117 / MDL041
> ```
> The `calendar*Between` functions (`calendarMonthsBetween`, `calendarYearsBetween`)
> return whole units (Integer) and are fine to assign directly.

### Changing a variable: always `set`

`set $Counter = $Counter + 1;` changes a variable. `$x = …` without `set` is an
activity that creates `$x` — required under `mdl 1;` (`MDL-V1-SET` otherwise).
List operations and aggregates are one statement per activity and never nest:
`$Open = filter $Orders by Status = M.Status.Open;` then `$N = count $Open;` —
see [`reference/data-operations.md`](reference/data-operations.md#one-statement-per-activity).

### ❌ INCORRECT Syntax

```mdl
-- WRONG: Declaring an object/entity variable (CE0053/CE0038, MDL043)
declare $Product Test.Product;            -- bare object declare is invalid
declare $Product Test.Product = $someObj; -- initialized object declare is also invalid

-- WRONG: Declaring a list variable (CE0053/CE0038, MDL040)
declare $ProductList list of Test.Product = empty;  -- use a parameter, retrieve, or create list

-- WRONG: Using AS keyword (not supported in mxcli)
declare $Product as Test.Product;  -- ERROR: parse error

-- WRONG: No value (CE0038, MDL061)
declare $X string;  -- a Create Variable activity requires a value

-- WRONG: Missing type
declare $Counter = 0;  -- Type inference not always supported

-- WRONG: Using 'OF' instead of 'of'
declare $list list of Test.Product;  -- Case sensitive
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic

```mdl
set $Result = $A + $B;      -- Addition
set $Result = $A - $B;      -- Subtraction
set $Result = $A * $B;      -- Multiplication
set $Result = $A div $B;    -- Division (use 'div', not '/')
```

**Important**: Use `div` for division, NOT `/`. In a Mendix expression `/` is the
member/association separator (`$obj/Attr`), so `$A / $B` is not division —
`mxcli check` rejects it as **MDL045** (it would fail the build with CE0117).
Integer/decimal division always yields a Decimal; wrap it in `round()`/`trunc()`
for an Integer result (else **MDL041**).

### Comparison

```mdl
$A = $B       -- Equals
$A != $B      -- Not equals
$A > $B       -- Greater than
$A >= $B      -- Greater than or equal
$A < $B       -- Less than
$A <= $B      -- Less than or equal
$A = empty    -- Check if empty/null
$A != empty   -- Check if not empty
```

### Boolean Logic

```mdl
set $Result = $A and $B;    -- Logical AND
set $Result = $A or $B;     -- Logical OR
set $Result = not $A;       -- Logical NOT

-- Complex expressions
if $IsActive and $IsValid and $HasStock then
  set $CanProcess = true;
end if;
```

### Date construction

`dateTime(...)` / `dateTimeUTC(...)` build a date from **literal numeric
constants only** — a variable or computed argument fails the build with CE0117
(`mxcli check` flags it as **MDL046**). To build a date from variables, step off
a literal anchor with `addDays()` / `addMonths()` (which *do* take variables):

```mdl
-- WRONG: variable args to dateTime() (CE0117 / MDL046)
set $D = dateTime(2026, $Month, $Day);

-- RIGHT: anchor on a literal, then step with addMonths/addDays
set $D = addDays(addMonths(dateTime(2026, 1, 1), $Month - 1), $Day - 1);
```

## Logging

```mdl
-- Log levels
log info 'Information message';
log warning 'Warning message';
log error 'Error message';

-- With node name
log info node 'OrderService' 'Processing order';
log warning node 'ValidationService' 'Invalid data detected';

-- With variables (use concatenation)
log info node 'OrderService' 'Order processed: ' + $OrderNumber;
log error node 'Service' 'Error: ' + $ErrorMessage;
```

## Special Values

```mdl
empty                      -- Null/empty value
[%CurrentDateTime%]        -- Current date/time
[%CurrentUser%]            -- Current user object
toString($value)           -- Convert to string
```

> **No `randomInt`.** Mendix has no `randomInt` function. Use `random()` (returns a
> Decimal in [0,1)) and round to an integer range — e.g. a value in 0..8 is
> `round(random() * 8)`. Because `random()` is a Decimal, assigning it (or `div`,
> `secondsBetween()`, and the other duration `*Between` functions) directly to an
> `integer` variable fails the build with CE0117 — wrap it in `round()`/`floor()`/`ceil()`.
> `mxcli check` now flags an unknown expression function like `randomInt` as
> **MDL044** (with a "did you mean random()?" hint), and a Decimal assigned to an
> integer target as **MDL041** — before the build does.
>
> **MDL044 also blocks `mxcli exec`**, not just `check`: a call to a name Mendix
> has no built-in for is CE0117 at build time, so exec refuses to write the
> microflow or nanoflow (log messages included). Not real: `currentDeviceType()`,
> `[%CurrentDeviceType%]` (a CE0117 `check` misses) and `trunc()` (use
> `round`/`floor`/`ceil`). If exec rejects a function you believe IS a Mendix
> built-in, build it once and — if mxbuild accepts it — add it to `funcTable` in
> `mdl/exprcheck/func_checker.go`; that table is the rule's only allow-list.

## Complete Example

```mdl
mdl 1;
/**
 * Process order with validation and status update.
 *
 * @param $OrderNumber The order to process
 * @returns true when the order was found and marked processed
 */
create microflow Shop.ProcessOrder (
  $OrderNumber: string
)
returns boolean as $success
begin
  declare $success boolean = false;

  -- Find the order (the retrieve establishes $Order — objects are never declared)
  retrieve $Order from Shop.Order
    where OrderNumber = $OrderNumber;

  -- Validate order exists
  if $Order = empty then
    log warning node 'OrderService' 'Order not found: ' + $OrderNumber;
    return false;
  end if;

  -- Validate customer association
  if $Order/Shop.Order_Customer = empty then
    log error node 'OrderService' 'Order has no customer';
    return false;
  end if;

  -- Update order status
  change $Order (
    status = 'PROCESSING',
    ProcessedDate = [%CurrentDateTime%]);

  commit $Order;

  -- Log success
  log info node 'OrderService' 'Order processed: ' + $OrderNumber;
  set $success = true;
  return $success;
end;
```

## Calling Microflows

### ✅ CORRECT Syntax

```mdl
-- Call with result assignment (no SET keyword)
$Result = call microflow Module.ProcessOrder(Order = $Order);

-- Call without result (void microflow)
call microflow Module.SendNotification(message = $message);

-- Call with error handling
$Result = call microflow Module.ExternalService(data = $data) on error continue;

-- Run the call on a task queue (background execution). The clause goes after
-- the arguments and before any ON ERROR, and works on CALL JAVA ACTION too.
call microflow Module.ACT_Refresh() in queue Module.RefreshQueue;
call java action Module.RefreshData(Url = $Url) in queue Module.RefreshQueue;
```

**Queued calls** — the queue must already exist (`create task queue Module.RefreshQueue
(Parallelism: 2)`), and the called flow must return nothing: a queued
**microflow with a `returns` clause** fails the build with CE7033 (`mxcli check`:
MDL088), a queued **Java action must `returns void`** or it fails with CE7038. Rewriting a microflow that has a queued call must restate the
`in queue` clause; a rewrite that omits it is refused rather than silently
dropping the binding. See `.claude/skills/mendix/scheduled-events-and-queues`.

### ❌ INCORRECT Syntax

```mdl
-- WRONG: Do NOT use SET with CALL MICROFLOW
set $Result = call microflow Module.ProcessOrder(Order = $Order);  -- ERROR!

-- CORRECT: Direct variable assignment
$Result = call microflow Module.ProcessOrder(Order = $Order);
```

**Important**: The `set` keyword is for changing existing variable values, NOT for capturing microflow return values. Use direct assignment (`$var = call microflow ...`).

### Parameter Name Matching

**CRITICAL**: Parameter names in `call microflow` must **exactly match** the parameter names declared in the target microflow's signature (without the `$` prefix). A mismatch causes a build error (MxBuild) but may fail silently at MDL execution time.

```mdl
-- Target microflow declaration:
create microflow Module.SendEmail ($Recipient: string, $Subject: string)
begin ... end;

-- CORRECT: parameter names match the declaration
call microflow Module.SendEmail(Recipient = $Email, Subject = $title);

-- WRONG: parameter name does not match (EmailAddress vs Recipient)
call microflow Module.SendEmail(EmailAddress = $Email, Subject = $title);  -- BUILD ERROR!
```

When calling microflows, always check the target's parameter list. Use `describe microflow Module.Name` to see the exact parameter names.

## Page Navigation

### SHOW PAGE

```mdl
-- Open page with parameter
show page Module.EditPage(Product = $Product);
```

Every call site binds an argument as `Param = expression`, with no `$` on the
parameter name: `call microflow`, `show page`, and widget actions
(`action: show page Module.Page(Param = $value)`) alike. `$Param = $value` and
`Param: $value` still parse but are deprecated (MDL-DEPR006/007); `mxcli fmt
--upgrade` rewrites them.

### CLOSE PAGE

```mdl
close page;
```

### SHOW HOME PAGE

```mdl
show home page;
```

## Validation Checklist

Before executing a microflow script, verify:

- [ ] **No object (entity) or list is `declare`d** — objects come from a parameter, retrieve, create object, or loop iterator (MDL043); lists from a parameter, retrieve, or create list (MDL040)
- [ ] **All primitive variables are declared before SET** (`declare $var type = value;`)
- [ ] XPath association navigation uses qualified names (`Module.AssociationName`)
- [ ] All referenced attributes exist in entity definitions
- [ ] Every flow path ends with `return`
- [ ] No code appears after `return` statements
- [ ] Division uses `div` operator (not `/`)
- [ ] All entity/association names are fully qualified
- [ ] **CALL MICROFLOW parameter names exactly match target signature** (use `describe microflow` to verify)
- [ ] Microflow ends with `/` separator
- [ ] Parameters start with `$` prefix
- [ ] Proper closing for control structures (`end if`, `end loop`)

## Tips for Success

1. **Always use fully qualified names**: `Module.Entity`, `Module.Association`
2. **Test incrementally**: Create simple microflows first, then add complexity
3. **Check entity definitions**: Ensure all attributes exist before referencing
4. **Use meaningful variable names**: `$Customer` not `$c`, `$ProductList` not `$list`
5. **Comment complex logic**: Use `--` for inline comments
6. **Log important events**: Help with debugging and auditing
7. **Handle empty cases**: Check for `= empty` before using objects
8. **Use WITHOUT EVENTS appropriately**: Only when handlers must be skipped (events are on by default)
9. **Validate before executing**: Use `mxcli check script.mdl -p app.mpr --references` to catch errors

## Quick Reference

### Variable Declaration Pattern
```mdl
declare $primitive type = value;              -- Primitives (String/Integer/Decimal/Boolean/DateTime)
declare $status Enumeration(Module.Enum) = …; -- Enumerations are primitives too
-- Objects: never declare. Use a parameter, retrieve (… first), `$obj = create Module.Entity(...)`, or a loop iterator.
-- Lists:   never declare. Use a parameter, retrieve, or `$list = create list of Module.Entity;`
```

### Object Operation Pattern
```mdl
$var = create Module.Entity (attr = value);
change $var (attr = value);
commit $var [without events] [refresh];
```

### Flow Control Pattern
```mdl
if condition then ... [else ...] end if;
loop $var in $list begin ... end loop;
return $value;
```

### XPath Pattern
```mdl
$var/attributename                      -- Attribute
$var/Module.AssociationName             -- Association
$var/Module.AssociationName/attribute   -- Chained
```

### Annotation Pattern
```mdl
@position(200, 200)          -- optional: omit it and mxcli lays the flow out; to re-arrange an existing flow run `mxcli layout flows`
@caption 'Persist order'
@color Green
@annotation 'Note about the next activity'
commit $Order;                                          -- Annotations apply here
```

### Annotations Are Notes, and a Note Can Be Shared

A note is a node with edges in Mendix, not a property of the activity it
documents. So `@annotation` is **repeatable** — one activity can carry several,
each its own note — and one note can be attached to several activities:

```mdl
@annotation(id: n1, text: 'both of these touch the same record')
commit $Order;
@annotation(id: n1)                     -- attaches THAT note, does not copy it
commit $Invoice;
```

`id:` is scoped to the flow you are writing and is not stored in the model; it
exists only so a second mention can point at the first. **Without it, two lines
with identical text are two separate notes** — mxcli never merges on text.

A note's own canvas geometry is `position: (x, y)` and `size: (w, h)`, e.g.
`@annotation(text: 'note', position: (175, -40), size: (260, 70))`. Omit them
and the note goes 100px above the activity at 200×50, stacking 60px per extra
note; DESCRIBE omits them again whenever they match, so an ordinary note keeps
the short `@annotation 'text'` form.

### Page Navigation Pattern
```mdl
show page Module.Page(Param = $value);
close page;
show home page;
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```mdl
call microflow ... on error continue;                  -- Ignore error
call microflow ... on error rollback;                  -- Rollback on error
call microflow ... on error begin log ...; return ...; end error;  -- Custom handler
call microflow ... on error without rollback begin ... end error;  -- No rollback
```

The clause goes on whichever activity may fail, not only on calls:

```mdl
declare $Name String = 'default' on error begin return 'could not initialise'; end error;
set $Name = $Other/Name on error begin return 'lookup failed'; end error;
change $Order (Status = Shipped) on error begin log error 'could not ship'; return; end error;
log info node 'App' 'starting' on error begin return; end error;
show message 'saved' on error begin return; end error;

-- BLOCKING halts the client until dismissed; after `objects`, before `on error`.
show message 'Hello {1}' type Warning with ({1} = $Name) blocking;
validation feedback $Order/Total message 'must be positive' on error begin return; end error;
show page Module.Page on error begin return; end error;
close page on error begin return; end error;
```

**Two limits, both reported rather than silently ignored:**

- **`on error continue` is rejected by Mendix** (CE6035) on `create`, `change`,
  `commit`, `log`, `show page`, `close page`, `show message` and
  `validation feedback` — **MDL076**. A custom `{ handler }` is accepted on all
  of them; `continue` is fine on `declare`, `set`, `retrieve`, `delete` and
  `call microflow`. Measured on 11.14.0 — note that create-*variable* and
  change-*variable* accept `continue` while change-*object* does not.
- **List operations and aggregates** (`$x = head $l;`, `$n = count $l;`)
  have no error handling in Mendix at all — **MDL077**.

**In a nanoflow, almost none of them take a clause at all.** `change`, `log`,
`show page`, `close page`, `show message` and `validation feedback` are CE6035
there whichever form is written; only `declare` and `set` accept one. See
`write-nanoflows`.

**End the handler.** A handler body that does not finish with `return` or `throw`
merges back into the main flow, so a variable created *after* the merge point is
out of scope on the error path — CE0108, which Studio Pro reports for the same
model. Ending the handler (as Studio Pro does when you wire it to an end event)
avoids this entirely.
