# Territory Optimization Skill

## When to Use
- Designing new coverage models or rebalancing routes.
- Evaluating fairness metrics during carve-up reviews.
- Preparing leadership readouts on territory effectiveness.

## Framework
1. **Input Prep** – normalize account TAM, ARR, propensity, and travel constraints.
2. **Scenario Modeling** – generate multiple carve-ups (geo, industry, hybrid) with scoring weights.
3. **Fairness Scoring** – calculate Gini, whitespace %, and attainment probability per rep.
4. **Operational Check** – validate CRM ownership, routing rules, and ROE impact.
5. **Recommendation** – surface top options with rationale and risks.

## Templates
- Territory scoring matrix (scenario vs KPIs).
- Leadership readout deck outline.
- Change management checklist for RevOps + Enablement.

## Tips
- Keep scoring weights transparent to avoid stakeholder confusion.
- Include travel/coverage constraints early to prevent downstream rework.
- Pair with `roe-governance` to confirm routing + escalation rules.
