# Space Entities Expert Skill

## Domain Knowledge
- **Files**: `SPACE_ENTITIES.MD`
- **Metadata Format**: YAML blocks with fields: `entity_id`, `name`, `country`, `type`, `specialization`.

## Instructions
1. **Entity Data Collection**: Profile and catalog all commercial, non-profit, and institutional entities in the LORS ecosystem.
2. **Heritage Data Tracking**: Log flight history for each entity, documenting successful operations and failed attempts.
3. **Capability Mapping**: Collect data on entity specializations (e.g., GNC, Power, Robotics).
4. **Source Attribution**: Provide links to official company websites, LinkedIn profiles, or space agency portals for each entity entry.
5. **Product Linking**: For each entity, identify the hardware they develop (landers, rovers, instruments). Link these keywords to the corresponding files in `landers/` or `rovers/` when those files exist.
