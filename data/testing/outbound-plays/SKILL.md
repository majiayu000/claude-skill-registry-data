# Signal-Aligned Outbound Plays Skill

## When to Use
- Launching targeted SDR/AE campaigns triggered by specific topics or product usage events.
- Coordinating multi-channel waves (email, phone, social, executive outreach) rooted in current buying triggers.
- Ensuring messaging references the exact signals that activated the play.

## Framework
1. **Trigger Mapping** – list top signals/topics and the matched play archetype (e.g., “security spike → exec briefing”).
2. **Persona Customization** – define copy blocks, value props, and proof points per persona activated by the signal.
3. **Channel Sequencing** – outline cadence (email → call → social) with timing guidelines based on signal freshness.
4. **Measurement Plan** – capture metrics per channel (reply rate, meeting rate, pipeline impact) and feedback loops.
5. **Escalation Paths** – specify when to escalate to exec sponsor, ABM pod, or customer marketing for references.

## Templates
- Trigger-to-play matrix (signal, persona, playbook, assets needed).
- Outreach sequence script referencing signal language and talk tracks.
- Retro doc capturing performance vs control cohorts.

## Tips
- Reference the exact topic or behavior detected in the first touch to prove relevance.
- Pair with `suppression-logic` to avoid conflicting outreach when customer success or support is active.
- Refresh playbooks quarterly to align with evolving product stories and personas.
