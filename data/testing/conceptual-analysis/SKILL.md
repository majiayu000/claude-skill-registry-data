# Conceptual Analysis Skill

Master the method of analyzing concepts by seeking necessary and sufficient conditions, testing against counterexamples, and refining definitions.

## Overview

### What Is Conceptual Analysis?

The method of clarifying concepts by:
1. Proposing conditions for concept application
2. Testing against cases (real and imagined)
3. Refining based on counterexamples
4. Reaching reflective equilibrium

### The Goal

**Explicit Definition**: X is F iff conditions C₁, C₂, C₃...
- Each condition necessary
- Jointly sufficient
- Captures the concept's extension and intension

---

## The Method

### Step-by-Step Protocol

```
CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
════════════════════════════

1. TARGET IDENTIFICATION
   └── What concept are we analyzing?
   └── Clarify the question ("What is knowledge?")

2. INITIAL ANALYSIS
   └── Propose conditions
   └── Draw on clear cases
   └── State: X is F iff C₁, C₂, C₃...

3. COUNTEREXAMPLE TESTING
   └── Try to imagine cases that:
       ├── Satisfy conditions but aren't F
       └── Are F but don't satisfy conditions

4. REVISION
   └── Modify conditions to handle counterexamples
   └── Add, remove, or revise conditions

5. ITERATION
   └── Repeat steps 3-4 until stable

6. REFLECTIVE EQUILIBRIUM
   └── Balance analysis against intuitions
   └── May revise intuitions OR analysis
```

### Types of Counterexamples

| Type | Description | Response |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Too narrow** | Excludes cases that ARE F | Weaken conditions |
| **Too broad** | Includes cases that AREN'T F | Strengthen conditions |
| **Edge case** | Genuinely borderline | Accept vagueness or precisify |

## Classic Examples

### Knowledge (JTB Analysis)

```
ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE
═════════════════════

INITIAL ANALYSIS:
S knows that P iff:
1. S believes that P
2. P is true
3. S is justified in believing P

GETTIER COUNTEREXAMPLE:
Smith believes "The man who will get the job has 10 coins"
├── Justified (saw Jones counting coins)
├── True (Smith gets job, happens to have 10 coins)
├── But doesn't KNOW (true by luck)
└── Therefore: JTB is too broad

REVISIONS:
├── No false lemmas
├── Sensitivity: Would not believe if false
├── Safety: Could not easily be wrong
├── Virtue: True belief from intellectual virtue
└── Knowledge-first: Abandon analysis
```

### Free Will (Classical Analysis)

```
ANALYSIS OF FREE ACTION
═══════════════════════

SIMPLE ANALYSIS:
S acts freely iff S could have done otherwise

COUNTEREXAMPLE (Frankfurt):
├── Jones decides to vote for Biden
├── Unknown to Jones, a neuroscientist would intervene
│   if Jones was about to vote Trump
├── But Jones votes Biden on his own
├── Jones couldn't have done otherwise
├── Yet Jones seems to act freely
└── Therefore: PAP (Principle of Alternative Possibilities) fails

REVISIONS:
├── Focus on actual sequence
├── Reasons-responsiveness
├── Source theories (originates in agent)
```

### Art (Definition Attempt)

```
ANALYSIS OF ART
═══════════════

ATTEMPT 1: Representation
├── Art represents reality
├── Counterexample: Abstract art, pure music
└── Too narrow

ATTEMPT 2: Expression
├── Art expresses emotion
├── Counterexample: Some art is cold, intellectual
└── Too narrow

ATTEMPT 3: Significant Form (Bell)
├── Art has significant form
├── Problem: Circular—what makes form "significant"?
└── Uninformative

ATTEMPT 4: Institutional (Dickie)
├── Art = artifact + conferred artworld status
├── Problem: What's the artworld? Circular?
└── Contested

LESSON: Some concepts may resist analysis
```

## Techniques

### Case Method

Generate cases to test the analysis:
1. **Clear positive cases**: Obviously F
2. **Clear negative cases**: Obviously not F
3. **Borderline cases**: Test boundaries
4. **Thought experiments**: Imaginative cases

### Necessary vs. Sufficient Conditions

```
NECESSARY CONDITIONS
════════════════════
Required for F-ness but may not be enough

"Being unmarried is necessary for being a bachelor"
├── All bachelors are unmarried
├── But not all unmarried people are bachelors
└── Unmarried is necessary, not sufficient

SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS
═════════════════════
Enough for F-ness but may not be required

"Being a square is sufficient for being a rectangle"
├── All squares are rectangles
├── But not all rectangles are squares
└── Square is sufficient, not necessary

BICONDITIONAL
═════════════
Both necessary and sufficient

"X is a bachelor iff X is an unmarried adult male"
├── All and only bachelors satisfy this
└── Captures the concept
```

### Ockham's Razor for Analyses

- Prefer simpler analyses
- Don't multiply conditions unnecessarily
- But don't oversimplify

## Challenges to Conceptual Analysis

### Family Resemblance (Wittgenstein)

- Some concepts lack common essence
- "Game" — no single defining feature
- Network of overlapping similarities

### Open Texture

- Concepts have unforeseen applications
- Cannot anticipate all cases
- Definitions are provisional

### Experimental Philosophy

- Intuitions vary across cultures, demographics
- Are armchair intuitions reliable?
- Need empirical investigation

### Naturalized Epistemology (Quine)

- No sharp analytic/synthetic distinction
- Conceptual truths are just very central beliefs
- Philosophy continuous with science

---

## Best Practices

### Do

- Start with clear cases
- Explain why conditions are chosen
- Consider multiple counterexamples
- Be prepared to revise
- Acknowledge borderline cases

### Don't

- Assume first analysis is right
- Ignore stubborn counterexamples
- Add ad hoc conditions to save analysis
- Claim certainty about contested concepts
- Forget that intuitions can be wrong

## Output Format

```markdown
## Conceptual Analysis: [CONCEPT]

### Initial Analysis
X is [CONCEPT] iff:
1. Condition 1
2. Condition 2
3. Condition 3

### Testing
**Clear positive case**: [Example satisfying conditions and being F]
**Clear negative case**: [Example not satisfying conditions, not being F]

### Counterexamples Found
1. [Counterexample 1] — Analysis is too [narrow/broad]
2. [Counterexample 2] — Analysis is too [narrow/broad]

### Revised Analysis
X is [CONCEPT] iff:
1. Revised condition 1
2. Revised condition 2
3. New condition 3

### Assessment
[How confident are we in this analysis?]
[Remaining difficulties?]
