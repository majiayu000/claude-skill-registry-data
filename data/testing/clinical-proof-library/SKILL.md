# Clinical Proof Library Skill

## When to Use
- Supporting marketing claims with evidence during campaigns and approvals.
- Equipping sales/field teams with compliant proof points.
- Preparing board/exec updates that require clinical rigor.

## Framework
1. **Evidence Catalog** – study summary, indication, patient population, outcomes, risk notes.
2. **Usage Guidelines** – approved claims, prohibited statements, required disclaimers.
3. **Attribution & Citations** – formatting rules, version control, reviewer sign-off.
4. **Access Controls** – who can view/edit, security classifications, audit logs.
5. **Refresh Cadence** – review schedule, owner assignments, trigger events.

## Templates
- Study summary sheet with key metrics + talking points.
- Claims/statement matrix linking copy to evidence.
- Reviewer checklist for new/updated evidence entries.

## Tips
- Tag evidence by persona + journey stage to speed campaign assembly.
- Store full-source PDFs + data tables for legal reference.
- Pair with `design-clinical-campaign` and `run-compliance-review` flows.
