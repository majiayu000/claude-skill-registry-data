# ABM Supply Chain

Use this skill to set up agent-based models.

## Workflow

1) Define nodes, agents, and constraints.
2) Set disruption scenarios and KPIs.
3) Run simulation and capture outcomes.
4) Recommend mitigations.

## Output expectations

- Provide scenario results and bottleneck analysis.
