# Creative Iteration Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- Refreshing creative fatigued campaigns.
- Coordinating rapid creative experiments across paid + organic teams.
- Documenting learnings with reusable creative formulas.

## Framework
1. **Creative Brief Template** – hook, CTA, proof, editing guidelines, mandatory/legal notes.
2. **Testing Matrix** – map variables (concept, format, CTA, length, hook) across channels.
3. **Production Workflow** – intake → concept → script/copy → edit → QA → publish.
4. **Measurement & Tagging** – UTM/tag schema, performance scoreboard, insights log.
5. **Scaling Guidelines** – roll-out thresholds, localization, evergreen library updates.

## Templates
- Single-slide creative brief + checklist.
- Experiment tracker w/ hypotheses, variants, outcomes, next steps.
- Evergreen asset library structure with tagging conventions.
- **GTM Agents Hook/CTA Library** – per-channel prompt bank pulled from GTM Agents Social Media Manager playbooks @puerto/README.md#183-212.
- **Runbook for Paid + Organic Sync** – outlines Monday creative standup, Wednesday QA, Friday results readout.
- **Guardrail Sheet** – min engagement/CVR per channel before pausing or pivoting.

## Tips
- Pair qualitative notes (comments, watch time) with quantitative metrics.
- Rotate creators and formats to avoid burnout and discover new winners.
- Use with `build-social-calendar` and `campaign-optimization-manager` workflows.
- Define success + kill thresholds before launching (e.g., CTR ≥1.5% for X, hook retention ≥35% on Reels).
- Mirror GTM Agents escalation tree: Social Strategist → Marketing Director → Comms lead within 15 mins if sentiment spikes negative.
- Keep Serena + Playwright handy for rapid landing page tweaks + visual QA.

## GTM Agents Creative Iteration Overlay
1. **Cadence**
   - Monday: backlog grooming + prioritization (use hook library to seed briefs).
   - Tuesday/Wednesday: production + QA (Pair design + copy pods, run Playwright visual checks).
   - Thursday: launch + monitor guardrails in near real-time.
   - Friday: learning sync → update evergreen library + share top performers in Weekly Packet.
2. **Guardrail Actions**
   - If two variants miss guardrails consecutively, trigger Sequential Thinking mini-RCA.
   - Pause paid boosts if CPA worsens >20% vs baseline; notify Growth + RevOps.
3. **Insight Logging**
   - Capture quote-sized "formula" (hook + format + CTA) for each winning asset; store with metrics + reuse plan.

## Tool Hooks
- **Serena** – patch landing page snippets or marketing automation flows referenced in creative tests.
- **Context7** – pull latest platform best-practice docs (LinkedIn ads specs, TikTok ratios) without leaving Claude.
- **Sequential Thinking** – facilitate post-test retros and iteration hypotheses.
- **Playwright** – automate screenshot packs for creative QA and stakeholder review.
