## Cold Outreach Templates

### Initial Outreach (Problem-Focused)

Hi [Name],

I noticed [specific observation about them/their company] and
wanted to reach out.

Many [their role/industry] I work with struggle with [specific
problem you solve]. [One sentence about what you do].

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if I could help?

Best,
Perry
```

### Initial Outreach (Referral-Based)
```
Subject: [Mutual connection] suggested I reach out

Hi [Name],

[Mutual connection] mentioned you might be interested in
[topic/service]. They thought we should connect.

I help [target audience] with [specific outcome]. Recently
helped [similar client] achieve [result].

Would a quick call this week work to see if I can help?

Best,
Perry

P.S. [Mutual connection] said to say hi!
```

### Initial Outreach (Value-First)
```
Subject: [Resource/Tip] for [their challenge]

Hi [Name],

I put together a quick guide on [topic relevant to them] that
I thought might be helpful given [observation about their situation].

[Link or brief tip]

more about what's working for others in [their industry].

**Email 2 (3-4 days later)**
```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

Just floating this back to the top of your inbox.

[Restate core value proposition in one sentence].

Worth a conversation?

Perry
```

**Email 3 (5-7 days later)**
```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

One more try - I know inboxes get crazy.

If [solving their problem] isn't a priority right now, no
worries at all. But if it is, I'd love to help.

Either way, wishing you well.

Perry
```

**Email 4 (Break-up email, 7-10 days later)**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing the timing isn't right.

I'll close out my notes on this, but if things change, just
reply to this email and we can pick up the conversation.

All the best,
Perry
