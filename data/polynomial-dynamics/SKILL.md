# Polynomial Dynamics

Dynamic structures via polynomial functor arrangements from Topos Institute

## Polynomial Interface

```
p = Output^y^Input
```

## Activation

Load when this skill is needed.

## Usage

```bash
bb ~/.claude/skills/polynomial-dynamics/run.bb
```

## Behavior

1. **MINUS (-1)**: Validate inputs
2. **ERGODIC (0)**: Process/transform  
3. **PLUS (+1)**: Emit results

## GF(3) Conservation

This skill participates in triadic composition: Σ trits ≡ 0 (mod 3)


## SDF Interleaving

This skill connects to **Software Design for Flexibility** (Hanson & Sussman, 2021):

### Primary Chapter: 6. Layering

**Concepts**: layered data, metadata, provenance, units

### GF(3) Balanced Triad

```
polynomial-dynamics (○) + SDF.Ch6 (+) + [balancer] (−) = 0
```

**Skill Trit**: 0 (ERGODIC - coordination)


### Connection Pattern

Layering adds metadata. This skill tracks provenance or annotations.
