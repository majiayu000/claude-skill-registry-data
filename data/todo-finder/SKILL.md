# TODO Finder Skill

Searches codebase for TODO, FIXME, HACK, NOTE, and similar comments, organizing them by priority and file.

## When to Use

This skill activates when the user wants to find action items in code:
- "Find all TODOs in the project"
- "Show me what FIXMEs we have"
- "List all the HACKs in the codebase"
- "What needs to be done in this project?"
- "Find all code comments with action items"

## Instructions

### Step 1: Search for Action Item Comments

Use Grep to find common action item markers:
- **TODO**: Things that need to be done
- **FIXME**: Things that need to be fixed
- **HACK**: Temporary solutions that need improvement
- **BUG**: Known bugs
- **NOTE**: Important notes
- **XXX**: Warnings or important items
- **OPTIMIZE**: Performance improvements needed
- **REFACTOR**: Code that needs refactoring

### Step 2: Organize by Priority

Group findings by severity:
1. **Critical** (FIXME, BUG)
2. **Important** (TODO, HACK)
3. **Informational** (NOTE, OPTIMIZE, REFACTOR)

### Step 3: Format the Output

Display results in a clear, actionable format:

```
📋 Code Action Items Summary
================================

🔴 Critical (2 items):

📁 src/auth/login.js:45
   FIXME: Authentication bypass vulnerability if user is null

📁 src/api/payments.js:127
   BUG: Payment processing fails for amounts over $10,000

⚠️  Important (5 items):

📁 src/components/Header.js:23
   TODO: Add mobile responsive menu

📁 src/utils/validation.js:89
   HACK: Using regex for email validation, should use proper library

📁 src/services/api.js:156
   TODO: Implement retry logic for failed requests

📁 src/db/connection.js:34
   HACK: Hardcoded connection pool size, should be configurable

📁 src/pages/Dashboard.js:78
   TODO: Add loading skeleton for better UX

ℹ️  Informational (3 items):

📁 src/utils/formatting.js:67
   NOTE: Date format follows ISO 8601 standard

📁 src/algorithms/search.js:234
   OPTIMIZE: Can use binary search here for O(log n) instead of O(n)

📁 src/components/Table.js:145
   REFACTOR: This component is too large, split into smaller components

================================
Total: 10 action items
```

### Step 4: Provide Context

For each item, show:
- File path and line number
- The comment type (TODO, FIXME, etc.)
- The full comment text
- Surrounding context if helpful

### Step 5: Suggest Next Steps

Recommend actions based on findings:
- If many FIXME/BUGs: "Consider addressing critical issues first"
- If many HACKs: "These temporary solutions should be properly implemented"
- If many TODOs: "Prioritize and add to your backlog"

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Search

**User:** "Find all TODOs in this project"

**Response:**
```
Searching for TODO comments...

Found 7 TODO items:

📁 src/components/Dashboard.js:45
   TODO: Add error boundary for better error handling

📁 src/hooks/useAuth.js:23
   TODO: Implement token refresh logic

   TODO: Add tests for edge cases

📁 docs/API.md:12
   TODO: Document new endpoints

Total: 7 TODO items found
```

### Example 2: Multiple Types

**User:** "Show me all action items - TODOs, FIXMEs, everything"

**Response:**
```
Scanning codebase for action items...

🔴 CRITICAL (1):

📁 src/api/users.js:234
   FIXME: SQL injection vulnerability in search query

⚠️  IMPORTANT (4):

📁 src/auth/session.js:67
   TODO: Implement session timeout

📁 src/components/ImageUpload.js:45
   HACK: Using setTimeout instead of proper image processing library

📁 src/utils/validator.js:123
   TODO: Add input sanitization

📁 src/config/db.js:28
   BUG: Connection pool exhaustion under high load

ℹ️  INFORMATIONAL (2):

📁 src/algorithms/sort.js:89
   OPTIMIZE: Use quicksort instead of bubble sort

📁 src/components/LargeForm.js:234
   REFACTOR: Split into smaller components

Total: 7 items (1 critical, 4 important, 2 informational)
```

### Example 3: Specific File

**User:** "Find TODOs in the authentication module"

**Response:**
```
Searching for TODOs in authentication files...

📁 src/auth/login.js:
   Line 45: TODO: Add 2FA support
   Line 89: TODO: Implement remember me functionality
   Line 156: NOTE: Password hashing uses bcrypt with salt rounds of 12

📁 src/auth/session.js:
   Line 23: TODO: Add session cleanup cron job
   Line 67: FIXME: Session storage not working in Safari
   Line 123: TODO: Implement single sign-on

📁 src/auth/permissions.js:
   Line 34: TODO: Add role-based access control
   Line 78: HACK: Permissions hardcoded, should come from database

Total: 8 items in authentication module
```

## Search Patterns

### Standard Markers
```
TODO:     - Tasks to be completed
FIXME:    - Things that are broken and need fixing
BUG:      - Known bugs
HACK:     - Temporary workarounds
XXX:      - Important warnings
NOTE:     - Important information
OPTIMIZE: - Performance improvements needed
REFACTOR: - Code quality improvements needed
```

### Extended Markers
```
REVIEW:   - Needs code review
TEST:     - Needs testing
DOC:      - Documentation needed
CLEANUP:  - Code cleanup needed
SECURITY: - Security concerns
```

## Grep Command Examples

### Find all TODO comments:
```bash
grep -rn "TODO:" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" .
```

### Find multiple types:
```bash
grep -rn -E "(TODO|FIXME|HACK|BUG):" --include="*.js" .
```

### Case-insensitive search:
```bash
grep -rni "todo:" .
```

## Output Formatting Tips

### Group by Priority
1. Show critical items first (FIXME, BUG)
2. Then important items (TODO, HACK)
3. Finally informational items

### Show Context
- Include file path and line number
- Show the full comment
- Add surrounding code if it helps understanding

### Make It Actionable
- Count items by type
- Suggest which to tackle first
- Note patterns (e.g., many TODOs in one file)

## Tips

### For Complete Search
- Search all relevant file types (.js, .ts, .py, .java, etc.)
- Include test files
- Check documentation files
- Don't forget config files

### For Better Organization
- Group by file or by type
- Sort by priority
- Show totals and summaries
- Highlight critical items

### For Context
- Show line numbers for easy navigation
- Include surrounding code if helpful
- Note who added it if in git blame
- Show when it was added (if checking git history)

## Common Variations

### Search Specific Directory
"Find TODOs in the components folder"

### Search by Type
"Show me all FIXME comments"

### Search by Priority
"What are the critical issues in the code?"

### Search with Context
"Find TODOs and show me the code around them"

## Edge Cases

### No Results
```
✨ Great news! No TODO items found in the codebase.

Either the project is complete or TODOs are tracked elsewhere (like GitHub Issues).
```

### Too Many Results
```
⚠️  Found 127 TODO items - that's a lot!

Showing top 10 by priority. Use 'find TODOs in [specific folder]' to narrow down.
```

### Commented Out TODOs
```
Note: Found some commented-out TODOs (e.g., // // TODO)
These might be old items that were resolved. Consider removing them.
```

## Remember

- **Search broadly**: Include all file types
- **Organize clearly**: Group by priority/type
- **Make actionable**: Show file:line for easy navigation
- **Add value**: Don't just list, organize and prioritize
- **Suggest next steps**: Help user decide what to tackle first
