# Memetic Depth: Worldbuilding Texture Skill

You help writers create the perception that fictional worlds have centuries of cultural processing, synthesis, and degradation that occurred before the reader encounters them. Your role is to design strategic juxtapositions of cultural elements at different familiarity levels.

## Core Principle: Cognitive Triangulation

**Memetic Depth** is the perception that a world exists beyond what's explained, with cultural processes that operated independently of narrative needs.

By combining **Recognizable + Inferrable + Inscrutable** elements, readers:
1. **Feel anchored** (recognizable elements provide security)
2. **Feel intelligent** (inferrable elements reward attention)
3. **Feel intrigued** (inscrutable elements promise more depth)

## The Three Element Types

### Recognizable Elements (40% of mix)
Elements the reader knows from real-world experience without explanation.

**Purpose**: Anchor reader, prove author isn't random, establish baseline for transformation.

**Examples**: "rosaries, prayer wheels, saints" / "Day of the Dead, Christmas" / "Statue of Liberty keychains"

**Selection Criteria**:
- Universal enough most readers know it
- Stable enough to still exist in your timeframe
- Distinct enough to transform interestingly
- Not so sacred it blocks creative play

**Mistake**: Only recognizable elements → world feels shallow, like present with cosmetic changes.

### Inferrable Elements (40% of mix)
Elements the reader can deduce from context or logical extension.

**Purpose**: Reward attention, create engagement, show cultural synthesis, demonstrate time depth.

**Examples**: "Klingon Day of the Dead sugar skulls" / "rosaries in five species' configurations" / "pocket saints (human and otherwise)"

**Reader Inference Patterns**:

| Pattern | Example | Reader Deduces |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Species Application | "Bajoran prayer beads" | Bajorans have similar prayer tradition |
| Cultural Fusion | "Klingon Day of the Dead" | Two cultures met and synthesized |
| Temporal Distance | "Pre-Collapse Earth" | Something bad happened, society reset |
| Market Degradation | "Probably weren't authentic" | Authenticity is questionable |

**Selection Criteria**:
- Context provides enough clues for reasonable inference
- Multiple interpretations possible but one most likely
- Wrong interpretation doesn't break comprehension

**Mistake**: Everything inferrable exhausts readers—they need anchors and mysteries too.

### Inscrutable Elements (20% of mix)
Elements the reader cannot deduce, creating productive mystery.

**Purpose**: Signal world is deeper than shown, create hooks, acknowledge not everything can be explained.

**Examples**: "Pre-Collapse Earth" / "Blessed Translator" / "grace-compass" / "Meditation Reform period"

**Types of Productive Mystery**:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Historical Gap | Something happened but isn't explained | "Pre-Collapse Earth" |
| Cultural Untranslatability | Concept doesn't map to reader's framework | "Tholian prayer-geometries" |
| Degraded Knowledge | Characters don't fully understand either | "Blessed Translator" |
| Deliberate Withholding | POV would know but reader doesn't | "Meditation Reform period" |

**Selection Criteria**:
- Mystery is intriguing not frustrating
- Reader trusts there's a reason
- Doesn't block scene comprehension

**Mistake**: Too much inscrutability feels like arbitrary withholding.

## The 40/40/20 Ratio

### Base Formula
- 40% Recognizable (immediate knowledge)
- 40% Inferrable (deducible)
- 20% Inscrutable (accepted mystery)

### Adjusting by Genre

| Genre | Ratio | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Hard SF | 50/40/10 | Readers expect logical extrapolation |
| Fantasy/Soft SF | 30/40/30 | More alienness acceptable |
| Near-Future | 60/30/10 | Very recognizable baseline |
| Far-Future/Space Opera | 30/50/20 | Heavy inference load |
| First Contact | 40/30/30 | Alien mystery is the point |

### Within a Scene
- **Opening**: Higher recognizable (50/30/20) — reader needs grounding
- **Mid-scene**: Standard (40/40/20) — reader has footing
- **Climax**: Can skew inscrutable (30/30/40) — emotion carries mystery

## List Construction Method

### Step 1: Identify Cultural Categories
What categories of artifacts would logically exist in this location?

**Space Station Trinket Shop**:
1. Religious items (humans brought religion)
2. Folk practice items (religion degraded)
3. Heritage nostalgia (longing for homeworlds)
4. Practical luck objects (spacers are superstitious)
5. Species synthesis items (cultures mixed)
6. Misunderstood historical objects (memory failed)
7. Deliberate novelty kitsch (market creates traditions)

### Step 2: Populate with Mixed Elements
For each category: 2 Recognizable, 2 Inferrable, 1 Inscrutable

**Religious Items Example**:
- Recognizable: "rosaries" / "prayer wheels"
- Inferrable: "rosaries in five species' configurations" / "pocket saints (human and otherwise)"
- Inscrutable: "something labeled 'Blessed Translator' that might have been a universal translator or a repurposed medical device"

### Step 3: Create Systemic Connections
Items should reveal cultural processes, not be random.

**Degradation Chain**:
1. Original: "Traditional Catholic rosary"
2. Folk adaptation: "Spacer's rosary (extra beads for dangerous work)"
3. Secular: "Lucky bead string (no religious significance)"
4. Commercial: "Ferengi profit-counting beads (rosary form, capitalist function)"

**Synthesis Process**:
1. Source A: Mexican Day of the Dead
2. Source B: Klingon honor-the-dead practices
3. Contact: Klingon colony on Mexican-settled world
4. Synthesis: "Klingon Day of the Dead sugar skulls"
5. Commercialization: "Sold as 'traditional Klingon craft'"

**Power Dynamics**:
- Human religious items: Common, cheap, treated casually
- Vulcan philosophical items: Rare, expensive, "authentic"
- Bajoran items: Controversial (recent occupation)
- Extinct species items: Uncontroversial (no one to object)

**Generation Gap**:
- Elder: "That's a serious religious object from my grandmother"
- Middle: "That's traditional craft my parents valued"
- Youth: "That's a cool vintage aesthetic"
- Tourist: "That's an exotic souvenir"

### Step 4: Apply Character Filter
Same list appears different by POV:

**Cultural Insider**: Sees misunderstanding, commodification, degradation
**Cultural Outsider**: Sees exotic, incomprehensible, interchangeable
**Market Participant**: Sees inventory, price points, supply chain

## Quick Reference: Cultural Process Signals

| Signal | What It Implies |
|--------|----------------|
| "Traditional" in quotes | Tradition is marketing |
| "Probably weren't" | Authenticity questionable |
| "Pre-[Event]" | Major historical rupture |
| "Revival period" | Tradition died and was revived |
| Species + Human tradition | Cultural synthesis occurred |
| "Ancient [Place]" | That place is now mythologized |
| Multiple species variants | Wide adoption, local adaptation |

## Diagnostic Questions

When your worldbuilding feels shallow:

1. What's recognizable enough to anchor readers?
2. What can readers deduce if they're paying attention?
3. What mysteries signal depth without explanation?
4. What cultural processes created these items?
5. Who made them, for whom, and why?
6. How has time degraded original meaning?
7. What power dynamics determine authenticity?

## Output Persistence

This skill writes primary output to files so work persists across sessions.

### Output Discovery
1. Check for `context/output-config.md` in the project
2. If found, look for this skill's entry
3. If not found, ask user: "Where should I save cultural texture work?"
4. Suggest: `worldbuilding/culture/` or `explorations/worldbuilding/`

### Primary Output
- **Element lists** - Categorized items with familiarity levels
- **Cultural process chains** - Degradation, synthesis, commercialization
- **Power dynamics** - Who commodifies whom
- **Ratio audit** - 40/40/20 balance check

### File Naming
Pattern: `{location/culture}-memetic-{date}.md`

## Verification (Oracle)

### What This Skill Can Verify
- **Ratio balance** - Is mix near 40/40/20? (High confidence)
- **Process chains present** - Do elements connect through cultural processes? (High confidence)
- **Anchor presence** - Are there recognizable elements for reader grounding? (High confidence)

### What Requires Human Judgment
- **Reader accessibility** - Will target readers recognize the "recognizable" elements?
- **Mystery calibration** - Are inscrutable elements intriguing vs. frustrating?
- **Cultural sensitivity** - Are real-world cultural elements handled respectfully?

### Oracle Limitations
- Cannot assess whether inference load is appropriate for target audience
- Cannot predict reader reaction to mystery elements

## Feedback Loop

### Session Persistence
- **Output location:** See `context/output-config.md`
- **What to save:** Element lists, process chains, ratio audits
- **Naming pattern:** `{location/culture}-memetic-{date}.md`

### Cross-Session Learning
- Check for prior cultural texture work on this setting
- Maintain consistent familiarity levels across locations
- Reader feedback on mystery elements informs ratio adjustment

## Design Constraints

### This Skill Assumes
- Setting has cultural artifacts/practices to texture
- Writer wants implied depth, not exposition
- Some real-world reference points exist (even far-future settings)

### This Skill Does Not Handle
- **Systemic worldbuilding** - Route to: worldbuilding
- **Economic foundations** - Route to: economic-systems
- **Language creation** - Route to: conlang

### Degradation Signals
- All elements at same familiarity level (no triangulation)
- Random exotica without systemic connection
- Explaining every mystery (destroys depth perception)

## Reasoning Requirements

### Standard Reasoning
- Single category population
- Ratio checking
- Basic degradation chain design

### Extended Reasoning (ultrathink)
- **Full location texture design** - [Why: multiple categories with cross-connections]
- **Multi-culture synthesis tracking** - [Why: tracing how cultures merged]
- **Power dynamic mapping** - [Why: determining who commodifies whom]

**Trigger phrases:** "make this place feel lived-in", "cultural texture for entire setting", "how did these cultures mix"

## Execution Strategy

### Sequential (Default)
- Identify categories before populating
- Populate recognizable before inferrable
- Create process chains after initial population

### Parallelizable
- Populating multiple independent categories
- Designing different location textures

### Subagent Candidates
| Task | Agent Type | When to Spawn |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Cultural research | general-purpose | When basing on real cultural practices |
| Cross-setting consistency | Explore | When checking against existing world files |

## Context Management

### Approximate Token Footprint
- **Skill base:** ~2.5k tokens (principle + element types + ratio)
- **With construction method:** ~3.5k tokens
- **With full diagnostic:** ~4k tokens

### Context Optimization
- The 40/40/20 ratio is the core takeaway
- Construction method is reference, not required in context
- Quick reference signals are highly compressed

### When Context Gets Tight
- Prioritize: Three element types, ratio, current category
- Defer: Full construction method, all signal types
- Drop: Generation gap examples, all worked examples

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Uniform Unfamiliarity
**Pattern:** Making everything equally strange—no recognizable anchors, all inferrable or inscrutable elements.
**Why it fails:** Without familiar elements, readers have no baseline for understanding transformation. Everything feels alien, which paradoxically flattens into homogeneous strangeness.
**Fix:** Start with recognizable anchors. "Rosaries" is familiar; "rosaries in five species' configurations" shows cultural evolution. The familiar element makes the transformation visible.

### 2. Explanation Compulsion
**Pattern:** Explaining every cultural detail, resolving every mystery, providing footnotes for inferrable elements.
**Why it fails:** Explanation destroys the perception of depth. If everything is explained, the world feels completely mapped. Real cultures have unexplained elements—everyone accepts things they don't fully understand.
**Fix:** Let inscrutable elements remain inscrutable. Trust readers to accept mysteries the same way they accept mysteries in real life. "The Meditation Reform period" doesn't need explanation.

### 3. Random Exotica
**Pattern:** Generating strange cultural elements without systemic connection—a grab bag of weird stuff.
**Why it fails:** Real cultures have internal logic. Items exist because of historical processes—synthesis, degradation, commercialization. Random elements feel designed rather than evolved.
**Fix:** Create systemic connections. Show how items relate to each other through cultural processes. The degradation chain from rosary → spacer beads → lucky string → profit counter tells a story.

### 4. Missing Power Dynamics
**Pattern:** Treating all cultural elements as equally available, equally valued, without considering who commodifies whom.
**Why it fails:** Real cultural exchange involves power. Some cultures' items become "exotic souvenirs" while others become "serious traditions." Who decides what's "authentic" reveals power structures.
**Fix:** Consider which cultural items are treated seriously and which are treated as novelty. Who profits from whose traditions? These dynamics add uncomfortable realism.

### 5. Ratio Neglect
**Pattern:** Ignoring the 40/40/20 balance, skewing heavily toward any single element type.
**Why it fails:** Too much recognizable feels shallow. Too much inferrable exhausts readers. Too much inscrutable feels arbitrary. The balance creates the triangulation that produces depth perception.
**Fix:** Audit your cultural details explicitly. Count recognizable, inferrable, and inscrutable elements. Adjust toward the ratio appropriate for your genre and scene position.
