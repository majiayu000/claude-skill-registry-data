## Who is the Id?

Id types are energetic, adventurous communicators who combine high sociability with persuasive assertiveness. They thrive in dynamic, people-focused environments where they can leverage their charisma and creative thinking to inspire action. They're big-picture thinkers who communicate with bold, colorful language and make intuitive, fast decisions. What drives them is influence, freedom, and the excitement of new opportunities.

## Do's

- Use casual yet assertive communication with enthusiastic, colorful language.
- Describe ideas vividly and engage their imagination.
- Focus on the big picture and possibilities rather than getting lost in details.
- Give them freedom to explore opportunities and brainstorm creatively.
- Approach problems positively and remain open to new ideas.
- Let them lead discussions and pitch their vision.
- Match their pace -- they move fast and expect others to keep up.
- Provide encouragement and recognize their contributions publicly.

## Don'ts

- Don't force them into rigid procedures, predictable routines, or excessive structure.
- Don't lead with detailed data, root-cause analysis, or exhaustive research.
- Don't rely heavily on written communication when verbal would work better.
- Don't slow them down with step-by-step instructions or excessive process.
- Don't nitpick details when they're in visioning mode.
- Don't be passive or indecisive -- they respect directness and confidence.
- Don't expect them to sit through extended analytical exercises without social breaks.
- Don't overwhelm them with comprehensive decision-making frameworks before they've had time to brainstorm.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Prefer in-person meetings without rigid agendas. Id types thrive in dynamic discussions where ideas can flow freely. Keep the energy up and allow for creative exploration while staying generally on track. They'll disengage if meetings feel overly structured or bureaucratic.

### Email
Keep messages brief, casual, and focused on high-level information. Id types will skim long, detailed emails. Lead with the exciting parts and save details for follow-up conversations if needed. A punchy subject line and a clear ask go further than a thorough briefing.

### Giving Feedback
Deliver encouragement-focused feedback that addresses broader concepts rather than nitpicky details. Id types respond better to positive framing and will engage more deeply when feedback feels supportive and future-oriented. Lead with what's working, then redirect.

### Resolving Conflict
Approach problems productively through discussion and collaborative creative problem-solving. Id types want to work through issues together and find win-win solutions rather than dwelling on blame. Keep it solution-focused and forward-looking.
