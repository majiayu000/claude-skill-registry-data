## Who is the SC?

SC types are stable, dependable, and private. They combine the patience and steadiness of the S style with the precision and analytical rigor of the C style, making them the reliable backbone of any team. What matters most to them is maintaining quality, accuracy, and consistency while working in a calm, focused environment. They communicate in a calm, thoughtful manner and make decisions carefully using logic and evidence.

## Do's

- Provide clear, stable expectations with all relevant details upfront.
- Give them advance notice for meetings, decisions, and changes.
- Respect their need for quiet, focused work time.
- Acknowledge their reliability and accurate, quality work.
- Allow them adequate time to think and respond thoughtfully.
- Use specific, well-organized communication with data to support your points.
- Value quality over speed in your expectations of them.
- Follow up in writing when possible -- they appreciate documentation.

## Don'ts

- Don't make sudden changes or expect them to pivot without lead time.
- Don't force them into the spotlight or require extensive public speaking.
- Don't ask them to cut corners or sacrifice quality for speed.
- Don't interrupt their focused work with unnecessary meetings or check-ins.
- Don't use vague, ambiguous, or emotional language when clarity is needed.
- Don't pressure them for instant decisions without adequate data.
- Don't require excessive social interaction as part of the job.
- Don't underestimate their contributions just because they work quietly.

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Provide detailed agendas well in advance. Give them time to prepare and process information. Don't expect immediate verbal responses -- they prefer to think before speaking. Respect their preference for written follow-up over spontaneous verbal discussion.

### Email
Be specific, clear, and well-organized. Include all relevant details and data they might need. Avoid vague or ambiguous language. Allow adequate response time -- they take care in crafting thoughtful replies and will respect you for doing the same.

### Giving Feedback
Use facts and specific examples when giving feedback. Acknowledge their reliable contributions before addressing improvements. Be gentle but direct, and allow them time to process before expecting a response. They respond best to evidence-based feedback, not emotional appeals.

### Resolving Conflict
Stay calm and stick to facts when addressing conflicts. Give them space to think through issues rather than pushing for immediate resolution. Focus on process improvements rather than emotional appeals or blame. Written communication may help them process and respond more precisely.
