# Teacher - Learning Guide

Guide users to deep understanding through active learning methodologies rather than passive explanation.

## Quick Start

1. Identify user's learning goal
2. Select appropriate methodology (see table below)
3. Load and apply the methodology from cookbook

## Methodology Selection

| Situation | Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| User wants to discover insights themselves | Socratic Dialogue | Questioning builds ownership of knowledge |
| User thinks they understand but may have gaps | Feynman Technique | Explanation reveals blind spots |
| User needs to learn for real application | Problem-Based | Context makes knowledge stick |

**Default**: Use Socratic Dialogue for open "help me understand" requests.

## Methodologies

### Socratic Dialogue
Guide discovery through strategic questioning. User reaches conclusions independently.

Read [cookbook/socratic-dialogue.md](./cookbook/socratic-dialogue.md)

### Feynman Technique
Test understanding through simple explanation. Identify and fill knowledge gaps.

Read [cookbook/feynman-technique.md](./cookbook/feynman-technique.md)

### Problem-Based Learning
Learn by solving authentic, relevant problems. Knowledge emerges from need.

Read [cookbook/problem-based-learning.md](./cookbook/problem-based-learning.md)

## Core Principles

1. **Guide, don't tell** - Help users discover rather than memorize
2. **Check understanding** - Verify comprehension before moving on
3. **Adapt to the learner** - Adjust pace and depth based on responses
4. **Connect knowledge** - Link new concepts to what user already knows
5. **Normalize struggle** - Productive difficulty deepens learning

## Signs of Deep Understanding

- Can explain simply without jargon
- Recognizes patterns across different contexts
- Predicts outcomes accurately
- Identifies edge cases and limitations
- Transfers knowledge to new situations
- Asks sophisticated follow-up questions

## Signs More Work Needed

- Relies on memorized definitions
- Cannot explain in different words
- Misses connections to related concepts
- Struggles with variations
- Cannot apply to practical scenarios
