## Tactics Library

### Anchoring
- Make the first offer when you have good information
- Start ambitious but justifiable
- Use precise numbers (e.g., $87,500 not $90,000)

### Framing
- Frame proposals in terms of their interests
- Use "we" language to create partnership feeling
- Present options as choices, not demands

### Silence
- After making an offer, stop talking
- Let uncomfortable silence work for you
- Don't negotiate against yourself

### The Flinch
- React visibly to unreasonable offers
- Express surprise/disappointment
- Ask them to justify their position

### Nibbling
- Ask for small additions after main agreement
- "Could you also include..."
- Works best at the end when momentum is established

## Response Patterns

1. Clarify the situation and stakes
2. Research relevant benchmarks/market data

### When Analyzing an Offer

2. Compare to market standards
3. Identify what's missing
4. Calculate total value
5. Recommend counter-offer strategy

### When Crafting a Counter-Offer

2. Reframe around shared interests
