# Content Research Writer

This skill helps create compelling, well-researched content in the user's authentic voice. It avoids "AI slop" by analyzing writing samples, conducting research, and providing proper citations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests:
- Blog posts or articles
- Marketing content
- Newsletters or email campaigns
- Social media posts (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)
- Technical documentation with research
- Product announcements
- Case studies or whitepapers

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Request

Clarify:
- **Topic**: What is the content about?
- **Purpose**: Why is this being written? (educate, market, inform, persuade)
- **Audience**: Who will read this?
- **Tone**: Professional, casual, technical, conversational?
- **Length**: Word count or section structure?

### 2. Analyze Voice (If Available)

If the user provides reference writing samples:
- Read existing content carefully
- Identify:
  - Sentence structure patterns (short punchy vs long flowing)
  - Vocabulary level and word choices
  - Use of contractions, idioms, metaphors
  - Paragraph rhythm and pacing
  - How technical concepts are explained
  - Emotional tone and energy level
  - First person vs third person usage

### 3. Research Phase

Conduct thorough research:
- Use web search to find recent, relevant sources
- Look for:
  - Statistics and data points
  - Expert quotes and perspectives
  - Recent news or developments
  - Case studies or examples
  - Contrarian viewpoints
- Prioritize authoritative sources:
  - Academic papers
  - Industry reports
  - Official documentation
  - Reputable news outlets
  - Domain experts

### 4. Content Structure

Organize the content logically:

**For Blog Posts**:
1. Hook (compelling opening)
2. Problem/context
3. Main points (3-5 key ideas)
4. Supporting evidence with citations
5. Conclusion/call-to-action

**For Newsletters**:
1. Personal opening
2. Main story or insight
3. Supporting examples
4. Practical takeaway
5. Conversational close

**For Technical Content**:
1. Clear problem statement
2. Context and background
3. Solution approach
4. Implementation details
5. Results and implications

### 5. Writing Guidelines

**Voice Authenticity**:
- Match the user's established patterns
- Use their vocabulary and phrasing
- Mirror their sentence structure
- Maintain their level of formality
- Replicate their storytelling style

**Research Integration**:
- Cite sources naturally in the flow
- Use block quotes sparingly (only for impactful statements)
- Paraphrase research findings in the user's voice
- Include [citation] markers or footnotes
- Link to sources when relevant

**Avoid AI Slop**:
- ❌ Generic platitudes ("In today's digital landscape...")
- ❌ Overused transitions ("Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally")
- ❌ Buzzword soup without substance
- ❌ Robotic, formal language when user is casual
- ❌ Formulaic introductions and conclusions

**Do**:
- ✅ Start with a specific, concrete hook
- ✅ Use concrete examples and stories
- ✅ Include surprising insights or data
- ✅ Make strong, opinionated claims (when appropriate)
- ✅ End with memorable takeaways

### 6. Citation Format

**Inline Citations**:
```
According to a 2024 Stanford study, AI-assisted coding increased productivity by 126% [1].
```

**Footnote Style**:
```
The foreclosure market in Brevard County grew 23% year-over-year.¹
