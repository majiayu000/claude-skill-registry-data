# Media Adaptation

## Purpose

Systematically analyze existing media (TV, film, games, etc.) to extract transferable elements that can be authentically transformed for new settings, particularly science fiction. Captures what makes originals compelling while creating genuinely new works rather than superficial reskins.

## Core Principle

**Transform, don't transplant.** The goal is to understand WHY something works and recreate that function in a new context, not to simply change surface details.

---

## Phase 1: Core Appeal Identification

### Emotional Experience Analysis

**Questions:**
- What emotional journey does the audience take?
- What specific moments create the strongest response?
- What underlying fears or desires does this tap into?
- How does tension build and release throughout?

**Document:**
- Primary emotional arc
- Peak emotional moments
- Underlying psychological appeal
- Tension/release pattern

### Power Dynamic Analysis

**Questions:**
- Who has power and why?
- What creates vulnerability in the system?
- How do underdogs gain agency?
- What institutional pressures shape behavior?

**Document:**
- Power sources
- System vulnerabilities
- Agency mechanisms
- Institutional pressures

### Conflict Architecture

**Questions:**
- What creates the central tension?
- How do individual goals conflict with systemic demands?
- What makes resolution difficult but not impossible?
- Where do moral complexities emerge?

**Document:**
- Central tension structure
- Individual vs. system conflicts
- Resolution barriers
- Moral complexity sources

## Phase 2: Element Classification

### Universal Elements (Direct Transfer)

Elements that work across any setting because they tap into fundamental human nature:

**Emotional Universals:**
- Fear of the unknown
- Desire for justice/fairness
- Need for belonging/community
- Drive for competence/mastery
- Search for meaning/purpose

**Relationship Dynamics:**
- Mentor/apprentice bonds
- Unlikely partnerships
- Family loyalty vs. duty conflicts
- Trust building through shared adversity
- Betrayal and redemption arcs

**Structural Tensions:**
- Individual agency vs. institutional control
- Short-term survival vs. long-term consequences
- Competing loyalties and obligations
- Resource scarcity creating difficult choices
- Information asymmetry driving conflict

### Setting-Dependent Elements (Translation Required)

Elements tied to specific contexts that need equivalents in new settings:

| Original Element | Translation Question | Examples |
|------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Authority Structures | What creates legitimate authority? | Corporate security, planetary governance, AI arbitration |
| Resource Systems | What resources create power? | Energy allocation, genetic access, data privileges |
| Communication Networks | How does information flow? | Quantum networks, AI surveillance, bioelectric signals |
| Enforcement Mechanisms | How are rules enforced? | Exile, memory modification, economic isolation |

### Culture-Specific Elements (Replacement Required)

Elements too tied to specific cultures/times to transfer meaningfully:
- Specific cultural practices or beliefs
- Historical references and contexts
- Technology tied to particular development paths
- Social structures unique to specific societies

**Replacement Strategy:**
1. Maintain the underlying function
2. Create new forms that serve the same story purpose
3. Ensure replacements emerge logically from new setting
4. Test that replacements generate similar emotional responses

---

## Phase 3: Systemic Translation

### Environmental Pressure Analysis

1. Identify survival/social pressures in original
2. Map equivalent pressures in new environment
3. Trace how new pressures modify social structures
4. Identify new conflict opportunities

### Power Structure Evolution

1. List all sources of power/influence in original
2. For each, identify underlying principle (competence, resources, legitimacy)
3. Create equivalents operating on same principles
4. Consider entirely new power sources from new setting

### Conflict Evolution Mapping

1. Map conflict resolution barriers in original
2. Identify which barriers persist in new setting
3. Determine how new elements create new barriers
4. Discover how new elements provide new solution paths

---

## Phase 4: Authenticity Validation

### Systemic Consistency Check

- Do all elements emerge logically from setting premises?
- Are power structures sustainable given environmental constraints?
- Do conflict patterns make sense given social organization?
- Would translated elements create desired emotional experience?

### Cultural Sensitivity Review

- Have you inadvertently imported problematic cultural assumptions?
- Do translations respect the complexity of issues involved?
- Are you presenting harmful systems as normative or critiquing them?
- Do new elements create new forms of potential harm or injustice?

### Originality Assessment

- Is this sufficiently transformed to be genuinely new?
- Do new elements add meaningful complexity beyond cosmetic changes?
- Would someone familiar with original see this as derivative or inspired-by?
- Does this work stand alone without knowledge of original?

## Quick Reference: Translation Priorities

**Essential (Must Transfer):**
- Fundamental emotional experience
- Core power dynamics
- Central tension structure
- Key relationship patterns

**Adaptive (Modify to Fit):**
- Authority sources and structures
- Resource systems and constraints
- Communication methods and barriers
- Enforcement mechanisms and consequences

**Replacement (Create New):**
- Specific cultural practices
- Historical contexts and references
- Setting-specific technologies
- Unique social institutions

## Example: Police Procedural → Sci-Fi

### Original Analysis
- **Core Appeal:** Order from chaos through competent investigation
- **Power Dynamics:** Legal authority vs. criminal freedom, bureaucracy vs. justice
- **Conflict Architecture:** Limited resources, jurisdictional constraints, time pressure

### Translation
- **New Setting:** Interplanetary corporate territories with competing legal systems
- **New Pressures:** Communication delays, jurisdictional complexity, resource scarcity
- **New Conflicts:** Corporate law vs. universal law, evidence across light-years, witness diaspora

### Validation
- **Systemic Logic:** Corporate territories make sense for resource extraction economics
- **Emotional Core:** Still provides order-from-chaos satisfaction
- **Originality:** Environmental constraints create genuinely new story possibilities

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. The Cosmetic Reskin
**Pattern:** Changing surface details (costumes, technology, names) without transforming underlying dynamics. "It's the same story but in space."
**Why it fails:** Audiences recognize the original immediately. The adaptation feels derivative rather than inspired. No new insights emerge from the new context.
**Fix:** Identify what FUNCTION each element serves, then find what naturally creates that function in the new setting. The new version should work even if audiences never heard of the original.

### 2. The Fidelity Trap
**Pattern:** Treating faithfulness to source as the primary virtue. "We have to include this because it was in the original."
**Why it fails:** Not everything translates. Forcing elements that don't fit the new context breaks immersion. Fidelity to form can betray fidelity to function.
**Fix:** Prioritize what makes the original WORK over what HAPPENS in it. Some elements may need to be replaced entirely to serve the same function.

### 3. The Genre Collision
**Pattern:** Adapting without considering how genre expectations change. A tragedy translated into an action setting becomes unintentionally comedic.
**Why it fails:** Genre carries audience expectations. The same plot beats land differently in different genre contexts. Tonal whiplash destroys engagement.
**Fix:** Map the emotional journey explicitly. Verify that adapted elements deliver the same emotional beats in the new genre context.

### 4. The Surface Diversity
**Pattern:** Translating cultural elements by swapping demographics without understanding cultural function. "We'll just make them aliens instead."
**Why it fails:** Cultural elements often serve specific narrative functions. Superficial swaps may lose the function or import problematic assumptions to new contexts.
**Fix:** Understand why cultural elements existed in the original. Create new elements that serve the same narrative function while emerging naturally from the new setting.

### 5. The Unexplored Implication
**Pattern:** Translating an element without considering how it would actually work in the new context. "They use swords because the original had swords" in a setting with abundant energy weapons.
**Why it fails:** Breaks world coherence. Audiences ask "why don't they just..." constantly. The adaptation feels like it wasn't thought through.
**Fix:** Run each translated element through consequence cascade. If it doesn't make sense in context, find what DOES make sense that serves the same function.

## Integration Points

**Inbound:**
- When adapting existing media to new settings
- When analyzing what makes stories work
- When developing genre mashups

**Outbound:**
- To worldbuilding for new settings
- To character development within adapted structures
- To plot development using translated conflicts

**Complementary:**
- `dna-extraction`: For more detailed functional analysis
- `adaptation-synthesis`: For combining multiple source extractions
- `worldbuilding`: For developing the target setting
