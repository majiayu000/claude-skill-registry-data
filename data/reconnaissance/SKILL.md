## TIER 1: CRITICAL SECTIONS

### Overview

Reconnaissance is a systematic intelligence-gathering skill designed to extract actionable insights from diverse sources including GitHub repositories, academic papers, competitive products, and market landscapes. Unlike general research which synthesizes existing knowledge, reconnaissance actively probes, extracts, and structures novel intelligence for strategic decision-making.

The skill operates on the principle that raw information must be transformed through structured extraction into decision-ready artifacts. It employs a three-phase methodology: Discovery (identify sources), Extraction (pull structured data), and Analysis (synthesize intelligence).

Reconnaissance is essential for:
- Pre-project feasibility assessments
- Technology stack evaluation
- Competitive positioning
- Academic literature mining for implementation patterns
- Market opportunity identification

### Core Principles

Reconnaissance operates on 5 fundamental principles:

#### Principle 1: Source Diversification
Never rely on a single source type. Cross-reference findings across repositories, papers, documentation, and market signals.

**In Practice:**
- Query GitHub + arXiv + product pages for any technology assessment
- Compare stated claims against actual implementations
- Verify recency and maintenance status of all sources

#### Principle 2: Structured Extraction
Raw information is useless without structure. Every reconnaissance output must follow defined schemas.

**In Practice:**
- Use MANIFEST.md templates for repository extractions
- Create comparison charts for multi-source analysis
- Tag all findings with source, date, and confidence level

#### Principle 3: Evidence Grounding
Every claim must trace back to a verifiable source with explicit confidence ceiling.

**In Practice:**
- Link directly to code files, paper sections, or documentation pages
- Apply confidence ceilings: witnessed (0.95), reported (0.70), inferred (0.70)
- Mark gaps explicitly rather than inferring without evidence

#### Principle 4: Actionable Output
Intelligence must drive decisions. Abstract findings without recommendations waste effort.

**In Practice:**
- End every recon with specific recommendations
- Include effort estimates and risk assessments
- Prioritize findings by strategic impact

#### Principle 5: Temporal Awareness
Technology landscapes change rapidly. All reconnaissance has an expiration date.

**In Practice:**
- Date-stamp all outputs prominently
- Note last-commit dates for repositories
- Flag papers older than 2 years as potentially outdated

### When to Use

**Use Reconnaissance When:**
- Evaluating a new technology for adoption
- Analyzing competitor products or approaches
- Extracting implementation patterns from papers
- Assessing open-source project viability
- Mapping market landscape before product decisions
- Pre-mortem analysis for project risks

**Do NOT Use Reconnaissance When:**
- Synthesizing already-gathered sources (use `literature-synthesis`)
- Single-source deep reading (use `academic-reading-workflow`)
- General question answering (use `researcher`)
- Implementation planning (use `research-driven-planning`)

### Main Workflow

#### Phase 1: Scope Definition
**Agent:** intent-analyzer
**Purpose:** Clarify reconnaissance objectives and boundaries

**Inputs:**
- Target domain or technology
- Strategic questions to answer
- Time and depth constraints
- Output format requirements

**Outputs:**
- Scoped reconnaissance brief
- Source categories to probe
- Success criteria

#### Phase 2: Source Discovery
**Agent:** research-agent
**Purpose:** Identify and qualify sources

**Process:**
1. GitHub search for repositories matching domain
2. arXiv/papers search for academic sources
3. Product/company identification for competitive analysis
4. Documentation and blog discovery
5. Source qualification (recency, authority, relevance)

**Outputs:**
- Qualified source list with metadata
- Source-type distribution analysis
- Gap identification (what sources are missing?)

#### Phase 3: Structured Extraction
**Agent:** code-extractor or document-analyst
**Purpose:** Pull structured data from each source

**Process:**
1. Apply extraction template per source type:
   - Repository: MANIFEST.md (structure, deps, patterns)
   - Paper: KEY-FINDINGS.md (methods, results, code availability)
   - Product: FEATURE-MATRIX.md (capabilities, pricing, integration)
2. Normalize extracted data to common schema
3. Cross-reference overlapping claims

**Outputs:**
- Per-source extraction documents
- Normalized data tables
- Cross-reference matrix

#### Phase 4: Intelligence Synthesis
**Agent:** synthesis-agent
**Purpose:** Transform extractions into actionable intelligence

**Process:**
1. Identify patterns across sources
2. Surface contradictions and gaps
3. Generate comparison charts
4. Formulate recommendations with confidence ceilings
5. Create decision frameworks

**Outputs:**
- COMPREHENSIVE-ANALYSIS.md
- COMPARISON-CHART.md
- RECOMMENDATIONS.md with action items
- **GAP-INVENTORY.md** with specific missing capabilities

#### Phase 5: Gap-Filling Extraction (CRITICAL)
**Agent:** code-extractor + research-agent
**Purpose:** Find external repos/research to fill discovered gaps, extract ONLY applicable parts, delete everything else

**Process:**
1. **Gap Identification:** Take gaps from Phase 4 GAP-INVENTORY.md
2. **Source Discovery:** Search GitHub/arXiv/papers for solutions to each gap
3. **Pre-Mortem Analysis:** Before cloning, assess applicability:
   - Does target project already have this capability?
   - Is the architecture compatible?
   - What's the integration effort?
4. **Selective Clone:** Clone promising repos to temp directory
5. **Extraction Criteria:** For each cloned repo, evaluate:
   ```
   KEEP if:
   - Directly fills identified gap
   - Architecture compatible with target
   - Integration effort < gap severity

   DELETE if:
   - Target already has equivalent functionality
   - Architecture incompatible
   - Duplicates existing capabilities
   - Integration effort exceeds value
   ```
6. **Focused Extraction:** Extract ONLY applicable patterns:
   - Copy relevant source files to extraction folder
   - Create integration notes per extracted component
   - Map extracted code to target project structure
7. **Cleanup:** Delete cloned repos after extraction complete
8. **Extraction Report:** Document what was kept, what was deleted, and why

**Outputs:**
- `{target}-gap-extractions/` folder with:
  - Extracted source files (only applicable ones)
  - `EXTRACTION-MANIFEST.md` - what was extracted and why
  - `INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` - how to integrate each component
  - `DELETED-SUMMARY.md` - what was NOT applicable (with reasons)
- Updated GAP-INVENTORY.md with extraction status

**Critical Rules:**
1. NEVER extract without pre-mortem applicability analysis
2. ALWAYS delete more than you keep (80%+ deletion rate is healthy)
3. Document every deletion decision for future reference
4. Map extractions to specific gaps they fill

#### Phase 6: Delivery and Storage
**Agent:** delivery-agent
**Purpose:** Package and preserve intelligence

**Process:**
1. Organize outputs in dated folder structure:
   ```
   {target}-recon-{date}/
     EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md
     MANIFEST.md
     COMPREHENSIVE-ANALYSIS.md
     COMPARISON-CHART.md
     RECOMMENDATIONS.md
     GAP-INVENTORY.md
     gap-extractions/
       EXTRACTION-MANIFEST.md
       INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md
       DELETED-SUMMARY.md
       extracted-files/
   ```
2. Update memory-mcp with key findings
3. Generate executive summary
4. Archive raw extractions for audit trail

**Outputs:**
- Complete reconnaissance package with gap extractions
- Memory-mcp entries for future retrieval
- Executive brief for stakeholders
- Actionable extraction folder ready for integration

1. Historical baseline (2+ years ago)
2. Recent developments (6-24 months)
3. Current state (last 6 months)
4. Emerging signals (preprints, announcements)

#### Confidence Cascading
Layer confidence based on source quality:
```
witnessed:code-analysis     -> conf:0.95
witnessed:doc-extraction    -> conf:0.90
reported:paper-claims       -> conf:0.85
reported:blog-posts         -> conf:0.70
inferred:trend-analysis     -> conf:0.65
```

### Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Single-Source Reliance** | Biased or incomplete view | Always cross-reference 3+ sources |
| **Recency Blindness** | Outdated recommendations | Check last-commit/publish dates prominently |
| **Claim Inflation** | Overstating source confidence | Apply strict ceiling discipline |
| **Feature List Syndrome** | Listing without analysis | Always include strategic implications |
| **Extraction Without Synthesis** | Raw data dumps | Require actionable conclusions |
| **Scope Creep** | Unbounded reconnaissance | Time-box and scope strictly upfront |

### Practical Guidelines

#### Full vs. Quick Reconnaissance

| Aspect | Quick Recon (2-4h) | Full Recon (1-2 days) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Sources | 3-5 primary | 10-20 comprehensive |
| Depth | Surface extraction | Deep analysis |
| Output | Single summary | Full package |
| Use When | Time-sensitive decisions | Strategic planning |

#### Quality Checkpoints
- [ ] Every claim has source link
- [ ] Confidence ceilings applied consistently
- [ ] Date stamps on all documents
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable
- [ ] Gaps explicitly identified

#### Trade-offs
- **Breadth vs. Depth:** Quick decisions need breadth; implementation needs depth
- **Speed vs. Accuracy:** Higher confidence requires more cross-referencing
- **Comprehensiveness vs. Actionability:** Too much data obscures recommendations
