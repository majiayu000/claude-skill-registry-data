# Executive Briefing Kit Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing board/ELT updates on competitive threats and market shifts.
- Summarizing key intel for quarterly business reviews or deal war rooms.
- Aligning cross-functional leaders on immediate actions + investments.

## Framework
1. **Story Arc** – context, signal summary, threat/opportunity framing, recommended plays.
2. **Evidence Layer** – data, quotes, visuals, scorecards, customer anecdotes.
3. **Action Register** – decisions required, owner, due date, confidence level, resource ask.
4. **Escalation Hooks** – highlight urgent risks, exec sponsors, and escalation paths.
5. **Follow-up Cadence** – timeline for progress updates, KPI tracking, and retrospectives.

## Templates
- One-page exec brief + appendix outline.
- Slide template with signal cards, impact matrix, and action tracker.
- Decision log template for recording commitments + rationale.

## Tips
- Lead with business impact before diving into tactical intel.
- Include “what we need from you” explicitly to unlock fast decisions.
- Use with `analyze-competitive-landscape` and `build-battlecard-suite` for cohesive storytelling.
