# Analytics Visualization Patterns Skill

## When to Use
- Planning a new dashboard or updating existing visualizations.
- Coaching teams on self-serve analytics adoption.
- Auditing visual design, accessibility, and narrative clarity.

## Framework
1. **Audience & Story** – clarify persona, decision cadence, and key questions.
2. **Layout & Hierarchy** – organize tiles by funnel (overview → drill-down → diagnostic), highlight KPIs.
3. **Chart Selection** – match metric type to chart (trend, composition, comparison, distribution).
4. **Accessibility** – color contrast, labels, tooltips, mobile/responsive considerations.
5. **Narrative & Actions** – annotate insights, embed CTA buttons or playbook links.

## Templates
- Dashboard wireframe grid with KPI slots.
- Metric dictionary (definition, source, owner, refresh schedule).
- Adoption checklist (stakeholder review, enablement session, feedback form).

## Tips
- Keep hero KPIs at top-left with trend vs target.
- Use consistent color palettes for good/bad variance.
- Embed documentation or Loom walkthroughs directly in BI tool when possible.
