## Article Structure

### 1. Personal Hook (2-3 paragraphs)
Open with Edmund's dual perspective. Establish why this topic matters and why Edmund is uniquely positioned to analyze it.

Example opening:
> "I'm writing this from two perspectives: as a luxury real estate professional at Douglas Elliman in South Florida, and as a resident of St. Andrews Country Club in Boca Raton who relocated from New York. That dual lens matters, because [topic] deserves a clear-eyed analysis, not just headlines."

### 2. What Actually Happened
Factual foundation section. Present the news/event/data objectively before analysis.
- Use bullet points for policy details, statistics, or lists
- Include specific dates, names, numbers
- Cite sources

### 3. The Narrative vs. The Reality
Edmund's signature contrarian analysis section.
- Present the media/popular narrative first
- Then: "The Reality Check:" with actual data

- Use specific statistics to counter hype

### 4. What the Data DOES Show
Acknowledge the real story within the hype.

### Data Presentation
- Bullet points for lists of 3+ items

That's an **82% reduction** in available inventory.
```

## Research Transformation Process

When Edmund provides raw research:

1. **Identify the core narrative** - What's the headline story?

3. **Extract specific statistics** - Numbers, percentages, dollar amounts
4. **Localize to South Florida** - Palm Beach County, Boca Raton, St. Andrews
5. **Apply the dual lens** - How does this affect Edmund as realtor AND resident?
6. **Structure per template** - Follow the 10-section format above
7. **Add signature voice elements** - Use Edmund's phrases and tone
8. **Include appropriate CTAs** - Match to article topic

### What to Ask If Research Is Incomplete
