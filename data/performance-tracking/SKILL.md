# Performance Tracking Skill

## When to Use
- Before launch to define metrics, data sources, and reporting cadence.
- During active campaigns to monitor pacing vs goals and trigger optimizations.
- Post-campaign retros to capture learnings and benchmarks.

## Framework
1. **Metric Hierarchy** – define business (pipeline, revenue), leading (MQL, CTR), and diagnostic metrics (CPC, landing page CVR).
2. **Data Plumbing** – map sources (ad platforms, MA, CRM, BI) and ensure consistent IDs/UTMs.
3. **Dashboard Build** – create executive + operator views with automated refresh.
4. **Alerting** – set thresholds for spend pacing, CPA, conversion drops, SLAs.
5. **Insight Cadence** – daily standups, weekly deep dives, end-of-campaign retros.
6. **Documentation** – record hypotheses, experiments, and outcomes.

## Templates
- KPI tree worksheet.
- Dashboard spec (dataset, visualization, owner, refresh schedule).
- Optimization log (date, insight, action, result).

## Tips
- Automate alert routing (Slack, email) so anomalies are actioned quickly.
- Pair dashboards with narrative summaries to help execs interpret shifts.
- Capture experiment context in the optimization log to prevent repeating failed tests.
- Align BI/RevOps early so new metrics get logged before launch.
