# Video Caption Writer

## Purpose

This skill creates algorithm-optimized captions and on-screen text for short-form video content using the "Triple Word Score" system to maximize reach and engagement.

**Core Philosophy:** Content serves the topic first. When you serve the topic correctly, algorithms will serve your content to people interested in that topic.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create on-screen text hooks for video clips (3-5 options per clip)
- Write captions for short-form video (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts, etc.)
- Optimize video for algorithm discovery (topic identification in first 10 seconds)
- Generate strategic hashtag sets (10-12, broad to specific)

**Do NOT use for:**
- Text-only social posts (use `social-content-creation` skill instead)
- Long-form YouTube videos (separate workflow)
- Podcast show notes (separate podcast workflow)

## The Triple Word Score System

Algorithms and humans need to immediately understand your content through FOUR signals:

### 1. Audio Transcript (MOST IMPORTANT)
- **What you say out loud** - algorithms auto-transcribe this
- Explicitly say topic words in first 10 seconds
- Repeat core terminology throughout
- Use natural speech patterns with topic-relevant vocabulary

### 2. On-Screen Text Reinforcement
- **Visual overlay** that reinforces spoken words
- Lead with topic words in first text overlay
- Use bold, clear terminology
- Don't compete with audio - reinforce it

### 3. Caption Copy Optimization
- **Post description** with topic-relevant keywords
- Open with topic-relevant phrases in first sentence
- Include natural keyword variations
- Provide context for algorithm understanding

### 4. Strategic Hashtag System
- **10-12 hashtags** (optimal range)
- Mix broad and specific (#Productivity + #TimeManagement)
- Include audience-specific (#Entrepreneurs)
- Span from general to niche

**When all four signals align, algorithms AND humans immediately recognize: "This is for me."**

## The 3-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Generate On-Screen Text Hooks

**Goal:** Create 3-5 hook options that stop the scroll in first 3 seconds

#### The McDonald's Test
> "Someone who works at McDonald's should be able to read and understand your headline instantly."

- Avoid fancy vocabulary ("optimization paradigm" vs "work smarter not harder")
- Choose accessible language over impressive terminology
- Wider net = better performance

#### Hook Categories

**1. Polarizing Statements**
- "Your [perceived weakness] is actually your superpower"
- "Stop chasing [common goal everyone pursues]"
- "[Respected institution] operates like [controversial comparison]"

**2. Counter-Intuitive Reveals**
- "My first attempt failed. Perfect."
- "The worst experiences are the best teachers"
- "Everyone has genius hiding somewhere"

**3. Direct Challenges**
- "Never give up on the outliers"
- "Don't judge people by their [surface trait]"
- "Make your audience love [topic] again"

**4. Curiosity Gaps**
- "Her boyfriend freaked out..." (for dramatic content)
- "The third tip will blow your mind"
- Use carefully - can create confusion if unclear

#### Generate 3-5 Options

For each video clip, create file: `[Clip Name]_Captions.md`

**Format:**

```markdown
# [Clip Name] - Caption Options

## Source Material
[Brief description of video content, key quote, or main message]

## On-Screen Text Hook Options (First 3 Seconds):

**Option 1:** Your biggest weakness is actually your superpower
- **Framework:** Polarizing Statement

**Option 2:** Stop chasing perfection. Try this instead.
- **Framework:** Direct Challenge

**Option 3:** The one thing experts get wrong about creativity
- **Framework:** Curiosity Gap

**Option 4:** Most advice teaches compliance. This teaches results.
- **Framework:** Contrast/Counter-Intuitive

**Option 5:** 3 reasons your "bad habit" might be genius
- **Framework:** Numbered List + Counter-Intuitive

**RECOMMENDED:** Option 1 (Polarizing) for Short-Form, Option 4 (Contrast) for LinkedIn
```

#### Quality Check for Hooks
- [ ] Would this make ME stop scrolling?
- [ ] Creates curiosity or emotion in 2 seconds?
- [ ] Can my grandmother understand instantly?
- [ ] Hints at payoff without giving it away?
- [ ] Passes McDonald's Test (accessible language)?

### Step 2: Create Platform-Specific Captions

**Goal:** Write optimized captions for each target platform

### Short-Form Video Platforms (Identical Treatment)

**Applies to:** YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok, Facebook Reels

- **Character Limit:** 2,200 (use 50-150 characters optimal)
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 (include platform tag: #Shorts for YouTube)
- **Tone:** Casual, energetic, hook in first few words
- **Example:** "Your biggest weakness might be your superpower 💡 #Productivity #Mindset #Growth"

**Key:** Hook immediately, use emojis, keep text scannable

---

### LinkedIn (Separate Strategy)

**Platform-Specific Guidelines:**

- **Character Limit:** 3,000 (use 150-300 characters optimal)
- **Hashtags:** 3-5
- **Tone:** Professional yet conversational, value-driven
- **Format:** Hook → insight → CTA (save, comment, share)
- **Example:** "Your so-called 'weakness' might be teaching you more than any course. Constraints build creativity and resourcefulness. #Productivity #Mindset #GrowthMindset"

**Note:** For LinkedIn posts, use the `social-content-creation` skill instead of this skill.

#### Platform-Specific Caption Template

```markdown
## Short-Form Video Captions

### YouTube Shorts / Instagram Reels / TikTok / Facebook Reels
Your biggest weakness is actually your superpower 💡

Traditional advice teaches compliance. This teaches results.

#Productivity #Mindset #Growth #Success

---

### LinkedIn (Use social-content-creation skill)
Your so-called "weakness" might be teaching you more than any course.

Constraints force creativity, problem-solving, and resourcefulness. Traditional advice teaches compliance. Real growth comes from embracing what makes you different.

#Productivity #Mindset #GrowthMindset
```

### Step 3: Apply Algorithm Optimization

**Goal:** Ensure content is discoverable and serves the right audience

#### Topic Identification Checklist

**First 10 Seconds (Critical):**
- [ ] Topic words spoken explicitly in audio
- [ ] On-screen text reinforces topic words
- [ ] Visual elements support topic (environment, materials, context)
- [ ] Energy/delivery matches topic expectations

**Throughout Video:**
- [ ] Core terminology repeated naturally
- [ ] Topic focus maintained (not scattered across multiple topics)
- [ ] Value delivered on topic promise

**Caption & Metadata:**
- [ ] Caption opens with topic-relevant phrase
- [ ] Natural keyword variations included
- [ ] Hashtags span broad to specific (10-12 total)
- [ ] Description provides context for algorithm

#### Strategic Hashtag System

**Formula: Broad → Mid → Specific → Niche**

**Example for productivity content:**

**Broad (1-2):** #Productivity #Success

**Mid (2-3):** #TimeManagement #PersonalDevelopment #WorkSmarter

**Specific (3-4):** #DeepWork #FocusHacks #MorningRoutine #ProductivityTips

**Niche (2-3):** #SolopreneurLife #RemoteWorkTips #DigitalNomad

**Audience (1-2):** #Entrepreneurs #Freelancers

**Platform (1):** #Shorts (for YouTube), #Reels (for Instagram)

**Total: 10-12 hashtags**

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Misleading Signal Trap**
- Topic says "education" but content is really entertainment
- ✅ Fix: Topic signals match actual content value

**❌ Buried Lede**
- Topic words don't appear until middle of content
- ✅ Fix: Topic identification happens in first 10 seconds

**❌ Scatter Shot**
- Trying to cover multiple topics in one piece
- ✅ Fix: Laser focus on one clear topic per piece

**❌ Brand First Approach**
- Making content about your brand/company
- ✅ Fix: Making content about the topic, featuring your expertise

❌ Misleading hooks that don't match content

**Platform Issues:**
