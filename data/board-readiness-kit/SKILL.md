# Board Readiness Kit Skill

## When to Use
- Drafting quarterly board/investor updates linked to GTM + product metrics.
- Equipping execs with consistent KPI stories, risks, and asks.
- Coordinating cross-functional data pulls for diligence requests.

## Framework
1. **Story Spine** – headline, KPI movement, driver analysis, implication, ask.
2. **Metric Stack** – ARR, NRR, CAC payback, pipeline coverage, product activation, roadmap velocity.
3. **Evidence Locker** – telemetry charts, customer wins/losses, pipeline snapshots, product launch stats.
4. **Action Register** – funding requests, hiring plans, roadmap trade-offs, go/no-go decisions.
5. **Distribution Plan** – deck/memo templates, Q&A prep, and follow-up tracker.

## Templates
- **Board Deck Outline**: See `templates/board_deck_outline.md` for slide structure.
- **Memo template** for async updates.
- **Decision log sheet** capturing approvals, blockers, and owners.

## Tips
- Keep slide copy concise; push deep dives to appendix or data room.
- Pre-wire risk sections with mitigation steps to build confidence.
- Pair with `prepare-board-readout` for automation + data pulls.
