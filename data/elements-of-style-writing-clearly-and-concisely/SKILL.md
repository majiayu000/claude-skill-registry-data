# Writing Clearly and Concisely

## Overview

**NOTE:** `elements-of-style.md` is now condensed to ~1,400 tokens while preserving all essential rules.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill whenever you write prose for humans:

- Documentation, README files, technical explanations
- Commit messages, pull request descriptions
- Error messages, UI copy, help text, comments
- Reports, summaries, or any explanation
- Editing to improve clarity

If you're writing sentences for a human to read, use this skill.

## How to Use
