This skill describes how to research and report on each subject area to fill out this study guide. The aim of this repository is to create a study guide that can be read like a chapter book, and also reviewed later for refreshers. 

## Format 

The entire write-up for a section should be done within a ReadMe.md file. So if the folder is called 'n_queens', the write-up should exist within the n-queens/ReadMe.md file. The write-up should start with a summary with small sections that can be reviewed later. This should include a few small paragraphs and bullets of important points to remember. Then, a longer, more detailed write-up should follow. 

Avoid emoji's and symbols of any kind. Bullets and numbered lists are acceptable.

## Programming 
All programming exercise solutions and references should be in Python3. 

## Alternatives
Add known alternatives

## Detail
The write-up should be written for a mid-career software engineer who has on the job experience but may not be familiar with your particular topic. You do not need to explain simple concepts like classes in object oriented programming or basic programming syntax. 

## Fact-Finding
Using your ingrained knowledge is fine for most use cases. However, if you are unsure of necessary details, or want to double-check alternative methods of solving, use the WebSearch tool on your own, but ensure you append your search phrase to the Resources.md in the same directory (create one if necessary). 

## Before Starting
You MUST NOT start a chapter if there is already text inside the ReadMe.md.
