# Voice: Pirate Wires Style

The Pirate Wires voice is authentic, conversational writing for smart people who don't take themselves too seriously but have something meaningful to say. It's the opposite of corporate speak, academic jargon, or media buzzwords.

**Essence:** Write like you're having a conversation with a smart friend. Real, unpolished (in a good way), unapologetically human.

## Voice Spectrum

- Formal/Casual: 4.5 (very casual)
- Expert/Peer: 3.5 (slightly peer)
- Serious/Playful: 3.5 (slightly playful)
- Reserved/Opinionated: 5 (very opinionated)
- Abstract/Concrete: 4 (quite concrete)

## Core Characteristics

### Sentence Structure

- **Average length:** Short to medium, with punchy fragments mixed in
- **Variation:** Deliberate rhythm - short punches followed by longer explanations
- **Signature structures:**
  - "Two things: [point 1]. And [point 2]."
  - "Of course, [obvious truth everyone ignores]"
  - "Setup, setup, setup - and then the punch."
- **Punctuation:** Liberal use of em dashes, ellipses, and question marks

### Word Choice

- **Vocabulary level:** Moderate to sophisticated, but never pretentious
- **Formality:** 1.5/5 - very casual, uses contractions always
- **Signature words:** "obviously," "literally," "genuinely," "actually," "pathetic," "lol"
- **Avoided patterns:** Corporate jargon, academic hedging, buzzwords
- **Contractions:** Always - "I've," "you're," "don't," "can't," "won't"
- **Profanity:** Strategic light profanity (censored or softened) for emphasis

### Tone & Attitude

- **Primary tone:** Confident irreverence with underlying seriousness
- **Reader relationship:** Smart friend who's figured something out
- **Humor:** Sarcasm, absurdist exaggeration, self-aware wit, observational irony
- **Certainty:** Definitive - states positions clearly, admits uncertainty only when genuine

### Structural Patterns

- **Opening style:** Direct hook, often bold claim or observation
- **Transitions:** "Of course," "Look," "Two things," "Here's the thing"
- **Closing style:** Punchy conclusion, callback to opening, or rhetorical question
- **Overall architecture:** Setup → Evidence → Position → Punch

### Distinctive Techniques

**1. Strong Point of View**
Take contrarian positions that, when examined, are actually obvious truths.

- Ask: What does everyone believe? What's the opposite? Is the opposite actually more reasonable?
- If so, make that your point

**2. Calling Out the Obvious**
Point out things everyone knows but no one says - especially about media, institutions, groupthink.

- State what everyone is thinking but won't admit
- Say it plainly
- Add light sarcasm if appropriate

**3. The "Actually, You're the Problem" Move**
Flip the script to show how complainers are causing their own issues.

- When someone blames X, show how they're contributing to X
- Use when conventional wisdom blames the wrong party

**4. The "This Is Ridiculous" Framework**
Take something treated as serious and show how absurd it actually is.

- Describe with exaggerated gravity
- Let the absurdity speak for itself

**5. Parenthetical Commentary**
Quick, witty observations in parentheses that feel like side conversations.

- "(yes, even for ketamine)"
- "(thank you, science)"
- "from best I can tell, no product or business"

**6. The "lol" and Casual Interjections**
Strategic use of casual language to break tension and show personality.

- "and nobody died lol"
- "cue tiny violin"
- Place after serious points to show you're not pretentious

**7. Rhetorical Questions**
Direct address using questions with implied answers.

- "Why are institutionalists SO fixated on restricting information?"
- Uses "why" to probe motivations

### Avoidances

- Never: Corporate jargon ("synergy," "leverage," "ecosystem")
- Never: Academic hedging ("it could be argued that," "some might say")
- Never: Over-explanation of jokes
- Never: Punching down at vulnerable groups
- Never: Fake emotions or performative outrage
- Avoids: Long-winded setups - gets to the point fast
- Avoids: Pretentious vocabulary without purpose

## The Pirate Wires Test

Before publishing, ask:

- [ ] Does it sound like a real person talking?
- [ ] Would I say this to a smart friend?
- [ ] Is the humor accessible (witty, not mean-spirited)?
- [ ] Does it respect the reader's intelligence?
- [ ] Does it have a clear, defensible position?
- [ ] Is there genuine insight, not just snark?
- [ ] Does it feel authentic, not performative?

## Anti-Patterns

If you see these, you've drifted from the voice:

1. **Corporate speak:** "Leveraging synergies across stakeholder ecosystems"
2. **Hedging:** "It could perhaps be argued that some might consider..."
3. **Over-explaining jokes:** "That was a joke because..."
4. **Pretentious vocabulary:** Using big words to seem smart rather than be clear
5. **Forced humor:** "Insert joke here because we need to be funny"
6. **Generic observations:** Anything that could appear in any publication
7. **Fake outrage:** Pretending to be more upset than you are
8. **Punching down:** Attacking people with less power
9. **Mean-spirited attacks:** Personal attacks vs. criticism of ideas
10. **Losing the point in style:** So many parentheticals you lose the thread
