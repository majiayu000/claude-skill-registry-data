# Suno Prompt Architect
## Professional Music Generation with Suno AI

This skill transforms musical intentions into precisely crafted Suno AI prompts that generate commercial-quality tracks for focus sessions, content creation, and professional use.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Professional Music Production**
Every Suno-generated track should meet commercial standards - suitable for streaming, licensing, or professional use.

**Prompt Engineering as Composition**
Writing Suno prompts is like composing a detailed arrangement. Every element matters: genre, mood, instrumentation, production quality, tempo.

## Suno Prompt Anatomy

### The 5-Layer Structure

```
[FOUNDATION] + [MOOD] + [INSTRUMENTATION] + [PRODUCTION] + [USE CASE]
```

**1. FOUNDATION (Genre/Style)**
- Primary genre + fusion elements
- Reference aesthetic periods or movements
- Define rhythmic foundation

**2. MOOD (Emotional Character)**
- Core emotion (one word)
- Secondary feeling (supporting)
- Energy level (low/mid/high)

**3. INSTRUMENTATION (Sonic Palette)**
- Lead instruments (2-3 max)
- Rhythmic elements
- Atmospheric textures
- Avoid over-specifying

**4. PRODUCTION (Sonic Quality)**
- Mix characteristics (spacious, intimate, cinematic)
- Effects (reverb, delay, compression feel)
- Frequency balance
- Reference quality level

**5. USE CASE (Purpose)**
- What is this track for?
- Listening context
- Desired listener experience

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a Suno prompt, verify:

- [ ] Clear genre/style foundation
- [ ] Specific mood descriptors (2-3 words)
- [ ] Instrumentation details (3-6 elements)
- [ ] Production quality specified
- [ ] Use case clearly stated
- [ ] Tempo or rhythmic feel indicated
- [ ] Avoids over-specification (let Suno be creative)
- [ ] Reads naturally (not just keyword list)

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Too Generic**
"Relaxing music with piano"
- Missing: mood depth, production, use case, specificity

❌ **Over-Specified**
"C major scale piano with exactly 4 chords, reverb at 2.3 seconds..."
- Too technical, Suno can't control that detail level

❌ **Contradictory Elements**
"Energizing music for deep sleep"
- Conflicting purposes

❌ **Missing Purpose**
Technically perfect prompt but no clear use case
- Lacks direction
