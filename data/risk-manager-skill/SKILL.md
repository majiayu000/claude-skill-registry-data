## Examples

### Example 1: Financial Risk Assessment

**Scenario:** A bank needs to assess credit risk for a new lending product.

**Implementation:**
1. Built credit scoring model using historical data
2. Implemented probability of default (PD) calculations
3. Created loss given default (LGD) estimates
4. Developed exposure at default (EAD) models
5. Calculated unexpected loss capital requirements

**Results:**
- Accurate risk-based pricing implemented
- Portfolio loss projections within 5% of actual
- Regulatory capital optimized by 15%
- Clear risk appetite limits established

### Example 2: Operational Risk Framework

**Scenario:** A technology company needs to establish operational risk management.

**Implementation:**
1. Identified operational risk categories (fraud, IT, compliance, etc.)
2. Designed risk assessment methodology (Likelihood x Impact)
3. Created risk register with 200+ identified risks
4. Implemented key risk indicators (KRIs)
5. Established risk escalation procedures

**Results:**
- Comprehensive risk landscape mapped
- 15 high-priority risks addressed proactively
- Risk culture embedded in operations
- Audit findings reduced by 40%

### Example 3: Third-Party Risk Management

**Scenario:** Managing risk from 50+ vendors and suppliers.

**Implementation:**
1. Developed vendor risk classification framework
2. Created due diligence questionnaires
3. Implemented continuous monitoring program

## Anti-Patterns

### Risk Assessment Anti-Patterns

- **Risk Blindness**: Not identifying all relevant risks - comprehensive risk identification
- **Subjective Scoring**: Risk ratings without methodology - use quantitative methods
- **Static Risk View**: Risk assessments never updated - regular risk reviews
- **Siloed Risk**: Risks viewed in isolation - consider risk interdependencies

### Risk Modeling Anti-Patterns

- **Model Over-Confidence**: Blind trust in models - validate and stress test
- **Historical Bias**: Assuming past patterns continue - consider tail risks
- **Correlation Ignorance**: Ignoring risk correlations - model joint tail events
- **Parameter Staleness**: Using outdated model parameters - regular model updates

### Mitigation Anti-Patterns

- **Treat Everything**: Over-investing in low-priority risks - prioritize mitigation efforts
- **Control Theater**: Controls that exist but don't work - test control effectiveness
- **Mitigation Gap**: Plans without execution - track mitigation to completion
- **Transfer Illusion**: Insurance or transfer without understanding - verify coverage adequacy

### Governance Anti-Patterns

- **Risk Appetite Vacuum**: No defined risk appetite - establish clear thresholds
- **Escalation Absence**: Risks not escalating appropriately - define escalation paths
- **Siloed Ownership**: No clear risk ownership - assign accountability
- **Reporting Delay**: Risks reported too late - real-time risk monitoring
