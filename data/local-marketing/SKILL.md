## Лучшие практики

1. **NAP consistency** — одинаковое написание везде критически важно
2. **Reviews matter** — качество и количество отзывов влияют на ранжирование
3. **Local content** — создавайте уникальный контент для каждой локации
4. **Community presence** — будьте активны в локальном сообществе
5. **Mobile optimization** — большинство локальных поисков с мобильных
6. **Track everything** — используйте call tracking и attribution
