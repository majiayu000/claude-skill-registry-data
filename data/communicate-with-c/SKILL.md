## Who is the C?

C types are objective, skeptical, and logical. They value accuracy and precision above almost everything else, approaching problems with methodical analysis and a commitment to quality. They are reserved and task-oriented -- naturally drawn to data, systems, and expertise rather than social interaction. They catch errors others miss, ask probing questions, and create processes that work reliably.

## Do's

- Come prepared with data, evidence, and specifics to support your points
- Provide clear, detailed written communication when possible
- Give them time to process information before expecting a decision
- Be factual and logical in your arguments
- Prepare a clear agenda before meetings
- Respect their need for personal space and independent work time
- Be thorough and accurate in anything you present to them
- Follow through on commitments precisely as stated

## Don'ts

- Don't make claims you can't back up with data
- Don't spring unscheduled, spontaneous meetings on them
- Don't use emotional appeals instead of logical arguments
- Don't rush them into quick decisions with incomplete information
- Don't interrupt their deep focus time with unnecessary check-ins
- Don't present vague or disorganized information
- Don't dismiss their attention to detail as nitpicking
- Don't expect immediate enthusiasm or visible excitement

## Context-Specific Advice

### Meetings
Prepare a clear agenda in advance and share it before the meeting. Come with data to support your points and stick to facts and logical arguments. Schedule meetings formally when possible rather than dropping by unannounced. Give them time to process before expecting input or decisions.

### Email
Be clear, detailed, and factual. Include supporting documentation and data. Organize information logically with clear structure. Avoid vague or emotional language -- they respond to precision and specifics.

### Giving Feedback
Be specific, detailed, and objective. Deliver feedback with logical reasoning and concrete examples. Focus on facts rather than feelings, and provide data that supports your observations. They respect well-reasoned critique.

### Resolving Conflict
Use a serious, businesslike demeanor. Ask strictly objective questions and focus on the underlying issues rather than emotions. Approach resolution systematically -- present the problem, the evidence, and potential solutions in an organized way.
