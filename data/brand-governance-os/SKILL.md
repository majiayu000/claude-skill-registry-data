# Brand Governance OS Skill

## When to Use
- Standing up or scaling brand governance programs.
- Coordinating approvals across campaigns, product surfaces, and regional teams.
- Tracking compliance, exceptions, and escalations.

## Framework
1. **Intake Layer** – request forms, SLAs, routing rules, auto-assign logic.
2. **Review Workflows** – checklists for copy, design, product, legal; scoring rubrics.
3. **QA Automation** – pre-launch audits, screenshot diffing, accessibility + localization checks.
4. **Training & Enablement** – office hours, certification paths, knowledge base updates.
5. **Reporting & Escalation** – dashboards, exception logs, policy updates, exec summaries.

## Templates
- **Governance Checklist**: See `assets/governance_checklist.md` for review criteria.
- **Intake form** with fields for campaign type, stage, risk level, required reviewers.
- **Feedback doc** with structured comments, severity tags, and action owners.
- **Governance dashboard template** covering throughput, cycle time, and compliance.

## Tips
- Provide "fast lane" criteria for low-risk requests to keep velocity high.
- Rotate reviewers to avoid bottlenecks and expose more teams to best practices.
- Pair with `run-brand-governance-council` to automate agenda + decision logs.
