# Settlement Design: Urban Development Skill

You help writers create realistic settlements by applying the ten core principles that govern how real cities and towns form, grow, and evolve. This produces urban environments that feel lived-in rather than designed-for-plot.

## Core Principles

1. **Geographic Determinism**: Natural features profoundly shape settlement patterns and growth
2. **Functional Necessity**: Settlements develop to fulfill specific economic, defensive, or social needs
3. **Network Emergence**: Settlements exist within interconnected systems, not isolation
4. **Layered Development**: Urban spaces evolve through accretion rather than comprehensive planning
5. **Power Projection**: Settlement design reflects and reinforces social and political hierarchies
6. **Resource Constraint**: Available materials and technologies limit construction possibilities
7. **Cultural Expression**: Built environments embody cultural values and social organization
8. **Adaptive Reuse**: Structures and spaces are repurposed as needs change over time
9. **Disaster Response**: Settlements evolve in reaction to catastrophes
10. **Spatial Stratification**: Social hierarchies manifest in physical organization of space

## Output Persistence

### Output Discovery
1. Check for `context/output-config.md` in the project
2. If found, look for this skill's entry
3. If not found, ask user: "Where should I save settlement designs?"
4. Suggest: `worldbuilding/settlements/` or `explorations/worldbuilding/`

### Primary Output
- **Site analysis** - Geographic features and selection rationale
- **Morphology** - Street patterns, boundaries, districts
- **Historical layers** - Development phases and crisis responses
- **Infrastructure** - Water, transport, waste, food systems
- **Social geography** - Elite, common, marginalized zones

### File Naming
Pattern: `{settlement-name}-design-{date}.md`

## Verification (Oracle)

### What This Skill Can Verify
- **Scale consistency** - Do population and institutions match? (High confidence)
- **Infrastructure presence** - Are essential systems addressed? (High confidence)
- **Historical layering** - Does settlement show development over time? (Medium confidence)

### What Requires Human Judgment
- **Story fit** - Does settlement create interesting scenes?
- **Immersive quality** - Does it feel lived-in?
- **Navigation clarity** - Can readers orient themselves?

### Oracle Limitations
- Cannot assess whether settlement serves plot needs
- Cannot predict reader sense of place from descriptions

## Feedback Loop

### Session Persistence
- **Output location:** See `context/output-config.md`
- **What to save:** Site, morphology, districts, infrastructure, social zones
- **Naming pattern:** `{settlement-name}-design-{date}.md`

### Cross-Session Learning
- Check for prior settlement work in this world
- Ensure settlements maintain trade/political consistency
- Crisis response patterns inform anti-patterns

## Design Constraints

### This Skill Assumes
- Settlement exists (even ruins were once settlements)
- Writer wants functional urbanism, not stage sets
- Some historical development has occurred

### This Skill Does Not Handle
- **Economic systems** - Route to: economic-systems
- **Political structures** - Route to: governance-systems
- **Cultural texture** - Route to: memetic-depth
- **Scene staging** - Route to: scene-sequencing

### Degradation Signals
- Perfect symmetry without historical disruption
- Every element serving current plot
- Scale mismatch between population and institutions

## Reasoning Requirements

### Standard Reasoning
- Single district design
- Site selection analysis
- Basic infrastructure mapping

### Extended Reasoning (ultrathink)
- **Full city design** - [Why: all systems interconnect]
- **Historical layer development** - [Why: tracing centuries of change]
- **Multi-settlement regional design** - [Why: trade and political networks]

**Trigger phrases:** "design the complete city", "city history", "regional settlement network"

## Execution Strategy

### Sequential (Default)
- Site before morphology
- Foundation before growth phases
- Infrastructure before social geography

### Parallelizable
- Designing multiple districts
- Research into different urban analogs

### Subagent Candidates
| Task | Agent Type | When to Spawn |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Historical research | general-purpose | When modeling on real cities |
| World consistency check | Explore | When verifying against existing setting |

## Context Management

### Approximate Token Footprint
- **Skill base:** ~4k tokens (parameters + typologies)
- **With development patterns:** ~5k tokens
- **With setting adaptations:** ~6k tokens

### Context Optimization
- Focus on relevant typologies for current settlement
- Implementation process is reference, not required
- Setting adaptations load on-demand

### When Context Gets Tight
- Prioritize: Current typology, active parameters
- Defer: Full typology matrix, evolution sequences
- Drop: All setting-specific adaptations not in use

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Designer's Map Syndrome
**Pattern:** Creating settlements that look good on a map but don't reflect organic development—perfect grids, symmetrical layouts, convenient district placement.
**Why it fails:** Real cities accumulate over time through crisis, growth, and adaptation. The "designed" appearance signals artificiality. Readers sense something's off even when they can't articulate it.
**Fix:** Add at least one layer of disruption—a fire that forced rebuilding, a flood that redirected development, an invasion that destroyed the old walls. Show the scars of history in the urban fabric.

### 2. Functional Perfection
**Pattern:** Every element of the city serves the current plot—the perfect tavern for meetings, the convenient sewer for escapes, districts that exist only when characters visit.
**Why it fails:** Cities exist for their inhabitants, not for visiting protagonists. Plot-serving urbanism makes the city feel like a stage set rather than a lived environment.
**Fix:** Include elements that don't serve the plot but serve the city. Markets for goods the characters don't need. Temples to gods the characters don't worship. The city should feel like it would exist without the story.

### 3. Scale Implausibility
**Pattern:** Descriptions implying vastly different scales—a "small town" with specialized districts that would require a population of 50,000, or a "great city" that characters walk across in an hour.
**Why it fails:** Readers have intuitions about urban scale from experience. Contradictions break immersion. A hamlet can't have a thieves' guild district; a metropolis can't be crossed on foot between breakfast and lunch.
**Fix:** Choose a real-world analog for scale reference. Research population densities for your technology level. Match institutions and specializations to actual population thresholds.

### 4. Missing Infrastructure
**Pattern:** Rich descriptions of palaces and markets without mentioning where water comes from, where waste goes, or how food arrives.
**Why it fails:** Infrastructure is what makes cities possible. Its absence makes the settlement feel like a fantasy diorama rather than a functioning organism.
**Fix:** Decide how the city handles water, waste, food, and fuel. These systems shape urban form—aqueducts create neighborhoods, markets cluster near gates, tanners locate downriver.

### 5. Homogeneous Population
**Pattern:** Every neighborhood has the same feel, the same prosperity level, the same building types. No tension between rich and poor districts, old and new areas, native and immigrant quarters.
**Why it fails:** Urban texture comes from variation and contrast. The interesting parts of cities are the edges where different zones meet, where wealth borders poverty, where old meets new.
**Fix:** Design at least three distinct zones with different characters. Create transition areas where they interact. Show the tensions that arise from proximity.
