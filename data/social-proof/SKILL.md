# Social Proof Skill

## Purpose

Provides social proof patterns that build trust and increase conversions. Critical for lead generation sites to establish credibility through testimonials, reviews, trust badges, statistics, and client logos.

## Core Rules

1. **Specific over vague** — "2,347 moves" not "thousands of moves"
2. **Named over anonymous** — "Sarah M., Clifton" not "Happy Customer"
3. **Recent over old** — Show dates, keep testimonials fresh
4. **Verified over claimed** — Google reviews > self-reported
5. **Strategic placement** — Trust before conversion points
6. **Real numbers only** — All stats must be verifiable
7. **Name and location** — Full attribution builds credibility
8. **Address objections** — Testimonials answer common concerns
9. **Visual proof** — Photos, badges, logos over text claims
10. **Schema markup** — Structured data for rich snippets

## Placement Strategy

| Location | What to Show |
|----------|--------------|
| Hero | Google rating badge, review count |
| After hero | Client logos or trust badges |
| Before form | 1-2 short testimonials |
| Mid-page | Stats section |
| After features | Full testimonial carousel |
| Footer | Trust badges |

## Component Types
