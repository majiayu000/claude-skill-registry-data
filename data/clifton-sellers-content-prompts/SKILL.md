# Clifton Sellers Content Prompts

Seven prompts for serious founder-led content. These assume you have opinions and scar tissue. Without that, no prompt produces leverage.

**Core rule:** AI is vague because you are. Bring conviction and experience, not half-formed thinking.

## Prompts

| # | Prompt | Purpose |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | [Belief Stress Test](references/01-belief-stress-test.md) | Force clarity on the belief your business is built on |
| 2 | [Experience Miner](references/02-experience-miner.md) | Extract insight from lived decisions, not advice |
| 3 | [Clarity Destroyer](references/03-clarity-destroyer.md) | Eliminate vague thinking that hides behind clever language |
| 4 | [Content as Infrastructure](references/04-content-infrastructure.md) | Turn one idea into durable business asset |
| 5 | [Voice Integrity Filter](references/05-voice-integrity.md) | Protect tone and prevent artificial polish |
| 6 | [Silent Sales Map](references/06-silent-sales.md) | Ensure content reduces friction in buying decisions |
| 7 | [Weekly Operator](references/07-weekly-operator.md) | Create focus under constraint |

## Workflow

1. **Start with Belief Stress Test** - Know your beliefs before writing
2. **Mine your Experience** - Pull from decisions, not advice
3. **Draft content** - Write from conviction
4. **Run Clarity Destroyer** - Kill vague thinking
5. **Apply Voice Filter** - Remove artificial polish
6. **Check Silent Sales Map** - Verify business alignment
7. **Weekly: Run Operator** - Maintain focus
