# Skill: Write OQL Queries for Mendix VIEW Entities

## Reference files

- [`reference/patterns.md`](reference/patterns.md) — the recurring OQL shapes
  (aggregation, joins across associations, date bucketing, ranking, filtered
  counts) and a full worked query, to adapt rather than derive.

## Purpose
Generate correct OQL (Object Query Language) queries for Mendix VIEW entities. This skill helps you create VIEW entities with proper OQL syntax that will execute successfully in Mendix runtime.

## When to Use This Skill
- User asks to create a VIEW entity
- User requests help with OQL queries
- User wants to create analytics, reports, or aggregated data views
- User needs to join entities or create calculated fields
- You encounter OQL syntax errors when creating VIEW entities

## Critical OQL Syntax Rules

### 0. VIEW Entity Best Practices (CRITICAL)

**RULE 1: All SELECT columns MUST have explicit AS aliases**

Every column in the SELECT clause must have an alias that matches the entity attribute name:

```text
-- ❌ WRONG - Missing aliases
create view entity Finance.CashFlowProjection (
  ProjectionDate: datetime,
  ProjectedIncome: decimal,
  ProjectedExpense: decimal
) as (
  select
    fl.ForecastDate,              -- Missing AS alias
    fl.ProjectedIncome,           -- Missing AS alias
    fl.ProjectedExpense           -- Missing AS alias
  from Finance.ForecastLine as fl
);
```

```sql
mdl 1;
-- ✅ CORRECT - All columns have explicit aliases
create view entity Finance.CashFlowProjection (
  ProjectionDate: datetime,
  ProjectedIncome: decimal,
  ProjectedExpense: decimal
) as (
  select
    fl.ForecastDate as ProjectionDate,
    fl.ProjectedIncome as ProjectedIncome,
    fl.ProjectedExpense as ProjectedExpense
  from Finance.ForecastLine as fl
);
```

**RULE 2: `ORDER BY` requires a `LIMIT` — prefer letting the consuming query sort**

`ORDER BY` **alone** is rejected (`mxcli check` → **MDL030**; `mx check` → CE0174).
`ORDER BY` **with** a `LIMIT` is valid and builds clean — that is exactly how you
express a top-N view. As a default, prefer *no* `ORDER BY`/`LIMIT` so the UI
component or microflow can sort and paginate the same view differently; reach for
`ORDER BY … LIMIT` only when the view is intrinsically a top-N.

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG - ORDER BY without LIMIT (MDL030 / CE0174)
create view entity Finance.TopCustomers (...) as (
  select c.Name as CustomerName, sum(o.Amount) as TotalSpent
  from Finance.Customer as c
  inner join Finance.Order_Customer/Finance.Order as o
  GROUP by c.Name
  ORDER by TotalSpent desc        -- needs a LIMIT
);

-- ✅ CORRECT (preferred) - let the consuming page/microflow sort
create view entity Finance.CustomerTotals (...) as (
  select c.Name as CustomerName, sum(o.Amount) as TotalSpent
  from Finance.Customer as c
  inner join Finance.Order_Customer/Finance.Order as o
  GROUP by c.Name
);

-- ✅ ALSO VALID - an intrinsic top-N view (ORDER BY paired with LIMIT)
create view entity Finance.TopCustomers (...) as (
  select c.Name as CustomerName, sum(o.Amount) as TotalSpent
  from Finance.Customer as c
  inner join Finance.Order_Customer/Finance.Order as o
  GROUP by c.Name
  ORDER by TotalSpent desc
  LIMIT 100
);
```

**Why these rules matter:**
- **Explicit aliases**: Required for proper OQL-to-entity attribute mapping in Mendix
- **ORDER BY/LIMIT**: Omitting both keeps the view flexible (each page/microflow sorts and paginates as it needs); when you *do* sort, `ORDER BY` must be paired with `LIMIT` (MDL030)

**`UNION` / `UNION ALL` are supported** in view-entity OQL and round-trip cleanly —
use them to combine multiple row kinds in one view (e.g. category rows plus group
subtotals). Column count and types must line up across branches; `ORDER BY` (with
its `LIMIT`) applies to the whole unioned result, not a single branch.

```sql
mdl 1;
create or modify view entity Ledger.CategoryAndSubtotals (
  Label: string(100), Amount: decimal
) as (
  select c.Name as Label, sum(t.Amount) as Amount
  from Ledger.Category as c
  left join Ledger.Transaction_Category/Ledger.Transaction as t
  group by c.Name
  union all
  select 'TOTAL' as Label, sum(t.Amount) as Amount
  from Ledger.Transaction as t
);
```

### 1. Aggregate Functions (MUST BE LOWERCASE)
```sql
-- ❌ WRONG - Uppercase will fail
sum(o.Amount)
avg(o.Amount)
max(o.OrderDate)
min(o.Amount)

-- ✅ CORRECT - Lowercase
sum(o.Amount)
avg(o.Amount)
max(o.OrderDate)
min(o.Amount)
```

### 2. COUNT Function
```sql
-- ❌ WRONG - count(*) not supported in Mendix OQL
count(*)

-- ✅ CORRECT - Count by ID or entity
count(t.ID)           -- Count by ID attribute
count(t)              -- Count entity instances
```

### Aggregate Function Return Types

| Function | Input Type | Returns | MDL Declaration |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| `count(expr)` | any | Integer | `attr: integer` |
| `sum(expr)` | Integer | Integer | `attr: integer` |
| `sum(expr)` | Decimal | Decimal | `attr: decimal` |
| `avg(expr)` | any numeric | Decimal | `attr: decimal` |
| `max(expr)` / `min(expr)` | Integer | Integer | `attr: integer` |
| `max(expr)` / `min(expr)` | Decimal | Decimal | `attr: decimal` |
| `max(expr)` / `min(expr)` | DateTime | DateTime | `attr: datetime` |
| `datepart(part, expr)` | DateTime | Integer | `attr: integer` |
| `length(expr)` | String | Integer | `attr: integer` |

**Key rule**: `count()` and `avg()` have fixed return types. `sum()`, `min()`, `max()` preserve the input type.

### 3. DATEPART Function (Comma Syntax)
```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT - Use comma syntax
datepart(YEAR, t.TransactionDate)
datepart(MONTH, t.TransactionDate)
datepart(QUARTER, t.TransactionDate)
datepart(WEEK, t.TransactionDate)
datepart(DAY, t.TransactionDate)

-- ❌ WRONG - FROM syntax not supported
DATEPART(YEAR from t.TransactionDate)
```

### 4. Enumeration Comparisons (String Literals)
```sql
-- ❌ WRONG - Qualified enum names
t.TransactionType = Finance.TransactionType.INCOME
t.Status != Finance.TransactionStatus.VOID

-- ✅ CORRECT - Use string literals
t.TransactionType = 'INCOME'
t.Status != 'VOID'
```

### 5. Division Operator (Colon, not Slash)
```text
-- ❌ WRONG - Using / causes parsing errors
select amount / quantity as price
select (total - discount) * 100.0 / total as percentage

-- ✅ CORRECT - Use : for division
select amount : quantity as price
select (total - discount) * 100.0 : total as percentage
```

### 6. ORDER BY with Aliases
```text
-- ❌ WRONG - Using expressions in ORDER BY
ORDER by datepart(YEAR, t.TransactionDate) desc

-- ✅ CORRECT - Use column aliases
select
  datepart(YEAR, t.TransactionDate) as OrderYear
from Finance.Transaction as t
ORDER by OrderYear desc
```

### 6b. ORDER BY DESC on a nullable column puts the nulls FIRST

`ORDER BY <attribute> DESC` does **not** give you the newest rows when some rows
leave that attribute empty. Mendix emits the ordering with no null placement, so
the database default applies — on PostgreSQL, `DESC` means **NULLS FIRST**.

```text
-- ❌ MISLEADING - the empty rows come back first, so a top-N is not the top N
select g.Label as Label from Sudoku.Game as g
order by g.DealtAt desc
limit 5

-- ✅ CORRECT when the attribute is optional
select g.Label as Label from Sudoku.Game as g
order by g.DealtAt desc nulls last
limit 5
```

This is worth knowing because it does not look like a null problem. The result is
**stable across runs**, so it reads as "the ordering is being ignored" rather than
"the sort key is empty for some rows" — and the natural next step, falling back to
`order by id desc`, answers a different question (insertion order, which only
matches recency when nothing backdates a row).

Check before concluding anything:
`select count(*) as n from Sudoku.Game where DealtAt = empty`.

Measured on Mendix 11.13.0 / PostgreSQL: with values present, `ORDER BY` on a
DateTime is emitted to the database correctly and orders correctly. Null placement
is database-specific (SQL Server and Oracle differ), so being explicit is also the
portable choice.

### 7. Operators (Use != not <>)
```sql
-- ❌ WRONG - <> causes errors in Mendix
where t.Status <> 'VOIDED'

-- ✅ CORRECT - Use !=
where t.Status != 'VOIDED'
```

**Note:** Both `!=` and `<>` are valid in standard SQL, but Mendix OQL only accepts `!=`.

### 8. IN Expression Syntax
```sql
-- ✅ IN with value list
where t.Status in ('ACTIVE', 'PENDING', 'REVIEW')

-- ✅ IN with subquery
where t.CustomerId in (
  select c.CustomerId from Shop.Customer as c where c.IsVIP = true
)

-- ✅ Enumeration values use identifiers, not captions
where t.Priority in ('HIGH', 'CRITICAL')  -- Not 'High', 'Critical'
```

### 9. Subqueries (Scalar and Correlated)
```text
-- ✅ Scalar subquery in SELECT (returns single value)
select
  p.Name as ProductName,
  p.Price - (select avg(p2.Price) from Shop.Product as p2) as DiffFromAvg
from Shop.Product as p

-- ✅ Scalar subquery in WHERE
where p.Price > (select avg(p2.Price) from Shop.Product as p2)

-- ✅ Correlated subquery (references outer query by attribute)
select
  o.OrderNumber as OrderNumber,
  (select count(o2.OrderId) from Shop.Order as o2 where o2.CustomerId = o.CustomerId) as CustomerOrderCount
from Shop.Order as o

-- ✅ Correlated subquery via association (compare to .ID)
select
  p.Name as ProductName,
  (select pr.PriceInEuro from Shop.Price as pr
   where pr/Shop.Price_Product = p.ID
   ORDER by pr.StartDate desc limit 1) as LatestPrice
from Shop.Product as p

-- ❌ WRONG - bare alias without .ID
where pr/Shop.Price_Product = p    -- Doesn't resolve

-- ✅ CORRECT - compare to entity .ID
where pr/Shop.Price_Product = p.ID
```

### 10. Association Path Syntax
```sql
-- Association paths in OQL use '/' not '.'
-- ✅ CORRECT - slash prefix for association traversal
where l/Library.Loan_Member = m.ID
join l/Library.Loan_Book/Library.Book as b

-- ❌ WRONG - dot instead of slash
where l.Library.Loan_Member = m.ID     -- Error: does not resolve
```

### 11. JOIN Syntax (Association Traversal and ON Clause)

Mendix OQL supports both association traversal and SQL-style JOIN ON:

```sql
-- ✅ Association traversal (uses Mendix association path)
from Shop.Order as o
inner join o/Shop.Order_Customer/Shop.Customer as c

-- ✅ JOIN ON clause (SQL-style, for any condition)
from Shop.Order as o
inner join Shop.Customer as c on o.CustomerId = c.CustomerId

-- ✅ LEFT OUTER JOIN with ON clause
from Shop.Product as p
left outer join Shop.CompetitorProduct as cp on p.ProductCode = cp.ProductCode
```

**When to use each approach:**
- **Association traversal** (`alias/Module.Association/entity`): When joining on a Mendix-defined association
- **JOIN ON** (`join entity on condition`): When joining on arbitrary conditions or non-association fields

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Define VIEW Entity Schema

**Always include @Position annotation:**

```sql
/**
 * View entity description
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
 */
@position(300, 500)
create view entity Module.ViewName (
  Attribute1: type,
  Attribute2: type,
  -- ... more attributes
) as (
  -- OQL query goes here
);
```

### Step 1b: Know the two clause orders

Mendix OQL accepts the select list in either position, and mxcli reads both:

```text
-- Select-first. Write new views this way; the rest of this skill assumes it.
select c.Name as Name, count(o.ID) as Orders
from Shop.Customer as c
group by c.Name

-- From-first. Same query. This is what STUDIO PRO STORES, so it is what
-- `describe entity` gives you back — copy it, edit it, exec it unchanged.
from Shop.Customer as c
group by c.Name
select c.Name as Name, count(o.ID) as Orders
```

Note where `group by` sits: in the from-first order every clause except
`order by` / `limit` comes **before** the select list, and the grammar enforces
that. `from … select … group by …` is a parse error, not a variant.

Do not rewrite a described view into select-first just to make it look
familiar — the stored text is what MxBuild validates against, and a needless
rewrite is a diff for nothing.

### Step 1c: Selecting an id makes an ASSOCIATION, not an attribute

Selecting a persistent entity's `ID` under an alias gives the view entity an
association to that entity. The alias becomes the association's name, and the
column is **not** one of the view entity's attributes — so do not declare one
for it:

```sql
mdl 1;
create view entity Sales.OrdersVE (
  order_date: DateTime              -- one attribute…
) as (
  from Sales."Order" as o
  select o.ID        as persistent_order   -- …but two columns
       , o.OrderDate as order_date
);
```

mxcli creates the association member from that column. There is no separate
statement for it, and `create association` with a view entity at either end is
refused — Mendix rejects it (CE6771), because the association needs an
`OqlViewAssociationSource` that a plain one does not have.

Two rules:

- **The alias must be free in the module, case-insensitively.** It is the
  association's name, and Mendix reports *"Duplicate name 'Meter' in module
  'Trends'. Entities, associations and enumerations cannot share names."* So
  `as meter` beside an entity called `Meter` fails — name it `MeterRef`.
- **Reach the target through a join if it is not the FROM entity**, and select
  the id off *that* alias: `join r/Trends.Reading_Meter/Trends.Meter as m … select m.ID as MeterRef`.
- **Do not declare the id column as an attribute.** `MeterRef: Trends.Meter` (or
  `Trends.Meter.ID`) in the attribute list parses — a bare qualified name is how
  MDL spells an enumeration type — and would be stored as an enumeration naming
  an entity: CE1613 at build, or mx check failing to load the project. mxcli
  refuses it (MDL080). The attribute list holds only the non-id columns.

**Consider the flat alternative first.** An association costs a second query at
runtime — the view returns the foreign key, and the client then fetches the
referenced objects in a batched `IN (...)` per page, materialising real objects
in its state. Selecting a string copy instead is one statement, one join, no
second retrieve, and the id is still there to look the object up with:

```sql
select cast(m.ID as string) as MeterId, m.MeterCode as MeterCode, …
```

Use the association when you want to bind widgets over it (`MeterRef/MeterCode`);
use the cast when you just need the value.

### Step 2: Write SELECT Clause
- Use **lowercase** aggregate functions: `sum()`, `avg()`, `count()`
- Use `count(entity.ID)` not `count(*)`
- Create meaningful aliases for all columns
- Use `:` for division operations

### Step 3: Write FROM Clause
- Use table aliases (AS t, AS c, etc.)
- Navigate associations: `Entity_Association/TargetEntity`

### Step 4: Add JOINs if Needed
```sql
-- Association join syntax
inner join Shop.Order_Customer/Shop.Customer as c
left join Shop.Product_Category/Shop.Category as cat
```

### Step 5: Add WHERE Clause
- Use string literals for enum comparisons: `'value'`
- Use standard comparison operators: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

### Step 6: Add GROUP BY if Using Aggregates
- Include all non-aggregated columns
- Use same expressions as SELECT (e.g., `datepart()`)

### Step 7: Verify Aliases
- Ensure ALL SELECT columns have explicit AS aliases
- Aliases must match entity attribute names exactly

### Step 8: Validate Before Executing
```bash
mxcli check view.mdl -p app.mpr --references
```
This catches type mismatches (e.g., declaring `long` for a `count()` column that returns `integer`), missing module references, and OQL syntax errors — before they become MxBuild errors like CE6770 ("View Entity is out of sync with the OQL Query").

### Step 9: Final Check
- Prefer no ORDER BY/LIMIT/OFFSET — let the UI component or microflow sort and paginate
- If the view is intrinsically a top-N, ORDER BY is allowed **only when paired with a LIMIT** (MDL030 / CE0174)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Uppercase Aggregates
```sql
-- WRONG
select sum(amount) from ...

-- CORRECT
select sum(amount) from ...
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Using count(*)
```text
-- WRONG
select count(*) from Finance.Transaction

-- CORRECT
select count(t.ID) from Finance.Transaction as t
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Qualified Enum Names
```sql
-- WRONG
where t.Status = Finance.Status.ACTIVE

-- CORRECT
where t.Status = 'ACTIVE'
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: Slash for Division
```text
-- WRONG
select total / count as average

-- CORRECT
select total : count as average
```

### ❌ Mistake 5: Missing Column Aliases
```text
-- WRONG
select
  fl.ForecastDate,
  fl.ProjectedIncome
from Finance.ForecastLine as fl

-- CORRECT
select
  fl.ForecastDate as ProjectionDate,
  fl.ProjectedIncome as ProjectedIncome
from Finance.ForecastLine as fl
```

### ❌ Mistake 6: Dot Instead of Slash for Association Paths
```sql
-- WRONG - dot notation for association
where l.Library.Loan_Member = m.ID

-- CORRECT - slash notation
where l/Library.Loan_Member = m.ID
```

### ❌ Mistake 7: Bare Alias in Association Comparison
```sql
-- WRONG - comparing association to bare entity alias
where pr/Shop.Price_Product = p

-- CORRECT - compare to entity .ID
where pr/Shop.Price_Product = p.ID
```

### ❌ Mistake 8: ORDER BY without a LIMIT in a VIEW
```sql
-- WRONG - ORDER BY alone (MDL030 / CE0174)
create view entity Finance.TopItems (...) as (
  select ...
  ORDER by Amount desc          -- needs a LIMIT
);

-- CORRECT (preferred) - let the UI sort/paginate
create view entity Finance.ItemTotals (...) as (
  select ...
  -- no ORDER BY / LIMIT
);

-- ALSO VALID - an intrinsic top-N view
create view entity Finance.TopItems (...) as (
  select ...
  ORDER by Amount desc
  LIMIT 100
);
```

## Testing OQL Queries

Use `mxcli oql` to test queries against a running Mendix runtime (read-only preview mode):

```bash
# basic query (reads .docker/.env for connection settings)
mxcli oql -p app.mpr "select Name, Email from MyModule.Customer"

# json output for piping to jq
mxcli oql -p app.mpr --json "SELECT count(c.ID) FROM MyModule.Order AS c" | jq '.[0]'

# Explicit connection (no project file needed)
mxcli oql --host localhost --port 8090 --token 'AdminPassword1!' "SELECT 1"

# Test a view entity query before embedding it
mxcli oql -p app.mpr "select datepart(YEAR, o.OrderDate) as Year, sum(o.Total) as Revenue from Sales.Order as o GROUP by datepart(YEAR, o.OrderDate)"
```

The app must be running first: `mxcli docker run -p app.mpr --wait`

> **Troubleshooting**: If you get "Action not found: preview_execute_oql", the Docker stack
> needs the `-Dmendix.live-preview=enabled` JVM flag. Re-initialize with:
> `mxcli docker init -p app.mpr --force`, then restart with `mxcli docker run -p app.mpr --wait`.

### Workflow: OQL → VIEW ENTITY

1. **Write and test interactively**: `mxcli oql -p app.mpr "select ..."`
2. **Iterate** until the query returns expected results
3. **Embed** in a VIEW ENTITY with matching column aliases and attribute types
4. **Validate before executing**: `mxcli check view.mdl -p app.mpr --references` to catch type mismatches (e.g., `long` vs `integer` for `count()`)
5. **Apply and rebuild**: `mxcli exec view.mdl -p app.mpr && mxcli docker run -p app.mpr --fresh --wait`

## Integration with MDL Linter

The MDL linter checks for common OQL issues:

**Rule: `consistency/oql-syntax`**
- Validates VIEW entity OQL queries
- Checks for ORDER BY without LIMIT/OFFSET (CE0174)
- Checks for missing/empty SELECT or FROM clauses

**How to Fix Linter Errors:**
```bash
# lint a file
mendix> lint file 'path/to/file.mdl';

# Common error: ORDER by without limit
# error: view entity X: ORDER by requires limit or OFFSET. Studio Pro error: CE0174
# Fix: add limit clause
```

## Summary Checklist

When writing OQL queries for VIEW entities, always verify:

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Entity has @Position annotation (e.g., @Position(300, 500))
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: All SELECT columns have explicit AS aliases matching entity attributes
- [ ] ORDER BY omitted so the UI sorts — or, for a top-N view, ORDER BY paired with a LIMIT (MDL030 rejects ORDER BY without LIMIT)
- [ ] Aggregate functions are lowercase (`sum`, `avg`, `count`, `max`, `min`)
- [ ] Using `count(entity.ID)` not `count(*)`
- [ ] DATEPART uses comma syntax: `datepart(YEAR, field)`
- [ ] Enum comparisons use enumeration **identifiers**, not captions: `'HIGH'` not `'High'`
- [ ] IN expressions use correct syntax: `in ('VAL1', 'VAL2')` or `in (select ...)`
- [ ] Division uses colon: `amount : quantity`
- [ ] Inequality uses `!=` not `<>`
- [ ] All non-aggregated columns are in GROUP BY
- [ ] Association paths use `/` not `.`: `alias/Module.Assoc` not `alias.Module.Assoc`
- [ ] Association comparisons use `.ID`: `pr/Shop.Price_Product = p.ID` not `= p`
- [ ] Association navigation uses correct syntax: `Entity_Assoc/Target as alias`
- [ ] JOIN ON clauses use comparison operators: `on a.Field = b.Field`
- [ ] Subqueries are enclosed in parentheses and return appropriate values
- [ ] **Validate before executing**: Run `mxcli check script.mdl -p app.mpr --references` to catch type mismatches

Following these rules ensures your OQL queries will parse and execute correctly in Mendix runtime.
