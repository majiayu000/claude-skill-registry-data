# Trend Research & Culture Listening Skill

## When to Use
- Planning reactive or moment-based content.
- Refreshing creative direction for campaigns that feel stale.
- Arming leadership/content teams with timely POVs.

## Framework

### Inputs to Monitor
1. **Platform Signals** – TikTok Creative Center, Instagram Reels Trends, X trending topics, Reddit threads.
2. **Industry Signals** – Gartner/Forrester briefings, customer communities, competitor feeds.
3. **Audience Signals** – social listening alerts, community polls, support tickets.
4. **Creator Ecosystem** – emerging creators, UGC submissions, partner pitches.

### Research Process
1. Daily 15-minute scan per priority platform.
2. Document notable hooks/audio/templates in a shared tracker with shelf life + usage notes.
3. Score trends by relevance (brand fit, persona interest, risk level).
4. Recommend activation concept + guardrails (tone, compliance, required approvals).
5. Pair with content team to storyboard adaptations and distribution timing.

## Templates
- Trend bulletin (description, platform, example links, recommended angle).
- Approval checklist (brand, legal, partner).
- Creator shortlist with outreach status.
- “Trend viability” scoring sheet with fit/risk/shelf-life sliders.

## Tips
- Always capture source links/media for archival.
- Flag trends that conflict with brand safety or regulated messaging before adoption.
- Blend evergreen pillars with at most 20–30% reactive content to avoid fatigue.
