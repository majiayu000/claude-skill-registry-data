# Twitter Campaign Planner Skill

## Campaign Types

| Campaign | Duration | Goal | Key Metric |
|----------|----------|------|------------|
| Newsletter launch | 1 week | Subscriber spike | Signups |
| Content series | 2-4 weeks | Audience growth | Follower rate |
| Engagement sprint | 2 weeks | Algorithm favor | Reply rate |
| Brand awareness | Ongoing | Reach | Impressions |

## Posting Cadence

### Minimum Viable Presence
- 1 post/day for algorithm visibility
- Engage with 20+ accounts in niche daily

### Growth Mode
- 3-5 posts/day
- 2-3 long-form articles/week (Premium) — highest performing format
- 50+ meaningful replies/day ("reply guy" strategy)
- Threads optional for variety (long-form outperforms)

### Timing
- Best times: 9-11 AM, 7-9 PM (PST)
- Best days: Tuesday-Thursday
- Post when followers are online (check analytics)

## Weekly Content Mix

```
Monday: Long-form article (educational deep dive)
Tuesday: Engagement post (question, poll, hot take)
Wednesday: Long-form article (industry insight or tutorial)
Thursday: Behind-the-scenes or personal
Friday: Curated content (share others' work) or long-form
Weekend: Light engagement, replies only
```

Note: Long-form articles outperform threads. Default to long-form for educational content.

## Content Pillars for tacosdedatos

| Pillar | % of Content | Examples |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Educational | 40% | Tutorials, threads, how-tos |
| Community | 25% | Replies, shares, celebrations |
| Behind-the-scenes | 20% | Process, tools, personal |
| Promotional | 15% | Newsletter CTAs, announcements |

## The "Reply Guy" Strategy

High-effort, high-return tactic for small accounts:

```
Daily Actions:
1. Find 5-10 larger accounts in your niche (data viz, Python, Spanish tech)
2. Reply with value: insights, helpful additions, thoughtful questions
3. NOT: "Great post!" or generic agreement
4. Aim for 50+ quality replies/day

Expected Results:
- 8K+ impressions/day
- Profile visits from larger audiences
- Algorithm recognition as active participant
```

```

## Cross-Platform Coordination

When promoting across platforms:

```
Newsletter publishes →
  Twitter thread (insights) →
  LinkedIn post (professional angle) →
  Twitter reminder (2 days later) →
  Newsletter archive link
```

For tacosdedatos specifically:
- Newsletter is primary (owned audience)
- X/Twitter for reach and conversation
- LinkedIn for professional credibility
- Instagram for data viz (coordinate with Design)

## Campaign Planning Template

```markdown
# Campaign: [Name]

## Objective
[What we want to achieve]

## Duration
[Start date] - [End date]

## Target Metrics
| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Followers | X | Y |
| Avg impressions/post | X | Y |
| Newsletter signups | X | Y |

## Content Calendar

### Week 1
| Day | Content | Format | CTA |
|-----|---------|--------|-----|
| Mon | [Topic] | Thread | Follow |
| Tue | [Topic] | Poll | Engage |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Hashtag Strategy
Primary: [1-2 hashtags used consistently]

## Engagement Targets
- Replies/day: [Number]
- Accounts to engage: [List]

## Assets Needed
- [ ] Images for [X] posts
- [ ] Video for [Y] posts
- [ ] Newsletter links

## Review Points
- Mid-campaign check: [Date]
- Final review: [Date]
```

## Metrics to Track

### Primary (Weekly)
- Follower growth rate (target: 2-5%/month)
- Avg impressions per post
- Engagement rate (likes + replies + RTs / impressions)
- Newsletter signups from X

### Secondary (Monthly)
- Profile visits
- Link clicks
- Reply rate trend
- Top performing content themes

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these common mistakes:

- **Posting and ghosting** — Must engage in first hour after posting
- **Same content everywhere** — Adapt for platform, don't cross-post verbatim
- **Hashtag stuffing** — Max 1-2, often zero is better
- **Link-only posts** — Always add compelling caption/insight
- **Ignoring replies** — Every reply is an opportunity
- **Inconsistent schedule** — Algorithm favors reliability

## Author Diversity (Algorithm Signal)

The X algorithm penalizes engagement patterns that appear inauthentic or "echo chamber" behavior:

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence | Solution |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Same 5-10 accounts daily | Reduced visibility | Rotate engagement targets weekly |
| Reply bursts | Flagged as spam | Space replies throughout day |
| Generic replies | Lower quality score | Ensure replies add unique value |
| Echo chamber engagement | Limited OON reach | Engage across network clusters |
| Replying to same author repeatedly | Diminished score per interaction | Max 3 replies to same account per day |

**Updated Reply Guy Strategy:**
- Track accounts engaged with (weekly rotation spreadsheet)
- Aim for 50+ quality replies across 30+ unique accounts daily
- Never more than 3 replies to same account per day
- Mix large accounts (50K+) with peers for balanced authority signals
- Rotate niches: data viz → Python → Spanish tech → broader tech

## Out-of-Network (OON) Reach Strategy

Out-of-network content (shown to people who don't follow you) receives different algorithmic scoring. To maximize OON reach:

### High OON Potential Content
1. **Quote Tweets** — Get shown to both your audience and the original author's
2. **Viral-format Content** — High early engagement signals OON distribution
3. **Trending Topic Replies** — Reply to trending conversations for exposure
4. **Premium Status** — 2x OON visibility boost with Premium subscription

### OON Engagement Signals
| Signal | OON Impact |
|--------|------------|
| Reply from large account | Very High |
| Retweet from large account | High |
| Quote tweet engagement | High |
| Trending topic participation | Medium |
| Profile visits from non-followers | Positive signal |

### Campaign Tactic: OON Expansion Week
Dedicate one week per month to OON growth:
- Focus on replying to accounts outside your usual engagement circle
- Create content specifically designed for shareability
- Target trending topics in your niche
- Measure new follower sources

## Troubleshooting

### Shadowban Detection

**Symptoms:**
- Impressions dropped 50%+ suddenly
- No engagement from non-followers
- Replies not appearing in conversations
- Search visibility gone

**Check tools:**
- [Shadowban Test Tool](https://hisubway.online/shadowban/)
- Search your username while logged out

### Recovery Tactics

| Issue | Diagnosis | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Sudden engagement drop | Possible shadowban or algorithm reset | Reduce posting to 1/day, increase engagement, wait 1-2 weeks |
| Gradual decline | Content fatigue or algorithm shift | Experiment with new formats (video, long-form), refresh content pillars |
| Low replies, decent likes | Content not prompting discussion | Add questions, hot takes, controversial (but thoughtful) opinions |
| Low profile visits | Bio not optimized, content not intriguing | Update bio with keywords, improve hooks |
| Shadowban confirmed | Violated guidelines or spam detection | Stop posting 24-48 hours, then gradually resume with quality content only |

### Algorithm Reset Protocol

If you need to "reset" your algorithm relationship:

```
Week 1: Engagement Sprint
- Reduce original posts to 1/day
- 50+ quality replies daily
- Zero promotional content
- Respond to every comment within 30 minutes

Week 2: Quality Over Quantity
- Increase to 2-3 posts/day
- Focus on highest-performing formats
- Continue high engagement
- Track metrics daily

Week 3+: Gradual Return
- Return to normal cadence
- Maintain engagement levels
- Monitor for sustained improvement
```

## Algorithm-Aware KPIs

Track these metrics for campaign health:

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark (Good/Great/Excellent) |
|--------|---------|----------------------------------|
| Reply Rate | Replies / Impressions × 100 | 0.5% / 1% / 2%+ |
| Repost Rate | Reposts / Impressions × 100 | 0.3% / 0.5% / 1%+ |
| Engagement Velocity | Total Engagements / First Hour | Track trend over time |
| OON Reach % | Non-follower impressions / Total impressions | 30% / 50% / 70%+ |
| Follower Growth Rate | New followers / Total followers × 100 | 2% / 5% / 10%+ per month |
