## Foundational Thinking Models

### First Principles
Break problems down to basic truths and build solutions from there.

### Jobs to Be Done
People don't buy products—they "hire" them to get a job done. Focus on the outcome customers want, not features.

### Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)
Roughly 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. Identify and focus on the vital few.

### Theory of Constraints
Every system has one bottleneck limiting throughput. Find and fix that constraint before optimizing elsewhere.

## Understanding Buyers & Human Psychology

### Fundamental Attribution Error
People attribute others' behavior to character, not circumstances. When customers don't convert, examine your process before blaming them.

### Mere Exposure Effect
People prefer things they've seen before. Consistent brand presence builds preference over time.

### Confirmation Bias
People seek information confirming existing beliefs. Understand what your audience already believes and align messaging accordingly.

### Endowment Effect
People value things more once they own them. Free trials let customers "own" the product.

### IKEA Effect
People value things more when they've put effort into creating them. Let customers customize and configure.

### Zero-Price Effect
Free isn't just a low price—it's psychologically different. Free tiers have disproportionate appeal.

### Hyperbolic Discounting
People strongly prefer immediate rewards over future ones. Emphasize immediate benefits.

### Status-Quo Bias
People prefer the current state. Make the transition feel safe and easy.

### Paradox of Choice
Too many options overwhelm and paralyze. Fewer choices often lead to more decisions.

### Goal-Gradient Effect
People accelerate effort as they approach a goal. Show progress bars and completion percentages.

### Peak-End Rule
People judge experiences by the peak and the end. Design memorable peaks and strong endings.

### Zeigarnik Effect
Unfinished tasks occupy the mind. "You're 80% done" creates pull to finish.

## Influencing Behavior & Persuasion

### Reciprocity Principle
People feel obligated to return favors. Give value before asking for anything.

### Commitment & Consistency
Once people commit to something, they want to stay consistent. Get small commitments first.

### Authority Bias
People defer to experts. Feature expert endorsements and credentials.

### Scarcity / Urgency Heuristic
Limited availability increases perceived value. Only use when genuine.

### Loss Aversion
Losses feel twice as painful as equivalent gains. Frame in terms of what they'll lose by not acting.

### Anchoring Effect
The first number heavily influences subsequent judgments. Show higher prices first.

### Decoy Effect
Adding an inferior option makes one of the originals look better.

### Framing Effect
How something is presented changes perception. "90% success rate" vs. "10% failure rate."

### Social Proof / Bandwagon Effect
People follow what others are doing. Show customer counts, testimonials, reviews.

## Pricing Psychology

### Charm Pricing
$99 feels much cheaper than $100. The left digit dominates perception.

### Rounded-Price Effect
Round numbers feel premium. $100 signals quality; $99 signals value.

### Rule of 100
For prices under $100, percentage discounts seem larger. For over $100, absolute discounts seem larger.

### Mental Accounting
"$1/day" feels cheaper than "$30/month."

---

## Design & Delivery Models

### Hick's Law
Decision time increases with options. Simplify choices.

### AIDA Funnel
Attention → Interest → Desire → Action.

### BJ Fogg Behavior Model
Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt. All three must be present.

### EAST Framework
Make desired behaviors: Easy, Attractive, Social, Timely.

### Activation Energy
Reduce starting friction. Make the first step trivially easy.

---

## Growth & Scaling Models

### Feedback Loops
Output becomes input, creating cycles. Build virtuous cycles.

### Compounding
Small, consistent gains accumulate. Benefits accumulate exponentially.

### Network Effects
A product becomes more valuable as more people use it.

### Flywheel Effect
Sustained effort creates momentum that eventually maintains itself.

### Switching Costs
The price of changing to a competitor. Increase switching costs ethically.
