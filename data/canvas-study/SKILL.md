# Canvas Study Strategy

Use Canvas LMS data to create personalized, prioritized study plans.

## Workflow

1. **Gather Data**
   - `canvas_get_upcoming` - All assignments across courses
   - `canvas_get_grades` - Current standing in each course
   - `canvas_list_announcements` - Important course updates

2. **Analyze & Prioritize**
   - Rank by: deadline proximity AND grade weight
   - Flag courses below target grade (typically B+ or 87%)
   - Balance short deadlines with long-term prep

3. **Generate Plan**
   - Break assignments into 2-3 hour study blocks
   - Include buffer time (20% minimum)
   - Mix focused study with practice problems

## Key Principles

- **Verify deadlines**: Check exact times, don't assume midnight
- **Be realistic**: Students have multiple courses; don't overbook
- **Prioritize impact**: Weight + deadline, not just urgency
- **Encourage**: Reduce stress, build confidence

## Fallback

If Canvas data unavailable: provide general study advice and prompt user to connect Canvas in Settings.
