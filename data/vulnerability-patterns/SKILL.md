# Vulnerability Patterns

This skill is an index to modular detection pattern skills. Use the specialized skills for focused scanning.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Finding the right pattern skill** - Use this index to route appropriately
- **Overview of detection capabilities** - Quick reference of what's available

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Actual vulnerability scanning** - Use the specialized skills directly
- **Remediation guidance** - Use remediation-* skills
- **Full security audits** - Use domain auditor agents

---

## Specialized Pattern Skills

### `vuln-patterns-core`
**Covers**: Universal patterns, configuration files, quick scan scripts
**Languages**: All (cross-language patterns)
**Use when**: Scanning any codebase, config audits, hook integration

Includes:
- Hardcoded secrets (API keys, AWS keys, private keys)
- SQL injection (universal patterns)
- Command injection (universal patterns)
- Path traversal
- Configuration file patterns (.env, Docker)
- Quick scan script
- Hook integration guidance

### `vuln-patterns-languages`
**Covers**: Language-specific vulnerability patterns
**Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP
**Use when**: Targeting specific tech stacks, code review

Includes:
- JavaScript: eval(), XSS, prototype pollution
- Python: pickle, yaml.load, weak crypto
- Go: fmt.Sprintf SQL, InsecureSkipVerify
- Java: ObjectInputStream, XXE, createStatement
- Ruby: backticks, Rails SQL, mass assignment
- PHP: unserialize, include, mysql_query
