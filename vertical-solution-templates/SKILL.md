## When to Use
- Localizing GTM assets for specific industries or sub-verticals.
- Preparing ABM/field teams with ready-to-use briefs and demos.
- Coordinating product + marketing on roadmap-aligned solution packages.

## Framework
1. **Template Structure** – executive summary, pain/impact, solution architecture, proof.
2. **Configuration Rules** – recommended modules, integrations, and data sources.
3. **Pricing & Packaging** – typical ACV ranges, value metrics, and contract guardrails.
4. **Evidence Kit** – case studies, references, benchmark stats, and compliance notes.
5. **Activation Plan** – suggested campaigns, field workshops, and demo scripts.

## Templates
- One-pager solution brief (PDF + slide).

- Pricing/ROI worksheet with editable assumptions.

## Tips
- Keep templates modular so teams can mix/match by segment.
- Refresh quarterly with new case studies and roadmap releases.
