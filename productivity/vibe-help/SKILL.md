# vibe-help

The vibe-engineering skill router. Skills are normally picked automatically from their descriptions; this skill is for when the user wants to browse, or isn't sure which one fits.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks "what skill should I use?", "help", or "what can vibe-engineering do?"
- User is starting an unfamiliar type of task and wants a recommended workflow
- You are unsure which of two similar skills applies

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- A specific skill was already invoked, or obviously applies
- In the middle of executing another skill's workflow
- Trivially simple tasks (e.g., "fix this typo")

## How to Route

Ask what the user is trying to do (unless it's already clear), then recommend **one** starting skill and at most two follow-ups. Don't recite the whole catalog unless asked.

### "I'm about to build something new"
→ Before: `vibe-research-before-design`, then `vibe-requirements-validator` if there's a PRD
→ During: `vibe-scope-guard`, `vibe-production-mindset` (production code)
→ After: `vibe-quality-loop`, `vibe-acceptance-gate`

### "I need to fix bugs / issues"
→ 1–5 bugs: fix directly, then `vibe-reflect-and-compound` for any non-trivial one
→ Intermittent / "flaky" failure: `vibe-flake-root-cause`
→ 10+ bugs or findings: `vibe-gap-closure-loop`
→ Prevent recurrence: `vibe-adversarial-test-generation`

### "I'm reviewing code, a design, or docs"
→ Design or large change: `vibe-devil-advocate-review` (panel mode for multi-agent release candidates)
→ Spec compliance: `vibe-spec-sync --audit`
→ Docs: `vibe-doc-quality-gate` · Requirements: `vibe-requirements-validator`

### "I need to test something"
→ Planning: `vibe-scenario-matrix` · Coverage: `vibe-coverage-enforcer`
→ Edge cases: `vibe-adversarial-test-generation` · Parsers: `vibe-fuzz-parser-inputs`
→ Snapshots: `vibe-golden-file-testing` · Concurrency: `vibe-concurrent-test-safety`

### "I'm committing, deploying, or shipping"
→ Commit: `vibe-pre-commit-audit`, `vibe-spec-sync`
→ Deploy: `vibe-safe-deploy` · Risky change: `vibe-rollback-plan`
→ Publishing drafted or privately sourced content: `vibe-publication-leak-guard`
→ Running services: `vibe-service-health-dashboard`

### "I have a lot of parallel work"
→ One-shot fan-out: `vibe-parallel-task-decomposition` → Integrate: `vibe-cherry-pick-integration`
→ Multi-phase project with long-lived agents: `vibe-workstream-orchestration`

### "Is this production-ready?"
→ Audit: `vibe-gap-analysis` → Close gaps: `vibe-gap-closure-loop`

### "I need to make or record a decision"
→ Research: `vibe-research-before-design` → Record: `vibe-decision-journal` → Challenge: `vibe-devil-advocate-review`

### "I want to capture what just happened"
→ Learnings, bugs, patterns: `vibe-reflect-and-compound`
→ Handing off, or winding down at a usage limit: `vibe-handover-doc`
→ End of sprint: `vibe-iteration-review`

### "Am I actually done?"
→ `vibe-acceptance-gate`, then `vibe-anti-rationalization-check`
