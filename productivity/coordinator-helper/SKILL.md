# Coordinator Helper

Manage the coordinator daemon for autonomous task delegation, approval workflows, and monitoring agent work.

## Quick Start

**Most common usage:**
```bash
# User says: "Delegate this bug fix to an agent"
# This skill will:
# 1. Check if coordinator daemon is running
# 2. Send the task via ailang messages
# 3. Monitor the task status
# 4. Guide you through approval when complete

# User says: "What tasks are pending?"
# This skill will:
# 1. Run ailang coordinator list --pending
# 2. Show interactive task explorer
# 3. Let you review diffs, logs, and approve/reject
```

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- User asks to "delegate a task" or "send to coordinator"
- User wants to "check task status" or "see what's running"
- User asks to "review agent work" or "approve/reject tasks"
- User says "start the coordinator" or "stop the daemon"
- User wants to "clean up worktrees" or manage coordinator state

## Available Scripts

### `scripts/check_daemon.sh`
Check if the coordinator daemon is running and show status.

### `scripts/delegate_task.sh <type> <title> <description>`
Send a task to the coordinator for autonomous execution.

### `scripts/quick_status.sh`
Show a quick summary of pending, running, and completed tasks.

## Core Commands

### Starting/Stopping the Daemon

```bash
# Start coordinator + server (recommended)
make services-start

# Or just coordinator
ailang coordinator start

# Check status
ailang coordinator status

# Stop all
make services-stop
```

### Delegating Tasks

```bash
# Send a task
ailang messages send coordinator "Fix the null pointer bug in parser.go" \
  --title "Bug: Parser NPE" --from "claude-code" --type bug
```

### Monitoring & Approving

```bash
# Interactive task list
ailang coordinator list

# Filter by status
ailang coordinator list --pending
ailang coordinator list --running

# Approve from list: select task, press [a]
# Or directly: ailang coordinator approve <task-id>
```

## Task Lifecycle

```
pending → queued → running → pending_approval → completed
                          ↘ failed / rejected
```

## GitHub-Driven Workflow (v0.6.2+)

For tasks linked to GitHub issues, the coordinator supports a fully GitHub-native approval workflow.

### How It Works

```
GitHub Issue
    ↓ (import)
DESIGN STAGE → posts design doc to GitHub → needs-design-approval label
    ↓ (human adds: design-approved)
SPRINT STAGE → posts sprint plan to GitHub → needs-sprint-approval label
    ↓ (human adds: sprint-approved)
IMPLEMENTATION → posts file changes → needs-merge-approval label
    ↓ (human adds: merge-approved)
Changes merged, issue auto-closed
```

### GitHub Labels Reference

| You Add This Label | What Happens |
|--------------------|--------------|
| `design-approved` | Advances to sprint planning |
| `sprint-approved` | Advances to implementation |
| `merge-approved` | Merges changes, closes issue |
| `needs-revision` | Pauses pipeline for changes |

### Quick Commands for GitHub Workflow

```bash
# Import GitHub issues as tasks
ailang messages import-github

# Check which issues are being watched
tail -100 ~/.ailang/logs/coordinator.log | grep -i "watching issue"

# Fallback: approve locally if labels aren't detected
ailang coordinator approve <task-id>

# Check pending approvals
ailang coordinator pending
```

### Why Use GitHub Workflow?

- **Review in GitHub UI** - See design docs and diffs alongside issue discussion
- **Mobile-friendly** - Approve from GitHub mobile app
- **Team collaboration** - Multiple reviewers can discuss in comments
- **Audit trail** - All approvals tracked in issue history

## Workflow

### 1. Delegate a Task

1. **Describe clearly** - Be specific about what needs to be done
2. **Choose type** - bug, feature, docs, research, refactor, test
3. **Send message** - `ailang messages send coordinator "..." --type bug`

### 2. Review Completed Work

1. **Open explorer** - `ailang coordinator list`
2. **Select task** - Enter task number
3. **Review**:
   - `[d]` View diff
   - `[f]` Browse files
   - `[l]` View logs
4. **Decide** - `[a]` Approve or `[r]` Reject

### 3. Task Routing

| Type | Executor | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| bug-fix | Claude Code | Code fixes |
| feature | Claude Code | New functionality |
| docs | Gemini | Documentation |
| research | Gemini | Investigation |

## Troubleshooting

**Daemon won't start:** Check `ailang coordinator status`, then `make services-stop && make services-start`

**Task stuck:** View logs with `[l]` in task explorer

**Worktree limit:** `git worktree list` then `git worktree remove <path> --force`

**GitHub labels not detected:** The ApprovalWatcher may not be detecting labels. Use CLI fallback:
```bash
ailang coordinator pending    # List tasks waiting for approval
ailang coordinator approve <task-id>   # Approve locally (syncs label to GitHub)
```

**No logs from ApprovalWatcher:** Check coordinator logs for "GitHub approval watcher started". If missing, verify `~/.ailang/config.yaml` has `github_sync.enabled: true`.

## Resources

See [resources/reference.md](resources/reference.md) for complete CLI reference and advanced options.

## Notes

- Coordinator uses isolated git worktrees per task
- Worktrees auto-cleanup after approval
- Events stream to dashboard at http://localhost:1957
- State stored in `~/.ailang/state/coordinator.db`
