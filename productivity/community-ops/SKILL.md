# Community Operations Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- Standing up new community channels, automation, or tooling.
- Coordinating moderator schedules, onboarding flows, and partner access.
- Auditing operations for consistency, compliance, or scale.

## Framework
1. **Channel Setup** – naming conventions, permissions, integrations, and backup owners.
2. **Workflow Automation** – welcome flows, tagging, escalation triggers, and reporting pipelines.
3. **Resource Management** – moderator rosters, ambassador kits, and knowledge base updates.
4. **Compliance & Security** – access reviews, data retention, legal approvals, and crisis playbooks.
5. **Continuous Improvement** – retros, tooling evaluations, and experiment backlog.

## Templates
- Channel launch checklist (config, automation, QA, analytics hooks).
- Moderator shift planner with coverage heatmap.
- Automation registry (flow, trigger, owner, status, notes).

## Tips
- Keep SOPs in a shared workspace with version history.
- Pair with `escalation` skill to ensure automation ties into incident paths.
- Review automation logs weekly to catch failures before members notice.
