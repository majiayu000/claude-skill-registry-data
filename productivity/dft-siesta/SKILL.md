description: Route SIESTA requests to task-specific subskills based on user intent. Use when the user asks for SIESTA workflows and you must decide between static, relaxation, molecular dynamics, or electronic-analysis preparation. This orchestration skill dispatches to the correct SIESTA subskill and enforces consistent handoff to submission skills.
compatibility: Requires a runnable SIESTA environment and compatible pseudopotential/basis setup for target elements.

# SIESTA Task Router

Use this skill as the **top-level SIESTA orchestration layer**.

## Purpose

This skill routes requests to one task-specific SIESTA subskill path:

- `dft-siesta/static`
- `dft-siesta/relax`
- `dft-siesta/md`
- `dft-siesta/electronic`

## Scope

This router skill should:

- require user-provided structure or prerequisite context
- classify request intent into one SIESTA task type
- collect minimal shared context before dispatch
- delegate detailed parameter handling to selected subskill
- enforce consistent output/handoff policy across subskills

This router skill should **not**:

- own detailed templates for all SIESTA tasks
- execute or submit calculations
- bypass subskill-specific guardrails

## Hard requirement

The user must provide enough starting context:

- structure input for `static` / `relax` / `md`
- prerequisite converged context for `electronic`

If prerequisites are missing, stop and ask for them.

## Routing rules

1. If user requests single-point SCF/energy: route to `dft-siesta/static`.
1. If user requests geometry optimization: route to `dft-siesta/relax`.
1. If user requests molecular dynamics: route to `dft-siesta/md`.
1. If user requests electronic analysis workflow: route to `dft-siesta/electronic`.
1. If intent is ambiguous, ask one focused clarification question before routing.

## Shared policy for all subskills

- do not invent missing pseudopotential files
- expose assumptions and unresolved scientific choices explicitly
- return handoff-ready task layout
- if execution is requested, hand off to `dpdisp-submit`

## Output from router

Provide:

1. selected subskill path
1. why it was selected
1. minimal missing inputs (if any)
1. explicit next step (invoke selected subskill)
