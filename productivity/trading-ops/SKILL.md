# Trading ops (agent skill)

This skill teaches an agent how to **operate** this repository safely. It is not a profit claim.

Repo: paper-first SPY options validation. Active family: **`spy_put_credit`**. Iron condor **new entries killed**.

## Safety gates (hard)

Before any action that could submit orders or close positions:

1. Read `data/runtime/strategy_kill_switch.json` — confirm `active_family` and `live_blocked`.
2. Prefer **paper** paths only. Live is blocked until kill criteria clear.
3. **Do not** freehand-close positions outside `spy_put_credit.py` or `residual_ic_manager.py`.
4. **Do not** remove `data/TRADING_HALTED` / halt flags to “unblock” trading.
5. **Do not** recreate iron-condor entry workflows; they must remain absent.
6. Never hardcode Alpaca keys; use `get_alpaca_credentials()`.

If a tool or hook refuses a boundary action, treat that as signal — find the allowed path or stop.

Unmatched fills are **not** trades. Do not promote them into win rate / expectancy.

## Continuous arXiv research ingest

Twice-daily GitHub Action (`arxiv-paper-ingestion.yml`) pulls new papers from
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org) (API: `export.arxiv.org`) into `rag_knowledge/arxiv/`
and rebuilds `data/rag/lessons_query.json`. Local:

```bash
make arxiv-ingest
python scripts/arxiv_paper_ingestion.py --query "option credit spread" --json
```

Papers are **research context only** — never treat them as live signals or edge proof.

## Judge panel (claim / PR / coord audit — not trade entry)

Mixture-of-Experts + hard-veto judge for **agent claims**, PR text/diffs, and multi-agent collisions.

```bash
python scripts/judge_panel.py --self-check
python scripts/judge_panel.py --kind claim_audit --text "CI green on run <id> sha <sha>"
python scripts/judge_panel.py --kind pr_audit --diff-file /tmp/patch.diff
python scripts/judge_panel.py --kind coord_audit --agent grok \
  --other-claims-file ~/Documents/AI-Agent-Sync/Agent-State/codex.md \
  --claimed-file src/evals/judge_panel/panel.py
```

- Code: `src/evals/judge_panel/`
- **Never** use this panel to approve put-credit or IC entries (`trade_entry` always vetoes).
- Edge / “ready for live” claims without ledger or run evidence → fail/veto.

## Status commands (read-only first)

```bash
python scripts/spy_put_credit.py --status
python scripts/audit_open_inventory.py
python scripts/system_health_check.py
# optional refresh (mutates local state files; does not open risk by itself)
python scripts/sync_alpaca_state.py
python scripts/sync_closed_positions.py
# Graph RAG (relationships across kill switch, lessons, paired trades)
python scripts/graph_rag_query.py --rebuild
python scripts/graph_rag_query.py --query "why is iron condor killed?" --graph-only
# Hard gate: rebuild + 5 golden multi-hop assertions (CI offline-evals + make check)
python scripts/verify_graph_rag.py
make graph-rag-check
# Official Graphify-Labs/graphify (package graphifyy; graph.json query/path/explain)
python scripts/graphify_ops.py status --json
python scripts/graphify_ops.py query "what calls TradeGateway"
make graphify-check
# zg-style local-first search (hybrid|fts|vector|rg) — docs/ZG_LOCAL_SEARCH.md
python scripts/zg_search.py --check-ready
python scripts/zg_search.py "put credit stop loss"
python scripts/zg_search.py --route rg "TradeGateway"
# JIT task→harness pack (memory/plan/actions/skills) — docs/JIT_HARNESS.md
python scripts/jit_harness.py --check-ready
python scripts/jit_harness.py "account status"
python scripts/jit_harness.py --json "put credit dry-run"
python scripts/jit_harness.py --receipt "spy_put_credit --status --dry-run"
python scripts/jit_harness.py --receipt --record "merge ready PRs"
```

Inventory unclean (`exit 2`) → **no new risk**.

## Plan vs execute

```bash
# plan only — no submit
python scripts/spy_put_credit.py --dry-run

# residual IC plan only (not new IC entries)
python scripts/residual_ic_manager.py --dry-run
```

Never describe a dry-run plan as an executed trade.

Completed paper work is a **broker-filled** 1-lot put-credit (`credit_source=broker_fill`).
`--execute-paper` JSON `success: true` without `fill_confirmed` is not a fill (AGENT-610 / Astra FORMAT, not GPT-6).

```bash
python scripts/work_within_reach.py --from-journal --json
python scripts/work_within_reach.py --from-journal --execute-rc 0 --json
```

## Evidence rules

- Equity / P/L / win rate: cite `data/system_state.json` or `data/trades.json` with numbers.
- 0 put-credit closed trades in cohort → no profitability claim.
- Prefer `RETRIEVE → CITE → SPEAK`.

## Git / change protocol

- Feature work in a dedicated `git worktree` under `.worktrees/`.
- PRs for all changes; merge only with green CI evidence.
- No force-push to `main`.
- After substantive ops work, record lessons in `rag_knowledge/lessons_learned/` when severity ≥ 4 or a repeat mistake occurred.

## Tests

```bash
make check
make dry-run
```

## What this skill is not

- Not permission to deploy live capital.
- Not a substitute for broker truth.
- Not a claim that put-credit has edge before n≥30 cohort gates pass.
