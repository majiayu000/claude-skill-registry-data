# Reflect

Consolidate the current session's work into the recall history.

## Workflow

1.  **Read Context**:
    Read `.fleet/context/recall/current.md` to see what happened this session.

2.  **Summarize**:
    Create a brief summary of:
    - Tasks completed
    - Key decisions made
    - Open issues

3.  **Archive**:
    Append this summary to `.fleet/context/recall/history.md` (or creating a dated file in `recall/sessions/`).

4.  **Clear Scratchpad**:
    Reset `.fleet/context/recall/current.md` for the next task.
