# Agentic IDE

Use this skill to manage codebase changes with context-aware tooling.

## Workflow

1) Scan repo for targets (TODOs, hotspots, refactor candidates).
2) Build a scoped change plan and identify impacted files.
3) Apply edits with tests or validation steps.
4) Summarize changes and link to diffs.

## Output expectations

- Provide a scoped plan and explicit file list.
- Call out tests or checks to run.
