# Strategic Analysis - Strategy Evaluator

Assess strategic positioning, competitive dynamics, and explore alternative futures. Move from gut feeling to structured strategic thinking.

## Quick Start

1. Identify what strategic question you're trying to answer
2. Select technique based on what kind of analysis you need
3. Work through the framework systematically

## Technique Selection

| Need | Use | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Assess current strategic position | SWOT Analysis | Balanced view of internal/external factors |
| Understand competitive dynamics | Porter's Five Forces | Maps industry pressure points |
| Explore possible futures | Scenario Planning | Prepares for multiple outcomes |
| Test assumptions quickly | What-If Analysis | Rapid exploration of variables |

**Default**: Use SWOT for current state assessment, Scenario Planning for future uncertainty.

## Techniques

### SWOT Analysis
Structured assessment of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Internal vs external, positive vs negative.

### Porter's Five Forces
Analyze competitive intensity through five structural forces: rivalry, suppliers, buyers, substitutes, new entrants.

### Scenario Planning
Develop multiple plausible futures and strategies that work across them. Prepare for uncertainty.

### What-If Analysis
Rapidly explore how changes to key variables would affect outcomes. Test sensitivity and assumptions.

## Core Principles

1. **Data over opinion** - Ground analysis in evidence where possible
2. **Multiple perspectives** - One framework rarely captures everything
3. **So what?** - Always connect analysis to actionable implications
4. **Challenge assumptions** - The most dangerous assumptions are unstated ones
5. **Revisit regularly** - Strategic landscape changes; analysis should too

## When Strategic Analysis Works Best

- Major decisions with long-term consequences
- Entering new markets or launching new products
- Competitive landscape is shifting
- Need to align stakeholders on strategic direction
- Annual planning and strategy reviews

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating SWOT as a checklist, not a thinking tool
- Analyzing in isolation (one framework, no synthesis)
- Confusing current state with desired state
- Over-confidence in single scenarios
- Analysis paralysis - never moving to action
