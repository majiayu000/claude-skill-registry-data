## Purpose

Focus, Timeboxing, and 80/20 provides structured techniques for managing attention, prioritizing high-impact work, and using time constraints to overcome procrastination and context-switching. This skill guides you through identifying your vital few tasks (80/20), designing focus blocks, timeboxing work, and managing energy to maximize deep work output.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- **Overwhelmed by tasks**: Too many things competing for attention, unsure where to focus
- **Procrastination**: Important work gets delayed, easier tasks feel more urgent
- **Context-switching**: Constantly interrupted, can't get into flow state
- **Productivity planning**: Designing daily/weekly schedules, allocating time to priorities
- **Deep work needed**: Complex thinking, writing, coding, design requiring sustained focus
- **Energy management**: Feeling burned out, working long hours with low output
- **80/20 analysis**: Identifying which 20% of efforts drive 80% of results
- **Meeting overload**: Calendar packed, no time for focused work
- **Task batching**: Grouping similar tasks (emails, calls, admin) for efficiency
- **Deadline pressure**: Using time constraints productively (Parkinson's Law)

Trigger phrases: "timeboxing", "Pomodoro", "deep work", "80/20 rule", "Pareto principle", "focus blocks", "task batching", "energy management", "time management", "procrastination", "productivity system"

## What Is It?

**Focus, Timeboxing, and 80/20** combines three complementary techniques for managing attention and priorities:

**Core components**:
- **80/20 Principle (Pareto)**: 20% of inputs drive 80% of outputs. Identify vital few tasks with disproportionate impact.
- **Timeboxing**: Allocate fixed time periods to tasks. Work expands to fill time (Parkinson's Law), so constrain it.
- **Deep Work**: Sustained, distraction-free focus on cognitively demanding tasks (Cal Newport). Produces high-value output.
- **Energy Management**: Match task intensity to energy levels. Protect peak hours for most important work.
- **Batching**: Group similar low-focus tasks (email, admin, calls) to minimize context-switching.

**Quick example:**

**Scenario**: Software engineer overwhelmed with tickets, meetings, code reviews, and a complex feature to build.

**80/20 Analysis**:
- **20% (High Impact)**: Ship new payment feature (biggest customer request, revenue impact)
- **80% (Lower Impact)**: Bug fixes, refactoring, minor tickets, meetings

**Timeboxed Weekly Plan**:
- **Mon-Wed mornings (9-12am)**: Deep work on payment feature (3hr blocks, no meetings, Slack off)
- **Mon-Wed afternoons (2-4pm)**: Code reviews, standups, pair programming
- **Thu-Fri**: Batch meetings, planning, admin, lower-priority tickets

**Daily Timeboxing** (Monday):
- 9:00-10:30am: Payment feature - API design (90 min deep work)
- 10:30-10:45am: Break, walk outside
- 10:45-12:15pm: Payment feature - Implementation (90 min deep work)
- 12:15-1:00pm: Lunch
- 2:00-3:00pm: Batch code reviews (5 PRs, 12 min each)
- 3:00-3:30pm: Standup + team sync
- 3:30-4:00pm: Emails, Slack, admin
- 4:00pm: Hard stop, no evening work

**Outcome**: Payment feature shipped in 3 days (18 hours deep work) vs. estimated 2+ weeks with constant interruptions. 80/20 focus + timeboxing unlocked 4× productivity.

**Core benefits**:
- **Parkinson's Law harnessed**: Time constraints force decisions, prevent perfectionism
- **Context-switching eliminated**: Batching and focus blocks preserve flow state
- **Guilt-free focus**: Pre-allocated time for deep work and admin reduces anxiety
- **Energy optimization**: High-impact work during peak hours, admin during low energy
- **Measurable progress**: Timeboxes create accountability and completion satisfaction

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Focus & Timeboxing Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Identify your 80/20
- [ ] Step 2: Design focus blocks
- [ ] Step 3: Timebox your week
- [ ] Step 4: Timebox your day
- [ ] Step 5: Execute with discipline
- [ ] Step 6: Review and adjust
```

**Step 1: Identify your 80/20**

What 20% of tasks drive 80% of your results? Separate vital few from trivial many. See [resources/template.md](resources/template.md#8020-analysis-template).

**Step 2: Design focus blocks**

Block time for deep work on high-impact tasks. Match duration to task type (Pomodoro 25min, Deep Work 90-120min). See [resources/template.md](resources/template.md#focus-block-design-template) and [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md#1-deep-work-and-focus-blocks).

**Step 3: Timebox your week**

Allocate weekly calendar: deep work blocks, meeting blocks, batched admin, buffer time. See [resources/template.md](resources/template.md#weekly-timeboxing-template) and [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md#2-timeboxing-techniques).

**Step 4: Timebox your day**

Break day into time-constrained blocks with start/end times. Schedule breaks. Plan evening hard stop. See [resources/template.md](resources/template.md#daily-timeboxing-template).

**Step 5: Execute with discipline**

Honor timeboxes. Use timers. Eliminate distractions (Slack off, phone away, close tabs). Take breaks. See [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md#3-execution-discipline).

**Step 6: Review and adjust**

Weekly review: Did you protect deep work? What interrupted focus? Adjust schedule. See [resources/template.md](resources/template.md#weekly-review-template) and [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md#4-energy-management-and-optimization).

## Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Pomodoro Technique (25 min focus)**
- **Format**: 25 min focused work + 5 min break, repeat 4×, then 15-30 min break
- **Best for**: Tasks with high resistance (procrastination), need for frequent breaks, building focus habit
- **Tools**: Timer, task list, distraction blockers
- **When**: Short tasks, starting new habits, high-distraction environments
- **Guardrails**: Don't interrupt Pomodoro mid-session, actually take breaks (don't skip)

**Pattern 2: Deep Work Blocks (90-120 min)**
- **Format**: 90-120 min uninterrupted focus on single cognitively demanding task
- **Best for**: Complex thinking (writing, coding, design, strategy), high-value creative work
- **Preparation**: Clear goal for session, all resources ready, distractions eliminated
- **When**: Peak energy hours (usually morning), maximum 2-3 blocks per day
- **Guardrails**: No meetings during deep work, Slack/email off, phone in another room

**Pattern 3: Weekly 80/20 Planning**
- **Format**: Sunday/Monday - identify top 3 high-impact goals for week, schedule deep work blocks
- **Best for**: Strategic prioritization, ensuring vital few get attention
- **Output**: 3-5 focus blocks (90-120 min each) on calendar for week's top priorities
- **When**: Start of week, quarterly planning, project kickoffs
- **Guardrails**: Protect these blocks ruthlessly, treat like unmovable meetings

**Pattern 4: Task Batching (30-60 min blocks)**
- **Format**: Group similar low-cognitive-load tasks (emails, calls, admin) into single session
- **Best for**: Reducing context-switching, clearing small tasks efficiently
- **Examples**: Email batches (11am, 4pm), meeting blocks (Tue/Thu afternoons), admin Fridays
- **When**: Low-energy periods, after deep work, end of day
- **Guardrails**: Set timer, don't let batches expand, resist checking email outside batches

**Pattern 5: Maker's Schedule (Half-day or Full-day blocks)**
- **Format**: Uninterrupted half-days (4+ hours) or full days for creative/technical work
- **Best for**: Large projects (research paper, product launch, complex feature), flow-state work
- **Preparation**: Clear all meetings for that period, OOO on Slack, backup plan if interrupted
- **When**: Critical deadlines, breakthrough work needed, once/week minimum for makers
- **Guardrails**: Communicate boundaries, delegate urgent issues, plan breaks within block

**Pattern 6: Energy-Based Scheduling**
- **Format**: Match task type to energy level (peak → deep work, trough → admin, recovery → meetings)
- **Best for**: Maximizing output while preventing burnout
- **Typical cycle**: Peak (9am-12pm) → Trough (2-3pm) → Recovery (4-5pm)
- **When**: Designing weekly/daily schedules, recovering from overwork
- **Guardrails**: Track your actual energy patterns (not generic), honor low-energy periods with rest

## Guardrails

**Critical requirements:**

1. **Protect deep work time**: No meetings, no Slack, no email during focus blocks. Treat as sacred. One interruption destroys 20+ min of flow. Schedule deep work during peak energy (usually mornings).

2. **Respect Parkinson's Law**: Work expands to fill available time. Shorter timeboxes force prioritization and prevent perfectionism. Better: 90 min timebox with clear outcome than open-ended "work on this."

3. **Actually identify 80/20**: Most people work on 80% (low-impact). Force rank tasks by impact. Top 20% should get 80% of your focus time. Cut, delegate, or batch the rest.

4. **Energy > Time**: 8 hours tired < 4 hours energized. Don't schedule deep work during low-energy troughs. Match intensity to energy. Trough = admin/meetings, not complex thinking.

5. **Build in buffer**: Don't timebox every minute. 20% unscheduled time for unexpected issues, overflow, breaks. Over-scheduled = fragile. One delay cascades.

6. **Hard stops prevent burnout**: Define end-of-day (e.g., 5pm hard stop). No evening work unless true emergency. Constrained time forces prioritization, endless time enables procrastination.

7. **Breaks are non-negotiable**: 90 min deep work → 10-15 min break. Walk, stretch, look outside. Don't skip breaks to "power through." Focus degrades exponentially after 90-120 min.

8. **Measure focus quality, not hours**: 3 hours deep work > 8 hours distracted. Track how many focus blocks completed per week, not total hours. Quality over quantity.

**Common pitfalls:**

- ❌ **No real deep work blocks**: Calendar full of meetings, "focus time" constantly interrupted. Protect minimum 2-3× 90-min blocks per week.
- ❌ **Ignoring 80/20**: Everything feels important. Force rank. If you can't identify top 20%, ask: "If I could only work 10 hours this week, what would I do?"
- ❌ **Timeboxing trivia**: Scheduling every email, every Slack message. Batch low-value tasks, don't timebox them individually.
- ❌ **Skipping breaks**: "I'll break after I finish this." Then work 4 hours straight, output quality tanks. Use timer, force breaks.
- ❌ **Peak hours on admin**: Checking email at 9am (peak energy). Save admin for afternoon trough. Peak hours = deep work only.
- ❌ **Overcommitting**: Timeboxing 10 hours of work into 8-hour day. Be realistic. Under-schedule, over-deliver.

## Quick Reference

**Timeboxing durations:**

| Duration | Best For | Rest After |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **25 min** | Pomodoro, high-resistance tasks, building habit | 5 min |
| **50 min** | Focused work, moderate complexity | 10 min |
| **90 min** | Deep work, complex thinking, creative tasks | 15 min |
| **120 min** | Maximum deep work (rare, high expertise) | 20-30 min |
| **Half-day (4h)** | Maker's schedule, breakthroughs, flow state | Lunch + afternoon off |

**Energy-based scheduling:**

| Time | Energy Level | Task Type | Examples |
|------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **6-9am** | Peak (early risers) | Deep work | Writing, coding, strategy |
| **9am-12pm** | Peak (most people) | Deep work | Complex problems, creative work |
| **12-2pm** | Lunch dip | Meetings, social | Standups, 1:1s, collaboration |
| **2-3pm** | Trough | Admin, batching | Email, Slack, expense reports |
| **3-5pm** | Recovery | Moderate work | Code reviews, planning, lighter tasks |
| **Evening** | Low | Rest or routine | Reading, exercise, NOT deep work |

**80/20 identification:**

Ask these questions:
- "If I could only work 10 hours this week, what would I do?"
- "Which tasks, if done well, make everything else easier or unnecessary?"
- "What creates 10× value vs. 1× value?"
- "What will matter in 6 months? What won't?"

**Focus blockers (eliminate during deep work):**

- [ ] Slack/Teams (quit app or set DND)
- [ ] Email (close tab/app)
- [ ] Phone (different room, airplane mode)
- [ ] Browser tabs (close all except work-related)
- [ ] Open floor plans (noise-canceling headphones, office door)
- [ ] Notifications (disable all)
- [ ] Meetings (schedule-free mornings)

**Batching categories:**

- **Email batches**: 11am, 4pm (2× per day max)
- **Meeting blocks**: Tue/Thu afternoons
- **Admin batch**: Friday afternoons (expense reports, timesheets, planning)
- **Code review batch**: After lunch (30-60 min)
- **Quick calls batch**: 30-min slots back-to-back

**Weekly planning template** (simplified):

```
Monday-Wednesday mornings: Deep work on Priority 1 (3× 90-min blocks)
Monday-Wednesday afternoons: Meetings, collaboration, moderate work
Thursday: Deep work on Priority 2 (morning), meetings (afternoon)
Friday: Batched admin, planning next week, code reviews
```

**Inputs required:**
- **Current commitments**: Meetings, recurring tasks, deadlines
- **Energy patterns**: When are you most/least energized? (track for 1 week)
- **Top priorities**: What are your 3-5 most important outcomes this week/month?
- **Task list**: Everything competing for attention (to identify 80/20)
