name: rebase
description: Start a local Git rebase when the user explicitly requests replay of a named source ref, or of the current branch, onto a named target, including a rebase-then-push request, which carries exact-lease publication to the branch's own remote destination, or continue or abort an active rebase. Use only when local history replay will start or is active; do not use for merge-based branch updates, repository merge settings, pull-request or merge-request merging, or push-only requests.

## Result-bound verification

For start/continue completion, bind validation to the immutable result commit `R`.
Run repository-required and changed-interaction checks on a clean detached worktree
or equivalent isolated checkout of `R`, separately from restored user changes.
Preserve unrelated work; a passing dirty worktree does not validate its commit.
Record the checked OID and environment; verify checks left tracked source unchanged.
Source-mutating checks invalidate that evidence. Commit a required correction within
the existing task authority, then rebind `R` and rerun its checks. When that commit
is blocked or unauthorized, pause rather than reporting the correction published.
Every result change, including remote reconciliation, invalidates earlier result
validation. Reobserve the named result ref before completion; it must still name
`R`. A decision or stopped-state path cannot become a success merely because its
refs or ancestry still satisfy the goal.

## Publication authority

A start request to rebase a branch authorizes publishing `R` to that branch's own remote
destination, using `--force-with-lease` bound to an observed destination OID. Local-only
wording in the request withdraws it. Continue publishes only under authority bound at
start; abort never publishes. Any other destination, any lease not bound to an
observed OID, and any other force-push needs explicit authority.

Other parties update remote feature branches. Fetch the destination before replay and
again before pushing; integrate what it gained, then continue
([publication](./references/publication.md)).
