# Interview Me

Structured intent extraction before specs, plans, or code. Complements `clarify-underspecified` with a stricter one-question cadence and explicit stop conditions.

## When to use

- User has a goal but not a spec
- Multiple interpretations exist and batch questions would overwhelm
- Before `spec-driven-development` or `planning-and-task-breakdown`

## When not to use

- User already provided a complete spec or ticket
- Single factual question suffices
- Emergency fix with clear repro steps

## Workflow

1. **State purpose** — one sentence on what you are extracting (goal, constraints, success criteria).
2. **Ask one question** — highest-leverage unknown only; offer 2–4 concrete options when helpful.
3. **Listen and summarize** — after each answer, one-line recap of what you learned.
4. **Stop when** — you can write: objective, non-goals, constraints, acceptance criteria, and open risks.
5. **Hand off** — produce a short intent brief or propose `spec-driven-development`.

## Rules

- Never ask more than one question per turn unless user explicitly requests a batch.
- Prefer multiple-choice or examples over open-ended vagueness.
- Do not start implementation until stop condition is met or user waives interview.
- Flag assumptions explicitly; do not silently fill gaps.
- If user jumps to implementation, pause and confirm intent or non-goals in one question.
