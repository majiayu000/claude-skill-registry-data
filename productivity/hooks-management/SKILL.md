# Hooks Management

Manage hooks and automation through natural language commands.

**IMPORTANT**: After adding, modifying, or removing hooks, always inform the user that they need to **restart the agent** for changes to take effect. Hooks are loaded at startup.

## Quick Reference

**Hook Events** (Claude Code, as of 2026-04 — 28 events):

- *Session lifecycle*: SessionStart, SessionEnd, InstructionsLoaded
- *User input*: UserPromptSubmit, UserPromptExpansion
- *Tool execution*: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PostToolUseFailure, PostToolBatch
- *Permissions*: PermissionRequest, PermissionDenied
- *Model output*: Stop, StopFailure
- *Subagents/tasks*: SubagentStart, SubagentStop, TaskCreated, TaskCompleted, TeammateIdle
- *Config/state*: ConfigChange, FileChanged, CwdChanged
- *Compaction*: PreCompact, PostCompact
- *Worktree*: WorktreeCreate, WorktreeRemove
- *MCP*: Elicitation, ElicitationResult
- *Notifications*: Notification

**Handler types**: `command`, `http`, `mcp_tool`, `prompt`, `agent`. Some events are command-only (PostCompact, PermissionDenied, Elicitation/ElicitationResult, FileChanged, CwdChanged, ConfigChange, InstructionsLoaded, WorktreeCreate/Remove, SubagentStart, StopFailure, TeammateIdle, Setup, SessionStart, SessionEnd, Notification).

**Claude Code Settings Files**:
- User-wide: `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Project: `.claude/settings.json`
- Local (not committed): `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Drop-in policy fragments: `~/.claude/managed-settings.d/` (managed-settings only)

**Codex CLI / Codex App Settings Files (current as of 2026-06)**:
- User config: `~/.codex/config.toml`
- User hooks: `~/.codex/hooks.json` or inline `[hooks]` tables in `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Project hooks: `<repo>/.codex/hooks.json` or inline `[hooks]` tables in `<repo>/.codex/config.toml` (trusted projects only)
- Codex App and CLI share these config layers. In the App/IDE, the settings UI opens the same `config.toml`.
- Hooks are enabled by default. Use `[features].hooks = false` to disable them. `codex_hooks` is a deprecated alias.
- Non-managed Codex command hooks must be reviewed/trusted with `/hooks`; changed hook definitions are skipped until trusted.

**Devin CLI / Desktop hook locations**:
- Project: `.devin/hooks.v1.json` (standalone hooks object, recommended) or `"hooks"` in `.devin/config.json` / `.devin/config.local.json`
- User: `"hooks"` in `~/.config/devin/config.json` (`%APPDATA%\devin\config.json` on Windows)
- Claude-format hooks under `.claude/` are imported automatically when `read_config_from.claude` is on (default)
- Events: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PermissionRequest, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, PostCompaction, SessionStart, SessionEnd; `matcher` is a regex on `tool_name`
- See [references/devin-hooks.md](references/devin-hooks.md) for the full event/output contract

**Claude Code default control mechanism for PreToolUse**: emit JSON on stdout with `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` set to `"allow"`, `"deny"`, **`"ask"`** (triggers the built-in user confirmation prompt), or **`"defer"`** (pause headless tool calls; resume with `-p --resume`). See [Decision Control](#decision-control-pretooluse). Do NOT roll your own confirmation schemes (env-var flags, interactive `osascript` prompts, bypass tokens) — those break the built-in UX and silently fail under existing `permissions.allow` entries.

**Codex exception**: Codex `PreToolUse` does not support `"ask"` yet. In Codex configs, use `deny` / exit code 2 for hard blocks, `additionalContext` for advisory context, or Codex approval policy/permissions for native prompts.

**Disable all hooks**: set `disableAllHooks: true` in settings.json.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Request

Parse what the user wants:
- **Add/Create**: New hook for specific event and tool
- **List/Show**: Display current hooks configuration
- **Remove/Delete**: Remove specific hook(s)
- **Update/Modify**: Change existing hook
- **Validate**: Check hooks for errors

### 2. Validate Before Writing

Always run validation before saving:
```bash
python3 "$SKILL_PATH/scripts/validate_hooks.py" ~/.claude/settings.json
```

### 3. Read Current Configuration

```bash
cat ~/.claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```

### 4. Apply Changes

Use Edit tool for modifications, Write tool for new files.

## Adding Hooks

### Translate Natural Language to Hook Config

| User Says | Event | Matcher | Notes |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|
| "log all bash commands" | PreToolUse | Bash | Logging to file |
| "format files after edit" | PostToolUse | Edit\|Write | Run formatter |
| "block .env file changes" | PreToolUse | Edit\|Write | Exit code 2 blocks |
| "notify me when done" | Notification | "" | Desktop notification |
| "run tests after code changes" | PostToolUse | Edit\|Write | Filter by extension |
| "ask before dangerous commands" | PreToolUse | Bash | Claude Code: emit JSON `permissionDecision: "ask"` (built-in confirm UI). Codex: use approval policy if possible; hook-level `ask` is unsupported. |
| "require manual approval for X" | PreToolUse | Bash/Edit/Write | Claude Code: emit JSON `permissionDecision: "ask"`, NOT exit 2. Codex: choose policy prompt or hard block. |
| "block unless confirmed" | PreToolUse | Bash | Claude Code: JSON `"ask"` lets the user approve per call. Codex: no hook-created confirmation prompt yet. |

### Hook Configuration Template

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "EVENT_NAME": [
      {
        "matcher": "TOOL_PATTERN",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "SHELL_COMMAND",
            "timeout": 60
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Simple vs Complex Hooks

**PREFER SCRIPT FILES** for complex hooks. Inline commands with nested quotes, `osascript`, or multi-step logic often break due to JSON escaping issues.

| Complexity | Approach | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Simple | Inline | `jq -r '.tool_input.command' >> log.txt` |
| Medium | Inline | Single grep/jq pipe with basic conditionals |
| Complex | **Script file** | Dialogs, multiple conditions, osascript, error handling |

**Script location**: `~/.claude/hooks/` (create if needed)

**Script template for PreToolUse** (`~/.claude/hooks/my-hook.sh`) — use JSON decision control as the primary mechanism; exit codes are a fallback for simple blocking only:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Read JSON input from stdin
input=$(cat)
cmd=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.tool_input.command')

# Your logic here
if echo "$cmd" | grep -q 'pattern-requiring-confirmation'; then
    # PRIMARY PATTERN for "require user confirmation": emit JSON on stdout.
    # Claude Code will show its built-in confirm prompt to the user.
    jq -n '{
      hookSpecificOutput: {
        hookEventName: "PreToolUse",
        permissionDecision: "ask",
        permissionDecisionReason: "Explain why this call is risky"
      }
    }'
    exit 0
fi

if echo "$cmd" | grep -q 'pattern-to-hard-block'; then
    # Hard block (no user override possible): JSON deny, NOT exit 2.
    jq -n '{
      hookSpecificOutput: {
        hookEventName: "PreToolUse",
        permissionDecision: "deny",
        permissionDecisionReason: "Reason shown to Claude"
      }
    }'
    exit 0
fi

exit 0  # Allow (silent)
```

**Why JSON decisions, not exit 2 or home-grown prompts:**
- `permissionDecision: "ask"` triggers the built-in Claude Code confirm UI — the user sees a clean prompt and can allow/deny per-call.
- `exit 2` is a blunt block; the user cannot override it from the UI, and Claude often re-tries with workarounds.
- Home-grown schemes (env-var flags like `CONFIRMED=1`, `osascript` dialogs, bypass tokens) break the native UX, leak into command history, and are silently bypassed if the tool already has a matching `permissions.allow` rule.

**Hook config using script**:
```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "command": "~/.claude/hooks/my-hook.sh"
}
```

**Other handler types (2026)**: `http` (POSTs event JSON to a URL), `mcp_tool` (calls a tool on a configured MCP server), `prompt` (evaluates a prompt with an LLM, supports `$ARGUMENTS`), `agent` (runs an agentic verifier with tools). Some events are command-only (PostCompact, PermissionDenied, Elicitation/ElicitationResult, FileChanged, CwdChanged, ConfigChange, InstructionsLoaded, WorktreeCreate/Remove, SubagentStart, StopFailure, TeammateIdle, SessionStart/End, Notification).

**Always**:
1. Create script in `~/.claude/hooks/`
2. Make executable: `chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/my-hook.sh`
3. Test with sample input: `echo '{"tool_input":{"command":"test"}}' | ~/.claude/hooks/my-hook.sh`

### Common Patterns

**Logging (PreToolUse)**:
```json
{
  "matcher": "Bash",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.command' >> ~/.claude/command-log.txt"
  }]
}
```

**File Protection (PreToolUse, exit 2 to block)**:
```json
{
  "matcher": "Edit|Write",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | grep -qE '(\\.env|secrets)' && exit 2 || exit 0"
  }]
}
```

**Auto-format (PostToolUse)**:
```json
{
  "matcher": "Edit|Write",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "file=$(jq -r '.tool_input.file_path'); [[ $file == *.ts ]] && npx prettier --write \"$file\" || true"
  }]
}
```

**Desktop Notification (Notification)**:
```json
{
  "matcher": "",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "osascript -e 'display notification \"Claude needs attention\" with title \"Claude Code\"'"
  }]
}
```

## Decision Control (Claude Code PreToolUse)

Claude Code PreToolUse hooks control tool execution by emitting JSON on stdout. This is the **default mechanism** — use it instead of exit codes whenever the intent is richer than "silently allow / hard block", especially when the user should be asked to confirm.

| `permissionDecision` | Behavior | Use for |
|----------------------|----------|---------|
| `"allow"` | Bypass permissions, proceed silently | Pre-approving a safe call |
| `"deny"` | Block, reason shown to Claude | Hard block (no user override) |
| `"ask"` | **Built-in Claude Code confirm UI** shown to user | "Require manual approval for X" — the canonical pattern |
| `"defer"` | Pause headless tool call, resume via `-p --resume` | External-system integrations in headless (`-p`) sessions |

Additional JSON fields:
- `permissionDecisionReason` — shown to the user for `"allow"`/`"ask"`, shown to Claude for `"deny"`
- `updatedInput` — modify tool input before execution
- `additionalContext` — inject context for Claude before the tool executes

### Ask user before dangerous command (the canonical pattern)

When the user says anything like **"require manual confirmation"**, **"ask before doing X"**, **"don't run Y without my approval"** — this is the pattern. Do not invent bypass env vars, `osascript` dialogs, or confirmation tokens. The built-in prompt already handles per-call allow/deny and is the only path that integrates with existing `permissions.allow` rules correctly.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
input=$(cat)
cmd=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // empty')

if echo "$cmd" | grep -qE 'supabase\s+db\s+reset'; then
    jq -n '{
      hookSpecificOutput: {
        hookEventName: "PreToolUse",
        permissionDecision: "ask",
        permissionDecisionReason: "This will destroy and recreate the local database."
      }
    }'
else
    exit 0
fi
```

### Deny with reason (hard block)

```bash
jq -n '{
  hookSpecificOutput: {
    hookEventName: "PreToolUse",
    permissionDecision: "deny",
    permissionDecisionReason: "Destructive command blocked by hook"
  }
}'
```

### Gotcha: `"ask"` vs existing `permissions.allow` rules

If the tool call already matches an entry in `.claude/settings.local.json` → `permissions.allow` (for example, `"Bash"` is blanket-allowed for this session), the hook's `"ask"` is **bypassed** and the call proceeds silently. Symptom: the hook appears to do nothing. Diagnose by reading `.claude/settings.local.json` and narrowing the allow rule, or remove the blanket allow for the matcher while the hook is in effect.

See [references/claude-event-schemas.md](references/claude-event-schemas.md) for the full output schema.

## Codex CLI / Codex App Hooks

As of June 2026, Codex hooks are enabled by default and are shared by Codex CLI, Codex IDE extension, and Codex App/desktop sessions through the same `~/.codex` and trusted project `.codex` configuration layers.

Current Codex lifecycle events:
- `SessionStart`
- `SubagentStart`
- `PreToolUse`
- `PermissionRequest`
- `PostToolUse`
- `PreCompact`
- `PostCompact`
- `UserPromptSubmit`
- `SubagentStop`
- `Stop`

Do not add the old feature flag for new configs. If hooks must be disabled, use:
```toml
[features]
hooks = false
```

Minimal PreToolUse blocking hook:
```toml
[[hooks.PreToolUse]]
matcher = "^Bash$"

[[hooks.PreToolUse.hooks]]
type = "command"
command = '/usr/bin/python3 ~/.codex/hooks/policy.py'
timeout = 30
statusMessage = "Checking Bash command"
```

Equivalent `~/.codex/hooks.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "^Bash$",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/usr/bin/python3 ~/.codex/hooks/policy.py",
            "timeout": 30,
            "statusMessage": "Checking Bash command"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Prefer one representation per config layer: either `hooks.json` or inline `[hooks]`. Codex loads both and warns if both exist in the same layer.

Blocking semantics: exit code `2` blocks (stderr is reason), or emit JSON `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse", "permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}`.

Important Codex gap: `PreToolUse` currently does **not** support `permissionDecision: "ask"`. Returning `"ask"` makes the hook run fail and Codex continues the tool call. For fail-closed behavior, map Claude-style `ask` to Codex `deny`.

When adapting a Claude Code `ask` hook to Codex, prefer this order:
1. Use hard `deny` / exit 2 when the command must not run without review.
2. If the risky action can be expressed as command argv prefixes and the user explicitly accepts best-effort native Codex prompts, use Codex rules for the prompt and keep the hook silent for that exact reason code.
3. Do not put the whole hook into shadow mode unless you intentionally want logging only; that allows every risky action the hook would otherwise catch.

For bash-guard specifically, Codex live mode defaults to hard `deny` for internal `ask` decisions. Only reason codes listed in `BASH_GUARD_CODEX_DEFER_REASON_CODES` are allowed to pass through to execpolicy, and installers only add that env var when the user passes `--codex-native-prompts`. Each deferred reason code must have a matching `prefix_rule(... decision="prompt")`; otherwise the risky command would be silently allowed.

`PermissionRequest` only fires when Codex is already about to ask for approval. It can return `allow`, `deny`, or no decision; it cannot create a prompt for commands that Codex would otherwise run without asking.

Codex `PreToolUse` can intercept Bash, `apply_patch` file edits, and MCP tool calls, but it is not a complete enforcement boundary: interception of richer shell paths is incomplete, and WebSearch / non-shell / non-MCP tool calls are out of scope.

See [references/codex-hooks.md](references/codex-hooks.md) for full Codex hooks reference, all event input/output schemas, common patterns, and migration from the legacy `AfterAgent` / `AfterToolUse` events.

## OpenCode Hooks (Plugin-based)

OpenCode (anomalyco/opencode v1.14.x) does NOT use config-based shell hooks. Hooks are TypeScript/JavaScript **plugins** that subscribe to lifecycle events. The closest analogue to `PreToolUse` is `tool.execute.before` — throwing inside it blocks the tool call.

```typescript
// .opencode/plugins/env-protection.ts
import type { Plugin } from "@opencode-ai/plugin"

export default (async () => ({
  tool: {
    execute: {
      before: async (input, output) => {
        if (output.args.filePath?.includes(".env")) {
          throw new Error("Reading .env is forbidden")
        }
      },
    },
  },
})) satisfies Plugin
```

**Plugin locations**:
- Project: `.opencode/plugins/*.ts`
- Global: `~/.config/opencode/plugins/*.ts`
- npm packages: listed in `opencode.json` under `plugin: []`

**Common events**: `tool.execute.before`, `tool.execute.after`, `session.idle`, `session.created`, `file.edited`, `permission.asked`, `command.executed` (~25 total).

**Critical caveat (v1.14.x)**: `tool.execute.*` hooks **do NOT** fire for MCP tool calls — use the `permission` block in `opencode.json` to control MCP tool access instead.

For "ask before" semantics, prefer `permission` rules over plugin throws — they integrate with the built-in confirm UI:
```json
{ "permission": { "bash": { "rm -rf *": "ask" } } }
```

See [references/opencode-hooks.md](references/opencode-hooks.md) for the full event catalog, migration patterns from Claude Code hooks, and npm plugin distribution.

## Event Input Schemas

See [references/claude-event-schemas.md](references/claude-event-schemas.md) for complete JSON input schemas for each event type (Claude Code).

## Validation

Run validation script to check hooks:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_PATH/scripts/validate_hooks.py" <settings-file>
```

Validates:
- JSON syntax
- Required fields (type, command/prompt)
- Valid event names
- Matcher patterns (regex validity)
- Command syntax basics

## Removing Hooks

1. Read current config
2. Identify hook by event + matcher + command pattern
3. Remove from hooks array
4. If array empty, remove the matcher entry
5. If event empty, remove event key
6. Validate and save

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| 0 | Success/Allow | Continue execution |
| 2 | Block | Simple blocking (prefer JSON decision control for PreToolUse) |
| Other | Error | Log to stderr, shown in verbose mode |

## Security Checklist

Before adding hooks, verify:
- [ ] No credential logging
- [ ] No sensitive data exposure
- [ ] Specific matchers (avoid `*` when possible)
- [ ] Validated input parsing
- [ ] Appropriate timeout for long operations

## Troubleshooting

**Hook not triggering**: Check matcher case-sensitivity, ensure event name is exact.

**Command failing**: Test command standalone with sample JSON input.

**Permission denied**: Ensure script is executable (`chmod +x`).

**Timeout**: Increase timeout field or optimize command.
