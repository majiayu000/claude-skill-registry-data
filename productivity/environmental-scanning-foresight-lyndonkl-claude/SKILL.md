## Purpose

Environmental scanning and foresight helps organizations anticipate change by systematically monitoring external trends, detecting weak signals before they become obvious, and preparing for multiple possible futures. This skill guides you through PESTLE analysis, horizon scanning, scenario development, and early warning systems to inform strategic planning and adaptive decision-making.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- **Strategic planning**: Scanning external environment for 3-5 year strategic plans, identifying opportunities and threats
- **Weak signal detection**: Monitoring early indicators of change that others might miss (regulatory shifts, technology breakthroughs, consumer behavior changes)
- **Scenario planning**: Developing multiple plausible futures to test strategy robustness across different conditions
- **Trend analysis**: Tracking PESTLE forces (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental) affecting industry or domain
- **Early warning systems**: Setting signposts and indicators to trigger adaptive responses before trends become crises
- **Innovation foresight**: Identifying emerging technologies or business models that could disrupt current operations
- **Risk monitoring**: Tracking geopolitical, climate, or market risks that could impact long-term plans
- **Regulatory anticipation**: Scanning policy developments and regulatory trends to prepare compliance or advocacy strategies

Trigger phrases: "environmental scan", "horizon scanning", "PESTLE analysis", "weak signals", "scenario planning", "strategic foresight", "futures", "emerging trends", "early warning", "signposts"

## What Is It?

Environmental scanning is the systematic collection and analysis of information about external forces, events, and trends. Foresight extends this by using scanning results to anticipate plausible futures and prepare adaptive strategies.

**Quick example:**

**Scenario**: Electric vehicle manufacturer planning 2025-2030 strategy

**Environmental scan** identifies:
- **Political**: 15 countries announced ICE vehicle bans (2030-2040)
- **Economic**: Battery costs declining 15%/year, approaching parity with ICE
- **Social**: Consumer EV consideration jumped from 20% to 45% (2020-2023)
- **Technological**: Charging time reduced from 60min to 15min (fast chargers)
- **Legal**: EPA tightening emissions standards, favoring zero-emission
- **Environmental**: Climate commitments driving corporate fleet electrification

**Weak signal detected**: Toyota investing $13B in battery production (usually slow to EV). Signal: Major holdout shifting = tipping point approaching.

**Scenario planning**:
- **Rapid transition** (30% probability): ICE ban enforcement accelerates, charging infrastructure deployed fast → Scale EV production aggressively
- **Gradual transition** (50% probability): Current trajectory continues, mix of EV/ICE 2030 → Balanced portfolio approach
- **Reversal** (20% probability): Political backlash, grid capacity limits slow adoption → Maintain ICE capability, hedge bets

**Signposts set**:
- If EV market share >20% by 2026 → Accelerate (currently 14%)
- If 3+ countries delay bans → Hedge strategy (currently 0)
- If battery costs <$80/kWh by 2025 → Full commitment (currently $120/kWh)

**Result**: Strategy prepared for multiple futures, with clear triggers for adaptation.

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Environmental Scanning Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Define scope and focus areas
- [ ] Step 2: Scan PESTLE forces and trends
- [ ] Step 3: Detect and validate weak signals
- [ ] Step 4: Assess cross-impacts and interactions
- [ ] Step 5: Develop scenarios for plausible futures
- [ ] Step 6: Set signposts and adaptive triggers
```

**Step 1: Define scope and focus areas**

Clarify scanning theme (technology disruption, market evolution, regulatory shift), geographic scope (global, regional, local), time horizon (short 1-2yr, medium 3-5yr, long 5-10yr+), and key uncertainties to explore. See [resources/template.md](resources/template.md#scanning-scope-definition) for scoping framework.

**Step 2: Scan PESTLE forces and trends**

Systematically collect trends across Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental dimensions. Identify drivers of change (demographics, technology, policy), assess magnitude and direction, and track sources (reports, data, news, expert views). See [resources/template.md](resources/template.md#pestle-scanning-framework) for structured scanning.

**Step 3: Detect and validate weak signals**

Identify early indicators that diverge from mainstream expectations—anomalies, edge cases, emergent behaviors. Validate signal credibility (source quality, supporting evidence, plausibility) and assess potential impact if signal amplifies. See [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md#weak-signal-detection) for detection techniques.

**Step 4: Assess cross-impacts and interactions**

Map how trends interact (reinforcing, offsetting, cascading). Identify critical uncertainties (high impact + high uncertainty) and predetermined elements (high impact + low uncertainty). See [resources/methodology.md](resources/methodology.md#cross-impact-analysis) for interaction mapping.

**Step 5: Develop scenarios for plausible futures**

Create 3-4 distinct, internally consistent scenarios spanning range of outcomes. Build scenarios around critical uncertainties (axes with most impact), develop narrative logic, and test strategies against each scenario. See [resources/template.md](resources/template.md#scenario-development-template) for scenario structure.

**Step 6: Set signposts and adaptive triggers**

Define leading indicators to monitor, set thresholds that trigger strategy adjustment, and establish monitoring cadence (monthly, quarterly, annual). Validate using [resources/evaluators/rubric_environmental_scanning_foresight.json](resources/evaluators/rubric_environmental_scanning_foresight.json). **Minimum standard**: Average score ≥ 3.5.

## Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: Industry Disruption Scanning**
- **Focus**: Technology shifts, business model innovation, competitive dynamics
- **PESTLE emphasis**: Technological (new capabilities), Economic (cost curves), Social (adoption patterns)
- **Weak signals**: Startups with novel approaches, technology breakthroughs in adjacent fields, early adopter behavior
- **Scenarios**: Disruption speed (rapid vs gradual), winning model (incumbent adaptation vs new entrant dominance)
- **Example**: Media industry scanning streaming, AI content generation, attention economy shifts

**Pattern 2: Regulatory & Policy Foresight**
- **Focus**: Government policy, regulatory trends, compliance requirements
- **PESTLE emphasis**: Political (election outcomes, party positions), Legal (regulatory proposals, court decisions)
- **Weak signals**: Pilot programs, stakeholder consultations, legislative drafts in one jurisdiction presaging others
- **Scenarios**: Stringency (light touch vs heavy regulation), speed (gradual vs sudden), scope (sector-specific vs economy-wide)
- **Example**: Finance sector scanning crypto regulation, data privacy laws, central bank digital currencies

**Pattern 3: Market Evolution & Consumer Trends**
- **Focus**: Customer behavior, demand patterns, value shifts
- **PESTLE emphasis**: Social (demographics, values, lifestyle), Economic (income, spending), Technological (enabling platforms)
- **Weak signals**: Subculture behaviors, Gen Z early adoption, influencer/creator economy patterns
- **Scenarios**: Value proposition evolution (what customers prioritize), channel dominance (where they buy), price sensitivity
- **Example**: Retail scanning sustainability values, experiences over ownership, social commerce

**Pattern 4: Geopolitical & Macro Risk Monitoring**
- **Focus**: Political stability, trade relations, conflict risk, economic conditions
- **PESTLE emphasis**: Political (elections, tensions), Economic (growth, inflation, debt), Environmental (climate, resources)
- **Weak signals**: Diplomatic incidents, policy U-turns, capital flows, social unrest indicators
- **Scenarios**: Geopolitical alignment (cooperation vs fragmentation), economic regime (growth vs stagnation), resource availability
- **Example**: Multinational scanning supply chain resilience, tariff risks, energy security

**Pattern 5: Climate & Sustainability Foresight**
- **Focus**: Climate impacts, transition risks, sustainability regulations, stakeholder pressure
- **PESTLE emphasis**: Environmental (physical risks, biodiversity), Political (climate policy), Social (public opinion), Legal (disclosure rules)
- **Weak signals**: Extreme weather anomalies, stranded asset warnings, investor divestment, youth climate activism
- **Scenarios**: Transition speed (orderly vs disorderly), policy stringency (ambitious vs incremental), physical impacts (moderate vs severe)
- **Example**: Energy company scanning net-zero commitments, carbon pricing, renewable cost curves, grid resilience

## Guardrails

**Critical requirements:**

1. **Scan systematically, not selectively**: Cover all PESTLE dimensions (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental) even if some seem less relevant. Selective scanning creates blind spots. Weak signals often appear in unexpected domains.

2. **Distinguish weak signals from noise**: Weak signals are early indicators with potential impact, not every random anomaly. Validate: Does source have credibility? Is there supporting evidence? Is amplification plausible? Is impact significant if it scales? Avoid signal inflation (calling everything a weak signal).

3. **Scenarios must be plausible, not preferred or feared**: Scenarios are not predictions or wish fulfillment. They should span range of outcomes based on critical uncertainties, be internally consistent (logic holds), and challenge current assumptions. Avoid creating only optimistic scenarios or dystopian extremes.

4. **Critical uncertainties have high impact AND high uncertainty**: Not all trends are critical uncertainties for scenario building. Use 2x2 matrix: High impact + low uncertainty = predetermined elements (plan for them). High impact + high uncertainty = critical uncertainties (build scenarios around). Low impact = context (note but don't scenario around).

5. **Cross-impacts matter as much as individual trends**: Trends interact (AI + climate policy + geopolitics). Reinforcing trends accelerate (renewable cost decline + climate policy + corporate commitments). Offsetting trends create tension (privacy vs personalization). Cascading trends trigger others (pandemic → remote work → office demand collapse). Map interactions, don't treat trends in isolation.

6. **Signposts must be observable and leading, not lagging**: Signposts trigger adaptation before full trend materializes. Leading indicators precede outcomes (building permits before housing prices). Lagging indicators confirm but arrive too late (GDP growth rate). Threshold must be specific (">20% market share" not "significant adoption") and monitorable (data exists, update frequency known).

7. **Foresight informs strategy, doesn't dictate it**: Scenarios reveal possibilities and test strategy robustness, but don't automatically prescribe action. Strategy choices depend on risk appetite, resources, values. Use scenarios to stress-test plans ("does our strategy work in scenarios A, B, C?") and identify no-regrets moves (work in all scenarios) vs hedges (work in some).

8. **Update scans regularly, not once**: Environmental conditions change. Set scanning cadence (quarterly PESTLE review, monthly weak signal scan, annual scenario update). Stale scans miss emerging trends. Rigid scenarios ignore new information. Foresight is continuous monitoring, not one-time exercise.

**Common pitfalls:**

- ❌ **Confirmation bias in scanning**: Only collecting evidence supporting existing beliefs. Seek disconfirming evidence, alternate views.
- ❌ **Extrapolating linearly**: Assuming current trends continue unchanged. Consider inflection points, reversals, discontinuities.
- ❌ **Treating scenarios as predictions**: Scenarios are not forecasts. No probabilities assigned (or equal probability). They explore "what if" not "what will".
- ❌ **Too many scenarios (>4)**: Overwhelming decision-makers, diluting focus. Aim for 3-4 distinct scenarios covering key uncertainties.
- ❌ **Ignoring wild cards**: Low-probability, high-impact events (pandemic, breakthrough, collapse). Acknowledge them even if not primary scenarios.
- ❌ **Anchoring to recent past**: Recency bias makes recent events (pandemic, financial crisis) loom large. Consider longer historical patterns.
