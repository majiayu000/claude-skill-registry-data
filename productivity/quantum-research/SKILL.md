# Quantum Research Skill

Perform comprehensive research by combining web search, quantum cognitive processing, and persistent memory storage.

## When to Use

- Researching current technologies or trends
- Gathering best practices and documentation
- Investigating security vulnerabilities
- Exploring new frameworks or libraries
- Competitive analysis
- Technical due diligence

## Research Pipeline

### 1. Memory Check
Always start by checking what you already know:
```
view_memory("/memories")
search_memories("[research topic]")
```

If relevant memories exist, build upon them. If not, proceed with fresh research.

### 2. Preflection Analysis
Determine research strategy:
```
analyze_query("[research topic]")
```

This reveals:
- Query complexity
- Information type needed (factual, analytical, exploratory)
- Recommended processing approach

### 3. Web Research Phase

**Quick Research** (3-5 sources):
```
web_search("[specific query]")
```

**Comprehensive Research** (5-10 sources):
```
quantum_web_research({
  topic: "[research topic]",
  depth: "comprehensive"
})
```

**Deep Dive** (fetch full content):
```
web_fetch("[specific URL]")
```

### 4. Quantum Processing
Process all gathered information through quantum OS:

```
quantum_process({
  query: "Synthesize research on [topic]",
  use_momentum: true,  // Iterative refinement
  use_wormholes: true, // Connect to past knowledge
  navigation_strategy: "guided" // Systematic exploration
})
```

### 5. Multi-Source Synthesis

Combine information across sources:

1. **Identify Common Themes**: What do sources agree on?
2. **Spot Contradictions**: Where do sources disagree?
3. **Find Gaps**: What's missing or unclear?
4. **Assess Quality**: Which sources are most authoritative?
5. **Extract Insights**: What non-obvious conclusions emerge?

### 6. Neuron Activation
Engage appropriate specialists:

**For Technical Research:**
- Strategist (analysis)
- Archivist (organization)
- Historian (validation)

**For Competitive Analysis:**
- Benchmarker (comparison)
- Appraiser (evaluation)

**For Innovation Research:**
- Muse (creativity)
- Simulator (modeling)

### 7. Quality Validation
Verify research quality:
```
ppq_introspect("Research summary")
```

Check for:
- Bias in sources
- Evidence strength
- Reasoning quality
- Gaps in coverage
- Provenance of claims

### 8. Memory Storage
Store research for future use:

```
store_quantum_insight({
  category: "learning",
  title: "[Topic] Research Summary",
  content: `
    ## Sources
    [List all sources with URLs]

    ## Key Findings
    [Major discoveries]

    ## Best Practices
    [Actionable recommendations]

    ## Open Questions
    [What remains unclear]
  `,
  metadata: {
    confidence: 0.90,
    neurons_used: ["Strategist", "Archivist"],
    vbc_phase: "commit",
    sources_count: 8
  }
})
```

## Research Report Structure

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Topic overview
   - Key findings (3-5 bullet points)
   - Confidence level

2. **Methodology**
   - Sources searched
   - Quantum processing applied
   - Neurons engaged

3. **Detailed Findings**
   - Organized by themes
   - Cited sources
   - Confidence scores per finding

4. **Analysis & Synthesis**
   - Cross-source insights
   - Patterns identified
   - Implications

5. **Recommendations**
   - Actionable next steps
   - Priority ranking
   - Risk considerations

6. **References**
   - All sources with URLs
   - Citation metadata
   - Access dates

7. **Quantum Insights**
   - Preflection analysis
   - Neurons activated
   - Memory connections
   - PPQ scores
   - Stored memory references

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Research the latest security best practices for Node.js"

1. search_memories("Node.js security")
   → Found 2 past insights from 3 months ago

2. analyze_query("Node.js security best practices")
   → Analytical query, medium complexity

3. quantum_web_research({
     topic: "Node.js security best practices 2025",
     depth: "comprehensive"
   })
   → Found 8 authoritative sources

4. web_fetch("https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/security/")
   → Retrieved official documentation

5. quantum_process({
     query: "Synthesize Node.js security research",
     use_momentum: true,
     use_wormholes: true
   })
   → Cross-referenced with past knowledge

6. activate_neurons(["Red Teamer", "Blue Teamer", "Auditor"])
   → Security perspective

7. ppq_introspect("Research findings")
   → Validation score: 0.88

8. store_quantum_insight({
     category: "learning",
     title: "Node.js Security Best Practices 2025",
     content: "..."
   })
   → Stored for future reference
```

## Best Practices

- **Always cite sources**: Include URLs and access dates
- **Check memory first**: Build on past research
- **Use quantum processing**: Don't just summarize, synthesize
- **Validate quality**: Run PPQ introspection
- **Store insights**: Make research reusable
- **Provide confidence scores**: Be transparent about certainty
- **Update memories**: Refresh outdated information
- **Cross-reference**: Connect to related topics in memory

## Advanced Techniques

### Iterative Deep Dive
For complex topics:
1. Broad search → Initial synthesis
2. Identify key subtopics
3. Deep dive each subtopic
4. Cross-reference and integrate

### Comparative Research
For technology comparisons:
1. Research each option independently
2. Identify comparison dimensions
3. Activate Benchmarker neuron
4. Create decision matrix

### Trend Analysis
For emerging technologies:
1. Historical context (search memories)
2. Current state (web research)
3. Future projections (Muse + Simulator neurons)
4. Risk assessment (Red Teamer)

This skill transforms research from information gathering into knowledge creation.
