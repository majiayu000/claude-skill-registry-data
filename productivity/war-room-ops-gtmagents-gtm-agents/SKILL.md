# War-Room Operations Skill

## When to Use
- Launches requiring daily standups and cross-functional coordination.
- Managing high-risk windows (launch week, pricing changes, major PR events).
- Ensuring swift resolution of issues and clear stakeholder comms.

## Framework
1. **Cadence & Channels** – schedule standups, async updates, and escalation channels (Slack, pager, email).
2. **Rituals** – agenda for standups (status, blockers, metrics), risk reviews, exec syncs.
3. **Escalation Paths** – define severity levels, decision owners, fallback contacts.
4. **Documentation** – central log for decisions, incidents, mitigations, deployments.
5. **Monitoring Hooks** – dashboards, alert routing, on-call rotations, support coverage.

## Templates
- War-room charter (objectives, team, schedule, SLAs).
- Standup template (status, blockers, next actions, owners).
- Escalation matrix (severity, trigger, contact tree, resolution target).

## Tips
- Keep war-room staffed with empowered decision makers.
- Record all decisions + rationale for post-launch retros.
- Automate reminders for updates to reduce noise.
