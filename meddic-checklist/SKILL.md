# MEDDIC Checklist Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing for discovery or validation calls to ensure all MEDDIC elements are captured.
- Reviewing calls for deal inspection or forecast commits.
- Coaching reps on multi-threading and qualification rigor.

## Framework
1. **Metrics** – quantify current/target KPIs and business outcomes.
2. **Economic Buyer** – identify budget owner, influence level, and access plan.
3. **Decision Criteria** – capture technical, commercial, security requirements.
4. **Decision Process** – map steps, stakeholders, procurement/legal milestones.
5. **Implications** – articulate business pain, urgency, and impact of inaction.
6. **Champion** – assess strength, influence, and next actions to reinforce support.

## Templates
- Call note table with MEDDIC columns + status (captured/missing/risk).
- Deal inspection dashboard snippet showing coverage per opportunity.
- Coaching worksheet for reps/managers.

## Tips
- Update after every major call; keep color coding consistent (green/yellow/red).
- Tie each MEDDIC gap to a specific next step.
- Pair with `call-analysis-framework` outputs to ensure evidence is captured.
