# Superior Trade Lighter

Use this skill for Lighter market discovery, Nautilus backtests and deployments,
managed-wallet checks, and supported typed executions through Unified API.

Read [`../../references/unified-runtime.md`](../../references/unified-runtime.md)
before making any request. The OpenAPI contract, not older venue workflows,
defines which Lighter operations are available.

**Base URL:** `https://api.superior.trade`
**Auth:** `x-api-key: $SUPERIOR_TRADE_API_KEY`
**Venue config:** `{ "venue": "lighter", "instrument_id": "<SYMBOL>.LIGHTER" }`

## Unified API only

Read [`../../references/unified-runtime.md`](../../references/unified-runtime.md)
before onboarding, backtesting, deployment, or execution. Use `GET /context/venues`
and `GET /runtime/frameworks` first, then the Unified runtime endpoints. If the
contract does not expose the required Lighter operation, report it as
unavailable.

## Robinhood Chain Variant

Use the separate `lighter-robinhood` skill and venue name for Robinhood Chain Lighter. Do not treat `lighter-robinhood` as an alias for this default `lighter` profile; it uses a different venue profile, chain id, deposit asset, and instrument suffix.

## Safety Rules

- Never ask for private keys, seed phrases, API private keys, passwords, or wallet credentials.
- Never log, echo, store, or display secrets. The only credential an agent should use is `SUPERIOR_TRADE_API_KEY`.
- Never move funds or start live trading without explicit user confirmation.
- Never submit a Lighter order without explicit user confirmation of market, side, size, order type, and risk.
- Treat any contract-supported Lighter deposit or withdrawal as a real fund-moving action.
- Do not retry an ambiguous execution or withdrawal automatically. Read its durable status and report the persisted state.
- Do not claim managed-wallet funds are available on Lighter unless Unified API returns the required readiness and balance evidence.
- Do not claim Lighter readiness or balance without querying the API.
- If onboarding, CCTP funding, delayed withdrawal, or signed proxy submission is
  absent from `GET /openapi.json`, report it as unavailable.

## Account readiness

Read the managed wallet with `GET /wallet` and venue support with
`GET /context/venues`. Do not infer a Lighter-specific account state machine
from generic wallet history. If Unified API does not return the readiness data
needed for a live deployment, report the deployment as unavailable rather than
reusing an older onboarding flow.

## Related Skills

- Use `superior-trade-auth` first when the user needs an API key.
- Use `trade-thesis` before deploying a new live strategy idea.
- Use `hyperliquid` for Hyperliquid workflows. Lighter deployments use the same Unified runtime lifecycle with the Nautilus framework.
