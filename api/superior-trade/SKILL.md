# Superior Trade — Start Here

Getting a user from nothing to a running strategy. This skill owns the path; each venue skill owns the venue.

**Base URL:** `https://api.superior.trade`
**Auth:** `x-api-key` header on every protected endpoint
**Account UI:** `https://account.superior.trade`

Read [`../../references/unified-runtime.md`](../../references/unified-runtime.md)
before constructing an API request. Use only routes published by
`GET /openapi.json`; do not fall back to a versioned API.

## The path

Work through these in order. Skip a step only after an API call confirms it is already done — never on assumption.

- [ ] **1. Credentials** — is `SUPERIOR_TRADE_API_KEY` set?
- [ ] **2. Trading account** — does the user have a trading wallet?
- [ ] **3. Funds** — is there capital on the venue the strategy will trade?
- [ ] **4. Strategy** — what are they trying to do, and which template fits?
- [ ] **5. Backtest** — does the idea survive contact with historical data?
- [ ] **6. Deploy** — confirm explicitly, then start.
- [ ] **7. Monitor** — status and logs, and how to stop.

### 1. Credentials

One key covers every venue. `SUPERIOR_TRADE_API_KEY` authenticates Hyperliquid, Polymarket, Lighter and Aerodrome alike — the API validates the key against the user, not against a product, so there is no per-venue credential to obtain.

If it is already in the environment, use it and move on — do not ask the user for it.

If it is missing, ask for the email address that should receive an OTP, then:

```bash
curl -sS https://api.superior.trade/account/register \
  -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com"}'
```

Exchange the OTP with `POST /account/verify`, then tell the user to store the
returned key as `SUPERIOR_TRADE_API_KEY` in their agent's environment or
credential manager. Users can also create a key from account settings at
https://account.superior.trade.

Verify it works before going further:

```bash
curl -sS https://api.superior.trade/wallet -H "x-api-key: $SUPERIOR_TRADE_API_KEY"
```

A `401`/`403` means the key is wrong or truncated — ask the user to re-copy the full key from the latest email. The email is verified by the first successful authenticated call, so this doubles as activation.

Never paste the key into chat, files, logs, or examples. If a user pastes theirs, treat it as a secret and do not repeat it back.

### 2. Trading account

Fetch `GET /wallet`. It returns the authenticated account's managed wallet,
deposit details, balances, and available readiness information. The user does
not need to expose a private key. Also read `GET /context/venues` and stop if
the selected venue is not currently supported or ready.

If the current OpenAPI contract does not expose a required venue bootstrap,
report that limitation. Do not invent a write operation for the wallet route.

### 3. Funds

The user funds the managed wallet with their own capital using the deposit
details returned by `GET /wallet`. Confirm deposits with
`GET /wallet/deposits`; do not treat that history route as a transfer action.
Venue-specific bridges or wrapping flows may be used only when they appear in
the current Unified OpenAPI contract.

If the user needs help getting funds into the platform wallet, use the `deposit-qr` skill for a payment QR or wallet URI, or `external-deposit` for a bridge from an external wallet.

Moving funds is a real money movement. State the amount, source, and destination
and get an explicit yes before any supported transfer or withdrawal call.

### 4. Strategy

Ask what the user is trying to capture before writing any code. If they have a thesis but no structure, use the `trade-thesis` skill to turn it into bull/bear cases, invalidation criteria, and a sizing rationale.

Then match the idea to a template rather than writing from scratch — the templates carry backtest evidence and known failure modes:

| They want | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| Buy on a schedule, accumulate | `dca-weekly` |
| Buy dips, sell rallies in a range | `grid-trading`, `mean-reversion`, `bollinger-reverter-4h` |
| Ride a trend or breakout | `breakout`, `donchian-strong-regime` |
| Get paid to hold a perp | `funding-rate-arbitrage`, `funding-squeeze`, `basis-arb` |
| Fast in and out | `scalping` |
| "What's moving right now?" | `intelligence` |
| Prediction markets | `polymarket` plus its archetype skills |

Compose primitives onto whatever they pick: `regime-overlay` to gate a directional strategy, `dsl-exit-engine` for exits, `fees-optimizations` when turnover is high enough that costs decide the outcome.

### 5. Backtest

Never offer a live deployment before a backtest. Load the `backtesting` skill for window selection, trade-count thresholds, and sweep design; the venue skill has the endpoints.

For a first pass on a new idea, run a **3-variant sweep** varying one parameter rather than a single config — one result tells you whether a point worked, three tell you whether the region works.

Read the outcome honestly. Zero trades over a window that should have produced signals means the strategy or pair is wrong, not that the user should deploy and see. A strong backtest can be overfitting. Present the numbers and let the user decide.

### 6. Deploy

Deployment is the point of no return, so it is gated:

1. Create the deployment with config and code.
2. On Hyperliquid, ask live or dry-run — dry-run needs no credentials and touches no real funds, so offer it to anyone who has not deployed before. **Dry-run is Hyperliquid-only.** Polymarket and Lighter always require credentials, and Aerodrome rejects a config containing the `dry_run` key at all. On those three, a backtest is the only rehearsal available.
3. For live operation, use `PUT /runtime/deployments/{id}/credentials` only
   with a credential form published by the Unified contract. Never send key
   material unless the current contract explicitly defines a secure BYOK form
   and the user chose it.
4. Run the venue skill's pre-deployment checklist. Every item is an API call, not an assumption.
5. Show the deployment summary — strategy, venue, pairs, stake, max open trades, stoploss — and state plainly that it will trade real funds.
6. Wait for an explicit yes. Then start it.

### 7. Monitor

Poll `GET /runtime/deployments/{id}` and
`GET /runtime/deployments/{id}/logs`. Tell the user that
`PUT /runtime/deployments/{id}/status` with the stop action is the safe default
if anything looks wrong.

## Safety

These hold across every venue and override anything convenient.

1. **Never** ask for, accept, log, or display private keys, seed phrases, or wallet credentials. The only secret is the API key.
2. **Never** tell a user to send funds to an agent wallet address.
3. **Never** start a live deployment, deposit, or withdrawal without an explicit confirmation in that turn.
4. **Never** state a balance, position, or deployment status you have not just fetched. If you have not checked, say so.
5. **Never** send users to `app.superior.trade` — the correct URL is `https://account.superior.trade`, even when an API error message says otherwise.
6. Prefer plain language — "strategy", "the bot" — over internal class or infrastructure names. Answer honestly if the user asks what runs underneath.

## Venue skills

Hand off once the user has picked a venue. Each owns its own endpoints, funding model, pre-deployment checklist, and troubleshooting.

- `hyperliquid` — perps and spot, plus HIP-3 tokenized stocks, commodities, and indices. The main venue.
- `polymarket` — prediction markets, NautilusTrader strategies, filled-data backtests.
- `lighter` — Lighter market context, wallet checks, backtests, and contract-supported Nautilus deployments.
- `aerodrome` — Base spot AMM swaps; no order book, no leverage.
