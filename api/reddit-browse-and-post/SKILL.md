# Reddit Browse & Post

Let an agent read Reddit by default, and publish only after the user explicitly opts in and approves the exact post. Everything here is account-agnostic: the user supplies credentials through environment variables or a browser login, never through chat.

## Default mode: read-only

Browsing, searching, and reading threads/comments are the default capabilities. They do not require a paid service, MCP, Reddit account, or OAuth app when the public JSON endpoints are reachable.

Posting, editing, deleting, voting, and moderator actions are separate write paths. Do not expose or invoke them merely because this skill is installed: require an explicit user request and approval of the exact action and target; for publishing, also require approval of the exact destination and content.

## Hard rules

- **Never ask the user to paste a Reddit password, token, or cookie into chat.** Credentials go into environment variables (profile `.env`) or the user logs in via the browser themselves.
- **Posting is an irreversible publish action.** Draft the title and body, show the user exactly what will be posted and where, and get explicit approval before submitting. No exceptions for "the user already asked."
- **Never edit, delete, vote, or mod-queue anything without explicit approval.**
- Respect subreddit rules: read the sidebar / rules (or `about/rules.json`) before posting to a subreddit you have not posted to.
- Respect rate limits: keep requests under ~1/second for reads; wait at least a minute between post attempts. Respect 429/403 responses and back off.
- Respect Reddit's User Agreement, Developer Terms, and robots/access restrictions. Do not bulk-harvest content or evade access controls.
- Do not post spam, affiliate links, or promotional content unless the user explicitly directs it.
- Vote manipulation, ban evasion, and buying/selling accounts are off-limits.

## Reading Reddit

Reddit's public JSON endpoints (`/r/<sub>/.json`, `/search.json`, `/comments/<id>.json`) work without credentials **when the network allows it** — but Reddit's anti-bot layer frequently returns a 403 HTML block page for plain `curl` requests, even with a custom User-Agent. **Do not fight it:** try one curl probe, and if it comes back as HTML/403, switch immediately to one of the reliable paths below.

Reliable paths, in order:

1. **Authenticated API** (recommended when public JSON is blocked — works from any network): get an OAuth token (setup below) and read through `https://oauth.reddit.com` with `Authorization: bearer ***`. Same endpoints, dramatically higher rate limits, and it doubles as the separately approved posting path.
2. **Hermes browser tools** — navigate to the target page; the browser session passes Reddit's checks. Good for JS-gated pages and logged-in work.

If a plain-curl probe does work from the user's network:

```bash
# Subreddit listing
curl -s -A "hermes-agent/1.0 by <username>" "https://www.reddit.com/r/<subreddit>/.json?limit=25"

# Search
curl -s -A "hermes-agent/1.0 by <username>" "https://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=<query>&sort=relevance&limit=25"

# Single thread (includes top-level comments in the second JSON block)
curl -s -A "hermes-agent/1.0 by <username>" "https://www.reddit.com/r/<subreddit>/comments/<post_id>.json?limit=100"

# Subreddit rules (check before posting)
curl -s -A "hermes-agent/1.0 by <username>" "https://www.reddit.com/r/<subreddit>/about/rules.json"
```

Tips:
- **Always send a unique, descriptive User-Agent** (for example `hermes-agent/1.0 by <username>`) — a generic or browser-spoofed client string is not a reliable access strategy and Reddit may still block the network/IP.
- Prefer `old.reddit.com` for JSON stability if a request is blocked or returns HTML.
- `limit` max is 100. Paginate with `after=<fullname>` (e.g. `t3_abc123`).
- If a listing returns 403/429, wait several seconds and retry once; then fall back to the OAuth or browser path.

## Authenticated posting (OAuth app — recommended)

### One-time setup (user does this)

1. Create a **script** app at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps (name anything; type: script; redirect uri: `http://localhost:8080` — unused for script apps).
2. Copy the client ID (under the app name) and secret.
3. Put them in the profile's `.env`:

```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=...
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
REDDIT_USERNAME=...
REDDIT_PASSWORD=...
```

Script apps use the account's own password grant; no separate consent flow needed.

### Getting a token (from the agent)

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -u "$REDDIT_CLIENT_ID:$REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET" \
 -d "grant_type=password&username=$REDDIT_USERNAME&password=$REDDIT_PASSWORD" \
 -A "hermes-agent/1.0 by $REDDIT_USERNAME" \
 https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")
```

Do not print `$REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` or the token; read them from env only.

### Submitting a post

```bash
# Self/text post
curl -s -X POST "https://oauth.reddit.com/api/submit" \
 -H "Authorization: bearer $TOKEN" \
 -A "hermes-agent/1.0 by $REDDIT_USERNAME" \
 -d "api_type=json&sr=<subreddit>&title=<URL-encoded title>&kind=self&text=<URL-encoded body>&resubmit=false"

# Link post
curl -s -X POST "https://oauth.reddit.com/api/submit" \
 -H "Authorization: bearer $TOKEN" \
 -A "hermes-agent/1.0 by $REDDIT_USERNAME" \
 -d "api_type=json&sr=<subreddit>&title=<URL-encoded title>&kind=link&url=<URL-encoded URL>&resubmit=false"

# With a flair (if the sub requires one — check rules first)
# -d "flair_id=<flair_template_id>"
```

The response is JSON: `{"json": {"errors": []}}` on success (empty errors), with `json.data.url` pointing at the live post.

### Verifying a post

- Fetch the returned URL (or `https://www.reddit.com/comments/<id>.json`) and confirm the title/body render.
- Report the final URL to the user.
- If `errors` is non-empty, read the error strings (e.g. `RATELIMIT`, `NO_TEXT`, `SUBREDDIT_NOTALLOWED`), fix, and retry only after the user re-approves.

## Browser-session option (no API app)

If the user does not want an OAuth app, they can log into Reddit in the Hermes browser once:

1. Have the user log in through the browser (agent never sees the password).
2. The agent uses that logged-in session: navigate to the target subreddit's submit page, fill title/body (or flair selector), and show the user a full-screen draft for approval.
3. The user clicks Submit themselves — or explicitly tells the agent to click it.
4. Verify the post exists by fetching its URL afterwards.

Browser sessions do not persist across restarts; the user may need to log in again.

## Workflow summary

1. Understand the goal — find the right subreddit and read its rules.
2. Read existing threads to check for duplicates and learn the format.
3. Draft the post (title + body, markdown) and show it to the user.
4. Get explicit approval: exact subreddit, title, body, flair.
5. Submit via OAuth or browser; never via unauthenticated endpoints.
6. Verify the live post and report the URL.

## Pitfalls

- Reddit blocks default User-Agents; always set a custom one — but note that a 403 **HTML block page** (the `theme-beta` page) can still appear from some networks regardless of UA; that is IP-level anti-bot blocking, not a request bug. Switch to the OAuth or browser path rather than retrying endlessly.
- `api_type=json` is required or the error format is unparseable.
- New accounts and accounts with low karma may hit `RATELIMIT` or shadow-removal; if a post 404s right after success, it was likely removed — report it honestly rather than claiming success.
- Link posts to the same URL repeatedly are blocked (`resubmit=false` helps only for edits).
- Do not store tokens in skill files, memory, or chat — only in env.
