# Bedrock AgentCore Operational Review

Use this skill when performing an operational review of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore resources, investigating agent runtime failures, auditing memory/knowledge pipeline health, or reviewing gateway resilience and resource hygiene.

## Overview

This skill provides procedures for a review of AgentCore resources across four check areas mapped to the AWS Well-Architected Framework:

- **Runtime Resilience** (Reliability) — Failed/stuck runtimes and endpoints, single-AZ VPC placement, endpoint version drift, DEFAULT-endpoint-only deployments
- **Gateway Health** (Reliability) — Gateway status, target redundancy and health, policy engine attachment, target synchronization freshness
- **Memory & Knowledge Effectiveness** (Performance Efficiency) — Extraction pipeline errors, empty long-term memory, high ingestion error rate, provisioned-but-never-populated memories
- **Resource Utilization & Operational Hygiene** (Operational Excellence) — Idle resources, consolidation opportunities, low overall utilization
- **Runtime Observability** (cross-pillar) — Session counts, invocations, throttles, vCPU-hours, GB-hours per runtime

This is a **READ-ONLY** review. No modifications are made to any resource, and it never invokes an agent (`InvokeAgentRuntime`), reads no prompts or responses, and makes no other data-plane calls. **One exception:** for long-term memories the skill calls `bedrock-agentcore:ListMemoryRecords` (a data-plane API) solely to obtain a **record count**. That response can include a `content` field carrying extracted, potentially PII-bearing memory content; the skill uses **only the count** and never parses, logs, stores, or reproduces `content`. See "Memory record data handling" below.

## Data Source Boundaries (IMPORTANT — IAM footprint)

The standard `AIDevOpsAgentAccessPolicy` covers `bedrock:*` read actions but does **NOT** include the `bedrock-agentcore:*` namespace. (Note: `bedrock-agentcore-control` is the SDK client name, not an IAM prefix — all control-plane actions such as `ListAgentRuntimes`, `GetMemory`, and `ListGateways` authorize under the single service prefix `bedrock-agentcore:`.) Two modes:

1. **Runtime-observability-only mode** — relies exclusively on CloudWatch metrics (`cloudwatch:GetMetricData`, `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`) against namespace `AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore`. Requires no `bedrock-agentcore:` additions. When an account isn't using AgentCore, the namespace is simply empty ("no activity detected") — this is not a failure.
2. **Full control-plane mode** — adds read-only `bedrock-agentcore:` control-plane List/Get actions and `ec2:DescribeSubnets` to enable the runtime/gateway/memory/utilization checks. It also uses one **data-plane** action, `bedrock-agentcore:ListMemoryRecords`, for the long-term-memory record count only (see "Memory record data handling" below). See `references/iam-policy-linked-account.json`.

If a required permission is missing, the affected check degrades to a **visibility limit** (reported as "signal unavailable / check skipped") rather than failing the review or producing a false finding.

**Memory record data handling:** `bedrock-agentcore:ListMemoryRecords` is a data-plane API whose `MemoryRecordSummary` entries include a required `content` field — the extracted facts/preferences/summaries a long-term memory has stored, which can contain end-user PII. This skill calls it **only** to count records for AC-MEM-2 and never reads, parses, logs, stores, transforms, or reproduces the `content` field. If you prefer zero data-plane access, omit this action from the IAM policy: AC-MEM-2 then degrades to a visibility limit while all other memory checks (which use CloudWatch ingestion metrics) continue to work.

**Seam with `agentcore-observability-setup`:** This skill assesses operational posture from *existing* telemetry; it does not configure or validate observability wiring. Where telemetry is absent, this skill reports a visibility limit and defers the configuration gap to `agentcore-observability-setup` — that skill owns the observability-wiring finding (Transaction Search, OTEL/ADOT, log delivery, X-Ray resource policy), while this skill reports only the posture consequence. A customer running both should not see two overlapping findings on the same resource.

## Step 1: Discover Account and Regions

1. Call `sts:GetCallerIdentity` to determine the account.
2. Discover AgentCore-active regions:
   - Query Cost Explorer: `ce:GetDimensionValues` (dimension SERVICE, last 30 days), match "Amazon Bedrock AgentCore".
   - Then `ce:GetCostAndUsage` for that service grouped by REGION; select top regions by UnblendedCost.
   - If no AgentCore spend is found, fall back to probing `cloudwatch:ListMetrics` (namespace `AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore`) in the customer's primary regions to detect activity.
3. If no AgentCore activity is detected in any region, stop: "No AgentCore usage detected in the last 30 days."

## Step 2: Runtime Resilience Pillar (Reliability)

Discover runtimes and enrich each with endpoints and versions:
- `bedrock-agentcore:ListAgentRuntimes` → `GetAgentRuntime` (status, `failureReason`, `networkConfiguration`)
- `bedrock-agentcore:ListAgentRuntimeEndpoints` (status, `liveVersion`, `targetVersion`, name)
- `bedrock-agentcore:ListAgentRuntimeVersions` (to compute latest version + drift)
- `ec2:DescribeSubnets` (resolve VPC subnet IDs to AZs — endpoints carry NO AZ data)

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| AC-RUN-1 | Runtime/endpoint in `CREATE_FAILED`/`UPDATE_FAILED`, or stuck in `CREATING`/`UPDATING` > 1 hour | **Critical** |
| AC-RUN-2 | VPC-mode runtime whose subnets all resolve to a single AZ (PUBLIC mode exempt) | **High** |
| AC-RUN-3 | Live endpoint ≥ 3 versions behind latest runtime version | **Medium** |
| AC-RUN-4 | Actively-updated runtime (2+ versions) served only by the auto-updating DEFAULT endpoint | **Low** |

**Key fact:** Endpoints are a versioning/traffic-routing construct, not a redundancy mechanism. AZ fault tolerance is derived exclusively from the runtime's VPC subnet configuration. If `ec2:DescribeSubnets` is unavailable, AC-RUN-2 degrades to "AZ distribution unknown".

## Step 3: Gateway Health (Reliability)

Discover gateways and their targets:
- `bedrock-agentcore:ListGateways` → `GetGateway` (status, protocolType, authorizerType, `policyEngineConfiguration`)
- `bedrock-agentcore:ListGatewayTargets` → `GetGatewayTarget` (status, `targetConfiguration`, `lastSynchronizedAt`, credential providers)

Target type derived from `targetConfiguration.mcp`: Lambda, MCP Server, API Gateway, OpenAPI Schema, Smithy Model.

| Risk Level | Condition |
|------------|-----------|
| **Critical** | Gateway not `READY`, zero targets, OR all targets unhealthy |
| **Warning** | Single target (no redundancy), no policy engine attached, some unhealthy targets, OR stale sync (> 7 days) |
| **Healthy** | Multiple READY targets, policy engine attached, recent synchronization |

Unhealthy target statuses: `FAILED`, `UPDATE_UNSUCCESSFUL`, `SYNCHRONIZE_UNSUCCESSFUL`. Stale sync threshold: `lastSynchronizedAt` older than 7 days.

## Step 4: Memory & Knowledge Effectiveness (Performance Efficiency)

Discover memories and their strategies, then query CloudWatch ingestion metrics:
- `bedrock-agentcore:ListMemories` → `GetMemory` (status, createdAt, **configured strategies**)
- `bedrock-agentcore:ListMemoryRecords` — **data-plane call, count only** (long-term-strategy memories). Read the returned record *count*; do not read the `content` field (see "Memory record data handling")
- `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` (namespace `AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore`): per-memory `Invocations`/`Errors` for the `Ingestion` operation, and `Invocations` for the `CreateEvent` operation (30-day window)

**All rules are strategy-aware** — read `GetMemory` strategies first. Record-count rules apply ONLY to memories with a long-term strategy; short-term-only memories are never flagged as empty.

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| AC-MEM-1 | Long-term memory with CloudWatch ingestion `Errors > 0` | **High** |
| AC-MEM-2 | Long-term memory with < 10 records (escalates to High if 0 records AND > 7 days old) | **Medium→High** |
| AC-MEM-3 | Ingestion error rate > 20% (`Errors / Invocations`) | **High** |
| AC-MEM-4 | Provisioned but never populated: zero `CreateEvent` activity AND > 7 days old | **Medium** |

**Safety rule:** `CreateEvent` activity is queried for EVERY memory (short-term memories receive events too). When the CloudWatch signal is unreadable, event count is `None` (not 0), so AC-MEM-4 is skipped rather than firing a false "never populated" finding.

## Step 5: Resource Utilization & Operational Hygiene (Operational Excellence)

Enumerate all provisionable resource types and collect a 30-day activity signal:
- Inventory: `ListAgentRuntimes`, `ListMemories`, `ListGateways`, `ListBrowsers`, `ListCodeInterpreters`, `ListWorkloadIdentities`
- Activity: `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` (`Invocations`, `AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore`) keyed by per-type dimension (`AgentRuntimeId`, `MemoryId`, `GatewayId`)

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| AC-UTIL-1 | Idle resource: zero activity over 30-day window, > 7 days old | **Medium** |
| AC-UTIL-2 | Consolidation: duplicate configs in a region, OR regions holding resources with < 5% of total activity (3+ regions) | **Informational→Medium** |
| AC-UTIL-3 | Overall utilization < 60% (active / assessable, excluding recently-created) | **Informational** |

For the AC-UTIL-1 idle signal, prefer the real-time `ActiveSessionCount` gauge (a currently-running-sessions gauge, filterable by the `Service` dimension) where available; fall back to the cumulative `SessionCount` / `Invocations` counters over the 30-day window when `ActiveSessionCount` is not present.

**Framing:** AgentCore runtime billing is consumption-based — idle time is free. Frame findings as operational hygiene and security surface (unmanaged IAM roles, stale config), NOT wasted spend. Exception: memories holding stored long-term records DO accrue storage cost — call this out in the finding.

**Classification safety:** A resource is only classified **Idle** when its activity signal is complete for the full window. Types with no queryable per-resource metric (Browser, CodeInterpreter, WorkloadIdentity), and every resource when the CloudWatch call fails, are classified **Active (partial)** — never Idle. Resources younger than 7 days are **RecentlyCreated** and excluded from both idle flagging and the utilization ratio.

## Step 6: Runtime Observability (cross-pillar signals)

For each runtime, collect CloudWatch metrics from namespace `AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore`:

| Metric | Dimensions | Period | Statistic |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| CPUUsed-vCPUHours | Resource (ARN), Service=`AgentCore.Runtime`, Name | 3600s | Sum |
| MemoryUsed-GBHours | Resource (ARN), Service=`AgentCore.Runtime`, Name | 3600s | Sum |
| SessionCount | Resource (ARN), Operation=`InvokeAgentRuntime`, Name | 300s | Sum |
| Invocations | Resource (ARN), Operation=`InvokeAgentRuntime`, Name | 300s | Sum |
| Throttles | Resource (ARN), Operation=`InvokeAgentRuntime`, Name | 300s | Sum |

`SessionCount` is a cumulative counter of new sessions per period. Where a real-time view is needed, `ActiveSessionCount` is a gauge of currently-running sessions (filterable by the `Service` dimension).

Discover resources first via `cloudwatch:ListMetrics` (namespace `AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore`), extract unique `Resource` ARN + `Name` dimensions, then batch `GetMetricData` per resource.

Derived signals:
- **Throttle rate** = `Throttles / Invocations × 100`
- **Health status** = "Throttling Detected" when `Throttles > 0`, else "Healthy"
- Only report runtimes with any activity (CPU-hours, GB-hours, invocations, or session count > 0).

## Step 7: Additional Context

1. **Health Events**: `health:DescribeEvents` filtered for Bedrock/AgentCore service, last 14 days.
2. **Documentation**: Cross-reference findings against AgentCore best-practices docs for remediation links.

## Step 8: Produce Report and Recommendations

Produce an artifact with the structure defined in `references/report-template.md`.

For each finding with severity Warning/Medium or higher, create a recommendation with:
- Title: `[Check ID] [Check name] — [Resource identifier]`
- Summary: Current state, expected state, business/operational impact, remediation steps, and a TAM conversation starter.

## Related Skills / Boundaries

Boundaries are deliberate and non-overlapping:
- **`agentcore-observability-setup`** — sets up/validates observability *wiring*. This skill consumes that telemetry for posture assessment and defers observability-*configuration* gaps to it (see the seam described in Data Source Boundaries).
- **`agentcore-runtime-diag`** (queued submission — referenced for scope, not yet published) — reactive triage of a *single failing invocation*. This skill is proactive, estate-wide posture; it does not diagnose individual call failures or evaluate authorizer/credential correctness. Gateway checks here are redundancy/staleness/health only, not auth evaluation.
- **`aiml-access-diagnostics`** (published) — generic AI/ML AccessDenied chain via `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy`. Not overlapping — this skill makes no IAM-simulation calls.
- **`bedrock-adoption-readiness`** (published) — foundation-model workload readiness (IAM governance, ZDR, quotas, observability). Different resource surface — this skill reviews the AgentCore agent runtime / memory / gateway layer, not foundation-model inference.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| AccessDenied on `bedrock-agentcore:*` | Log as visibility limit "signal unavailable — check skipped", continue in observability-only mode |
| AccessDenied on `ec2:DescribeSubnets` | AC-RUN-2 degrades to "AZ distribution unknown" |
| CloudWatch returns no data | Report "no activity detected" for that resource; classify utilization as Active (partial), never Idle |
| No AgentCore usage anywhere | Stop early: "No AgentCore usage detected" |
| Throttled by AWS API | Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts) |
| Check raises an exception | Isolate the failure — degrade that check to a visibility limit and continue the others |

## Important Notes

- ALL API calls with pagination (NextToken) MUST be paginated to completion.
- Cost Explorer queries run against us-east-1 (global endpoint).
- Findings are only produced when the underlying signal is complete — incomplete signals become visibility limits, never false positives.
- Batch CloudWatch `GetMetricData` requests where possible.
- This is a READ-ONLY review — no modifications, and no data-plane calls other than `ListMemoryRecords` for record count (count only; `content` is never read).
