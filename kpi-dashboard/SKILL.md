# KPI Dashboard Builder

Expert KPI and performance dashboard design system that helps you define meaningful metrics, build actionable dashboards, track progress, and drive data-driven decision-making. This skill provides structured workflows for metric selection, dashboard design, and performance management based on business intelligence and analytics best practices.

What gets measured gets managed. This skill helps you cut through vanity metrics to identify KPIs that truly drive business outcomes, design dashboards that provide actionable insights, and build a culture of data-driven execution. Whether you're tracking company-wide OKRs or department-specific metrics, this provides the framework for performance excellence.

Built on business intelligence principles and dashboard design best practices, this skill combines metric definition, visualization strategy, and performance monitoring to turn data into action.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: KPI Selection & Definition
**Choose the right metrics that drive business outcomes**

1. **KPI Framework**
   - **Strategic KPIs**: Company-level goals (revenue, profit, market share)
   - **Operational KPIs**: Efficiency metrics (cost per unit, cycle time, uptime)
   - **Leading Indicators**: Predict future performance (pipeline, traffic, engagement)
   - **Lagging Indicators**: Measure results (revenue, customer count, profit)

2. **SMART KPI Criteria**
   Every KPI must be:
   - **Specific**: Clearly defined, no ambiguity
   - **Measurable**: Quantifiable with data
   - **Achievable**: Realistic targets based on resources
   - **Relevant**: Directly tied to business objectives
   - **Time-bound**: Defined measurement period

3. **KPI Selection Process**
   - Start with business objectives (what are we trying to achieve?)
   - Identify critical success factors (what must go right?)
   - Map KPIs to each success factor (what measures progress?)
   - Validate data availability (can we measure this?)
   - Prioritize (5-7 KPIs per dashboard max)

4. **KPI Documentation Template**
   For each KPI, document:
   - **Name**: Clear, descriptive title

   - **Actionability**: Make next steps obvious
   - **Consistency**: Standard layout, colors, formats
   - **Freshness**: Real-time or clearly dated data

3. **Visualization Selection**
   - **Numbers/KPIs**: Big number with trend arrow
     - Use for: Revenue, user count, conversion rate
   - **Line Charts**: Trends over time
     - Use for: Revenue growth, traffic trends, retention curves
   - **Bar Charts**: Comparisons between categories
     - Use for: Sales by region, channel performance

     - Use for: Usage by day/hour, cohort retention

4. **Dashboard Layout Best Practices**
   - **Top-left**: Most important metric (eye starts here)
   - **Top-row**: Primary KPIs (the "story")
   - **Middle**: Supporting metrics and trends
   - **Bottom**: Detailed breakdowns and tables
   - **Right sidebar**: Filters, date range, definitions
   - Use white space (don't cram everything)
   - Limit to 7-10 visualizations per dashboard
   - Group related metrics together

5. **Color Strategy**
   - **Green**: Positive, on track, good
   - **Red**: Negative, off track, alert
   - **Yellow/Orange**: Warning, attention needed
   - **Gray**: Neutral, benchmark, comparison
   - Use color consistently across all dashboards
   - Ensure accessibility (color-blind friendly)

### Workflow 4: KPI Tracking & Monitoring
**Establish rhythms for reviewing and acting on metrics**

1. **Data Collection & Automation**
   - Automate data pipelines (minimize manual entry)
   - Integrate source systems (CRM, analytics, finance)
   - Schedule data refreshes (daily, hourly, real-time)
   - Validate data quality (accuracy checks, anomaly detection)
   - Document data lineage (where numbers come from)

2. **Review Cadence**
   - **Daily Standup** (5-10 min):
     - Check operational metrics (sales, traffic, incidents)
     - Flag anomalies or blockers
     - Quick wins and urgent issues

   - **Weekly Business Review** (30-60 min):
     - Review key KPIs vs. targets
     - Analyze trends and drivers
     - Identify actions needed
     - Assign owners and deadlines

     - Deep-dive on KPI performance
     - Variance analysis (actual vs. plan)
     - Forecast updates
     - Strategic discussions

   - **Quarterly Business Review** (half-day):
     - Review OKR progress
     - Strategic pivots if needed
     - Set next quarter goals
     - Cross-functional alignment

3. **Alert & Notification Strategy**
   - Set thresholds for critical KPIs
   - Automate alerts (email, Slack, SMS)
   - Escalate based on severity
   - Avoid alert fatigue (tune thresholds)

4. **Variance Analysis**
   When a KPI misses target:
   - **Quantify the gap**: How far off are we?
   - **Diagnose root causes**: Why did this happen?
     - Market conditions changed?
     - Execution issues?
     - Bad assumptions in target?
   - **Develop action plan**: What will we do?
   - **Assign ownership**: Who drives the fix?
   - **Set timeline**: When will we see improvement?

### Workflow 5: Performance Management & Optimization
**Use KPIs to drive continuous improvement**

1. **Goal Setting**
   - Set stretch but achievable targets
   - Use historical data + growth ambitions
   - Benchmark against industry standards
   - Align individual goals to company KPIs
   - Document assumptions behind targets

2. **OKR Integration**
   - Map KPIs to Objectives and Key Results
   - **Objective**: Qualitative goal (e.g., "Become market leader")
   - **Key Results**: Quantitative KPIs (e.g., "Achieve 25% market share")
   - Review OKRs quarterly, update KPIs as needed

3. **KPI Refinement**
   - Quarterly review: Are these the right KPIs?
   - Remove vanity metrics (look good but don't drive action)
   - Add leading indicators for predictive power
   - Simplify complex calculations if not understood
   - Archive outdated KPIs

4. **Data-Driven Culture**
   - Make dashboards visible (TV screens, Slack bots)
   - Celebrate wins when KPIs hit targets
   - Share insights widely (democratize data)
   - Train team on how to read dashboards
   - Reward data-driven decision making

5. **A/B Testing & Experimentation**
   - Use KPIs to measure experiment impact
   - Set success criteria upfront
   - Track both primary and secondary metrics
   - Document learnings (wins and failures)
   - Scale what works, kill what doesn't

## Best Practices

### KPI Selection
- **Less is more**: 5-7 KPIs per dashboard (focus, not overwhelm)
- **Balance**: Mix leading and lagging indicators
- **Actionable**: Only track what you can influence
- **Avoid vanity**: Page views don't matter if revenue doesn't follow
- **Segment appropriately**: Different dashboards for different audiences

### Data Quality
- Single source of truth for each metric (avoid conflicting numbers)
- Automate data collection (reduce errors)
- Validate calculations regularly
- Document definitions clearly (eliminate ambiguity)
- Version control (track changes to KPI formulas)

### Dashboard Design
- **Keep it simple**: One glance should tell the story
- **Prioritize**: Most important metrics at top-left
- **Context matters**: Show trends, not just current values
- **Annotations**: Explain anomalies and context (product launch, holiday)
- **Mobile-friendly**: Ensure readability on phones/tablets

### Review Discipline
- Schedule recurring review meetings (don't skip)
- Come prepared (review data before meeting)
- Focus on action (not just discussion)
- Document decisions and owners
- Follow up on prior commitments

### Performance Management
- Tie compensation to KPI achievement (align incentives)
- Celebrate wins publicly
- Analyze failures without blame (learn and improve)
- Adjust targets if assumptions change
- Sunset KPIs that no longer matter

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Metric overload**: Tracking 50 KPIs (can't focus on anything)
- **Vanity metrics**: Tracking metrics that make you feel good but don't matter
- **Wrong attribution**: Claiming credit for results you didn't influence
- **Gaming metrics**: Optimizing for the metric, not the outcome
- **Stale data**: Dashboards that aren't updated regularly
- **No context**: Showing numbers without trends or comparisons
- **Analysis paralysis**: Endless discussion, no action
- **Set and forget**: Not revisiting whether KPIs still matter
