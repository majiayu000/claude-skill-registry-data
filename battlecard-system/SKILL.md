# Battlecard System Skill

## When to Use
- Launching new competitive programs or product updates.
- Training teams ahead of major deals or campaigns.
- Refreshing differentiators based on win/loss analysis.

## Framework
1. **Competitive Intel** – capture strengths, weaknesses, proof, and trigger signals per competitor.
2. **Messaging Pillars** – align headline, supporting proof, and objection responses.
3. **Delivery Format** – deck, one-pager, LMS module, and short-form scripts.
4. **Distribution & Access** – tag assets, set expiration dates, and embed in enablement tools.
5. **Feedback Loop** – collect field feedback, update win/loss data, and refresh quarterly.

## Templates
- Battlecard layout (overview, talk track, objections, proof points).
- Objection handling matrix.
- Competitive win/loss capture form.

## Tips
- Keep “permission to win” statements crisp; avoid feature dumping.
- Include audio/video snippets from top performers.
- Align with legal/product teams before publishing sensitive data.
