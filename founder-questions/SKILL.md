# Founder Questions Generator

Create interview questions that extract authentic, emotional content from founders. Stories are 22x more memorable than facts alone.

## Why Founder Ads Work

- **Uncopyable**: Competitors cannot replicate your founder
- **AI-proof**: AI cannot fake authentic founder presence (yet)
- **Long-lasting**: Founder ads run for years without burnout (vs 2 weeks for UGC)
- **High trust**: We evolved to trust faces before brands, before we could read
- **Social proof without telling**: Shows the founder putting their name on the line

- What almost made you quit?
- What kept you going when things got hard?

**CUSTOMER SURPRISES (10-15 questions)**

- What makes you angry about how others treat customers?
- What's your brand NOT?

- What do customers deserve that they're not getting?

**PRODUCT DEEP-DIVE (10-15 questions)**

**LIFE FORCE 8 HOOKS (designed to hit core desires)**

- What do people say about feeling safe/secure?
- How does this make people feel more attractive?
- What comfort does this bring to their daily life?
- How does this help people be better parents/partners?

### Step 3: Add Follow-Up Prompts

Use these to dig deeper after any answer:
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "What happened next?"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "Take me back to that moment..."
- "What were you thinking when that happened?"
- "What did they actually say, in their words?"

### Step 4: The Stories > Statements Principle

Stories are 22x more memorable than facts alone. Train founders to speak in stories, not claims.

| Instead of (Statement) | Get them to say (Story) |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| "The clothes are comfortable" | "I can get on the floor with my kids in this" |
| "Customers love it" | "One customer told me they wear my pants to get a job or get laid" |
| "It's high quality" | "I read every review and one customer's mom wore our necklace every day until she passed, now her daughter wears it" |
| "It works" | "Christie messaged me and said her mom wore her initial necklace every single day..." |

**Question to elicit stories:**
- "Tell me about a specific customer, what was their name, what happened?"
- "Walk me through exactly what happened that day..."
- "What did they actually say to you?"

### Step 5: Organize by Funnel Stage

**TOP (Awareness)**: Origin story, industry frustrations, emotional hooks
**MIDDLE (Consideration)**: Product deep-dive, customer surprises, how it works
**BOTTOM (Decision)**: Objection handling, trust questions, guarantees, risk reversal

### Step 6: Output Question Bank

```
## FOUNDER QUESTIONS: [Brand Name]
Generated: [Date]

### INTERVIEW SETUP

**Equipment (Minimal)**
- iPhone (relatively new, looks native to platform)
- External mic (essential - audio quality matters)
- Ring light (if lighting isn't great)
- Total cost: Basically nothing

**Location Options**
- Product warehouse (adds massive authority)
- Production facility
- Founder's home with product visible
- Office with interesting background
- Dental office in scrubs (for dentists)
- Hemp field (for hemp products)
- Avoid: Plain white backgrounds

**Clothing**
- Interesting, not plain
- Relatively solid colors
- Something memorable (Kamal wears a bold jumper with a lighthouse)
- Avoid: Generic business attire

**Duration**: 1-2 hours (yields hundreds of clips)
**Prep**: DON'T share questions in advance

### GOLDEN QUESTIONS (Start here)
1. What's the most surprising thing a customer ever told you?
2. What's your industry's biggest lie?
3. What moment made you cry (happy or sad)?
4. Why should someone trust you over alternatives?
5. What's the craziest compliment you've ever received?

### POST-INTERVIEW CLIPS TO CAPTURE

- Founder reading a real customer review (first time seeing it)
- Founder responding to a negative review live
- Warehouse/production walkthrough
- Founder holding/using product naturally
- Phone call with actual customer (record the call)

- Behind-the-scenes of how product is made
```

## Interview Execution Tips (Kamal FounderAds)

### The Golden Rules
1. **NEVER give them a script** - They'll talk like their website
2. **NEVER share questions in advance** - Authentic reactions only
3. **Ask questions they haven't prepared for** - Catch them off guard
4. **Wait through awkward silences** - Gold comes AFTER the pause
5. **Stories > Statements** - 22x more memorable
6. **Capture the pain in their eyes** - Authenticity is visible

### What Goes Wrong
- Giving founders scripts (they freeze up)
- Expensive studios (makes them stiff)
- Formal clothing (uncomfortable = unnatural)
- Sharing questions beforehand (rehearsed = fake)
- Expecting every answer to be good (you need volume)

### What Works
- Casual conversation format
- Interesting backgrounds, not sterile
- 100 questions in 1-2 hours
- Following up with "tell me more"
- Letting them ramble (edit later)
- Mining for that ONE golden moment

## Post-Interview Processing

### Traditional Method
After shoot, organize Google Drive folders:
- Clips labeled with timestamps
- Organized by question category
- Makes editing 10x faster

### AI-Assisted Method (Claude)
1. Get full 1-2 hour shoot transcribed with timestamps
2. Feed transcript to Claude project trained on your ad system
3. Prompt: "Using ONLY exact language from this transcript, create a script my editor can cut"
4. Claude identifies best clips and assembles them

## Volume and Testing

From 1-2 hour shoot you get:
- ~100 clips total
- ~20 potential hooks
- ~30 social proof moments
- ~10 narrative segments

These can be remixed into dozens of ad variations:
- Hook + Body + CTA combinations
- Different hooks, same body
- Same hook, different angles
- Funnel-specific versions

## Why Founder Ads Don't Burn Out

UGC burns out in ~2 weeks. Founder ads run for YEARS because:
- Authenticity doesn't expire
- Trust compounds over time
- Story stays relevant
- No "I've seen this creator before" fatigue
- Creates parasocial relationship with brand

## When Founder Doesn't Match ICP

Options if founder doesn't look like the customer:
- Head of Product can substitute
- Customer service lead (very authentic)
- Founder's girlfriend/partner (if matches demo)
- Focus on voice-over with B-roll if needed

Note: Kamal has seen male founders selling to young women with top-spending founder ads. Authenticity can overcome demographic mismatch.

## Bonus: AI Podcast Ads Format

Single person talking (not back-and-forth conversation):
- Generate a picture of a person at a mic
- Run through Google VE or similar
- Have them answer your angle
- Works exceptionally well right now
