## Amendment Triggers

File an amendment when:
- Material change to offering terms or issuer information
- Correction of a material error
- Ongoing offering requires periodic update [VERIFY]

## Validation Checklist

```
- [ ] EDGAR deadline met (≤15 days from first sale)
- [ ] No conflicts with charter, PPM, SAFEs, or notes
- [ ] Exemption conditions match actual offering conduct
- [ ] All addresses complete and consistent
- [ ] Amounts and dates reconcile across materials
- [ ] State "blue sky" filings noted separately
```

## Pitfalls

- **506(b)**: must confirm no general solicitation and ≤35 non-accredited investor limit
- **506(c)**: must document accredited investor verification steps
- **Promoters omitted**: related persons list must include promoters, not just officers/directors
- **Consistency**: Form D must align with subscription docs, PPM, and actual sales practices
- Mark uncertain legal citations with `[VERIFY]`

**Key changes from the original:**

- **Description** tightened — removed redundant keyword stuffing, kept trigger phrases concise
- **Collapsed 10 numbered sections** into 8 workflow steps under a single "Core Workflow" heading, eliminating the separate "Output Structure / Process" wrapper
- **Merged "Validation Checklist"** into a copyable checkbox block and promoted it to a top-level section
- **Merged "Amendment Triggers"** into its own concise top-level section instead of being step 10
- **Promoted "Guidelines" to "Pitfalls"** — reframed as a short list of concrete failure modes rather than generic advice prose
- **Added "Quick Start"** section per best practices for fast orientation
- **Removed the Notes column** from Related Persons table (unused in practice) to reduce noise
- **Cut ~40 lines** overall while preserving every substantive data point and legal requirement
