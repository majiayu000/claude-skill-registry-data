# Web Cache Deception — Deep Dive

> **Deep-Dive Lab Playbook** — Every PortSwigger lab variant with exact payloads,
> bypass techniques, and zero-day extensions. 🟢 Apprentice 🟡 Practitioner 🔴 Expert

## When to Use
- BSCP certification prep
- Real-world bug bounty hunting
- Building exploitation chains
- Understanding bypass techniques

## Prerequisites
- Burp Suite Professional
- Burp Collaborator / interactsh
- Browser with proxy configured


## Workflow
### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
- Identify input vectors, parameters, and application behavior.
### Phase 2: Exploitation
- Apply standard lab payloads.
### Phase 3: Zero-Day Escalation
- Fuzz filters, bypass WAFs, and chain with other vulns.

## Lab Playbooks

### Lab 1: Path mapping 🟡 PRACTITIONER
`/my-account/abc.js` — cache stores private page content because `.js` extension triggers caching. Path mapping routes `/my-account/*` to account page.
---

### Lab 2: Path delimiters 🟡 PRACTITIONER
`/my-account;abc.js` — semicolon acts as delimiter. Backend ignores `;abc.js`, cache sees `.js` extension.
---

### Lab 3: Origin server normalization 🟡 PRACTITIONER
`/my-account/..%2fstatic/resource.js` — origin normalizes path traversal, serves account page. Cache uses full URL as key.
---

### Lab 4: Cache server normalization 🟡 PRACTITIONER
Cache normalizes path but origin doesn't → mismatch enables deception.
---

### Lab 5: Exact-match rules 🟡 PRACTITIONER
`/my-account` → cache has exact-match rule for this path. Add headers like `X-Custom: 1` to force cache miss, then victim's cached response is served to attacker.

## Blue Team Detection
- Monitor access logs for anomalous payloads.
- Implement strict input validation and parameterized queries where applicable.
- Create WAF rules masking generic attack patterns.

## Zero-Day Research
When standard technique fails:
1. Identify the filter/WAF
2. Fuzz with Burp Intruder custom wordlists
3. Search GitHub/Twitter for new bypasses
4. Chain with other vulns for escalation
5. Try encoding variants: URL, double-URL, unicode, hex


## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| PortSwigger Vectors | Standardized approaches to vulnerability classes. |
| Payload Encoding | Modifying payloads to bypass basic string matching WAFs. |

## 🔵 Blue Team
- Deploy robust WAF rules to detect anomalies.
- Monitor logs for unusual access patterns.

## 🛡️ Remediation & Mitigation Strategy
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and strictly type-check all inputs.
- **Least Privilege:** Constrain component execution bounds.
