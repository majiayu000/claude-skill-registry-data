# Policy Document Writer

## When to Use

- When creating a new corporate policy or procedure
- When formalizing informal processes into official SOPs
- When audit findings require documented policies
- When regulatory requirements demand written procedures

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Document Control Header

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Document ID** | POL-[Department]-[NNN] |
| **Title** | [Clear, specific title] |
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Effective Date** | [Date] |
| **Review Date** | [12 months from effective] |
| **Owner** | [Role/Name] |
| **Approver** | [Role/Name] |
| **Classification** | Internal / Confidential / Public |

### Step 2 — Purpose & Scope

**Purpose:** One paragraph explaining:
- WHY this policy exists
- WHAT problem it addresses
- WHAT compliance requirement it satisfies (if any)

**Scope:**
- Who this applies to (roles, departments, locations)
- What it covers (and explicitly what it does NOT cover)
- When it takes effect

### Step 3 — Definitions

Define key terms to avoid ambiguity:

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| PII | Personally Identifiable Information — any data that can identify an individual |
| Data Controller | Entity that determines purposes and means of processing personal data |

### Step 4 — Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| Policy Owner | Maintains, reviews, updates the policy |
| Department Heads | Ensures team compliance, reports violations |
| All Employees | Reads, understands, follows the policy |
| Compliance Team | Monitors adherence, conducts audits |

### Step 5 — Policy Statements

Write clear, enforceable statements:

**Good:**
> All employees must complete security awareness training within 30 days of hire and annually thereafter.

**Bad:**
> ~~Employees should try to complete training when possible.~~

Rules for policy statements:
- Use "must" for requirements, "should" for recommendations
- Be specific about timeframes, quantities, and thresholds
- Include consequences for non-compliance
- Reference related policies by ID

### Step 6 — Procedures (SOP)

For each procedure, document step-by-step:

| Step | Action | Responsible | System | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Receive request via [channel] | [Role] | [System] | — |
| 2 | Verify requester identity | [Role] | [System] | Check against directory |
| 3 | Assess request against policy | [Role] | [Checklist] | Use form X-123 |
| 4 | Approve or deny with reason | [Role] | [System] | Document decision |

Include decision trees for complex procedures:
- If [condition A] → follow path 1
- If [condition B] → escalate to [role]

### Step 7 — Compliance & Monitoring

| Check | Method | Frequency | Responsible |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Training completion | LMS report | Monthly | HR |
| Policy acknowledgment | e-signature | Annual | Compliance |
| Incident review | Audit log | Quarterly | Security |

### Step 8 — Review Schedule

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Annual review date | Full review by policy owner |
| Regulatory change | Impact assessment within 30 days |
| Significant incident | Review and update within 15 days |
| Organizational change | Review scope and applicability |

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Format |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Policy topic | Yes | What the policy covers |
| Regulatory requirements | Recommended | Applicable laws/standards |
| Existing informal processes | Recommended | Current practices to formalize |
| Approval authority | Yes | Who approves the policy |

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Document control header complete
- [ ] Purpose and scope clearly defined
- [ ] Key terms defined to avoid ambiguity
- [ ] Roles and responsibilities assigned
- [ ] Policy statements use "must" language
- [ ] Procedures are step-by-step with responsible roles
- [ ] Compliance monitoring plan included
- [ ] Review schedule and change log present

## Quality Criteria

- [ ] All placeholder sections are filled with domain-specific content
- [ ] Structure follows the relevant industry standard or framework
- [ ] Language matches target audience (technical / executive / legal)
- [ ] Output is ready for review — not a rough draft requiring major rework

## Verification (4C)

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Does the draft structure follow the stated framework or industry standard? |
| **Completeness** | Are all required sections present with substantive (not placeholder) content? |
| **Context-fit** | Does tone, detail level, and terminology match the intended audience? |
| **Consequence** | If sent to the intended recipient without further editing, what would fail? |

## Edge Cases

- **No existing template for this type** — Use the closest available template and document all customizations made.
- **Stakeholder requirements conflict** — Flag conflicts explicitly in the draft. Do not silently choose one requirement over another.
- **Output required in multiple formats** — Produce the canonical format first, then derive others. Note any formatting limitations.
