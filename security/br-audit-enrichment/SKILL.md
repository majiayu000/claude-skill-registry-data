# Better Route audit enrichment

Run authentication first, enrichment second, and audit logging around the downstream handler.

```php
use BetterRoute\Middleware\Audit\AuditEnricherMiddleware;
use BetterRoute\Middleware\Audit\AuditMiddleware;

$router->middleware([
    $auth,
    new AuditEnricherMiddleware(
        staticFields: ['resource' => 'account', 'action' => 'update'],
        clientIpResolver: $trustedProxyResolver,
        includeClientIp: true
    ),
    new AuditMiddleware($logger),
]);
```

`AuditEnricherMiddleware` writes to the context `audit` attribute. It copies the normalized authentication provider, user ID, and subject; hashes an `Idempotency-Key` with SHA-1 for correlation; optionally resolves client IP; and merges reviewed static fields. Existing fields are retained, while later enrichment values with the same name win.

`AuditMiddleware` logs success or error with route, method, status, duration, correlation metadata, and enrichment. Logger exceptions are swallowed deliberately: observability is best-effort and must not change a successful response or mask the application exception already in flight.

## Rules

- Never include bearer tokens, cookies, nonces, application passwords, HMAC secrets/signatures, payment data, full bodies, or raw idempotency keys.
- Treat SHA-1 here only as a non-secret correlation fingerprint, not as a security proof.
- Use a trusted-proxy-aware resolver before recording or acting on forwarded client IPs.
- Keep static values bounded and public-safe. Do not pass attacker-controlled payload arrays as static fields.
- Protect the log sink with access control, retention limits, rotation, and output escaping in viewers.
- Alert separately when the logging backend is unavailable; the request path intentionally will not fail.

Test successful responses, `ApiException`, unexpected exceptions, logger failure, missing authentication context, and spoofed forwarded headers.
