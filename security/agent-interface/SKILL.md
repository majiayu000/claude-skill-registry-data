# Agent Interface Skill

Guren derives agent tools from the contracts a route already carries — its schemas, its model bindings, its authorization. Nothing is written twice: **there is no tool class and no second JSON schema to hand-write.** Your whole job is deciding which routes to expose and making sure the contracts they already have are complete.

## Exposing a route

Declare `agent` metadata on the route. Either form works:

```typescript
import { Router } from '@guren/core'

router.post('/posts', {
  name: 'posts.store',
  body: CreatePostSchema,
  output: PostOutputSchema,
  agent: { description: 'Create a blog post as the authenticated user.' },
}, [PostController, 'store'])

router
  .post('/posts', { body: CreatePostSchema }, [PostController, 'store'])
  .name('posts.store')
  .agent({ description: 'Create a blog post as the authenticated user.' })
```

**Argument order trap:** the options object is the **second** argument and the handler is the **last** — `router.post(path, options, handler)`. Writing `router.post(path, handler, options)` registers the options object as the handler. The router recognizes an options object by its keys, `agent` included, so an object carrying only `agent` is still options and not a handler.

**One declaration per route.** Declaring `agent` in the route options *and* chaining `.agent()` throws at registration ("already carries agent metadata"). It is a refusal rather than a merge on purpose: a silent overwrite would drop security-relevant fields (`approval`, `redact`) the first declaration carried.

The tool name is the route name, used verbatim — the MCP name grammar allows dots, so `posts.store` is a legal tool name. Not every client accepts one: the Claude and OpenAI tool APIs restrict names to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`, and Claude Managed Agents applies that grammar to MCP tools and *silently skips* every tool outside it. Give such a route a portable spelling with `agent: { toolName: 'posts_store' }` (route name, `route()` helpers and path stay unchanged); `guren check` warns (`agent-route-portable-name`) on a name a client would drop. **A route with no `.name()` cannot be a tool** (the name is the tool's identity); `guren check` fails on it.

## Exposing resource() actions

`resource()` takes per-action metadata, and an action not listed is **not exposed**:

```typescript
router.resource('/posts', PostController, {
  agent: {
    index: { description: 'List posts.' },
    store: { description: 'Create a post.' },
    // show/update/destroy are registered as routes but are not agent tools
  },
})
```

Deny by default is the point: never spread one metadata object across every action to "save typing". Auto-converting every endpoint into a tool is the known anti-pattern — it produces oversized catalogs that degrade the agents reading them. Expose the few routes an agent actually needs.

Declaring metadata for an action that was not registered (excluded via `only`/`except`, or missing from the controller) throws — a tool that cannot exist is a wiring mistake.

## Metadata fields

Everything below is **declared metadata** on the route — there is still no tool definition to write. The metadata is read by `guren check`, `guren audit` and `guren context <Entity>`, and it is honoured at runtime by `@guren/plugin-mcp`, which serves the derived tools at `/mcp`: the annotation defaults are resolved during derivation, `expose.mcp` filters the served catalog, `redact` masks arguments in the audit events, and `approval: 'required'` fails closed. Two things in this table still describe surfaces that have not shipped, and both rows say so: `expose.webMcp` and the approval *queue*.

Serving is a separate, app-level step: the endpoint mounts only when the app installs the plugin and configures a bearer token store. A route carries `.agent()` metadata whether or not it does — declaring it is your job, mounting the endpoint is the app's.

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `description` | What the tool does. Falls back to the route's OpenAPI `description` ?? `summary`. Write it for an agent that has never seen your app. |
| `toolName` | Overrides the route name as the tool name. |
| `expose` | `{ mcp?, webMcp? }` — which protocol surfaces the tool appears on; both default to true. `mcp: false` keeps a tool out of the MCP endpoint's catalog today. `webMcp` is recorded for a browser surface that has not shipped. |
| `readOnlyHint` | The tool changes nothing. On a mutating verb this is an explicit override — and it exempts the route from the authorization rule below, so `guren check` holds it against the action's body. |
| `destructiveHint` | `false` is the strong claim "additive updates only" — `guren audit` checks it against the action. Unset keeps the spec default (destructive for a non-read-only tool). |
| `idempotentHint` | Repeat calls with the same arguments add no effect. The derivation defaults it to true for PUT and DELETE; declaring it records your own claim. |
| `approval` | `'required'` marks the tool as needing server-side approval before it executes. There is no approval queue yet, so the MCP endpoint **fails closed** on it: the tool is neither listed nor callable. |
| `redact` | Argument field names to mask in the `AgentToolInvoked` / `AgentToolDenied` events the endpoint emits. Unioned with a built-in fragment list (`password`, `secret`, `token`, `apikey`, …), so it *adds* to a default rather than being the whole mask. Matching is lowercased, separator-stripped containment — `redact: ['id']` also masks `userId`. |

Annotations are untrusted hints for client UX. **They enforce nothing** — enforcement lives in your policies (evaluated inside the dispatched request, exactly as for a browser) and in the calling token's tool scopes (evaluated before the request is synthesized); the approval queue is still to come. That is exactly why the two hints that *weaken* a check are held against the controller body.

## Authentication is not authorization

An agent calls with a token, not a browser session. `this.auth.userOrFail()` proves *who* is calling; it does not decide whether that caller may perform *this* action. A non-read-only tool protected only by authentication hands every authenticated principal — every agent holding any token — the whole action.

So every non-read-only tool needs one of:

```typescript
// on the route
router.delete('/posts/:id', { name: 'posts.destroy', agent: {} }, [PostController, 'destroy'])
  .middleware(authorizeMiddleware('posts.destroy'))

// or in the action
await this.authorize('delete', [Post, post])
```

`this.can(...)` is not enough: it returns a boolean and enforces nothing. `guren check` **fails** a non-read-only agent route with neither.

Do not reach for `agent: { readOnlyHint: true }` to quiet that failure. Being read-only is what exempts a route from this rule, so `guren check` holds the claim against the action's body and warns when the action deletes, updates, or force-writes — for the GET/QUERY default just as much as for a hint you wrote. Declare it only when the tool truly changes nothing.

## Give the tool its schemas

A tool's input schema comes from the route's `params`, `query`, and `body`; its output schema from `output`, or a `resource` hint for the description. A route missing them still works over HTTP but leaves an agent guessing:

- No `body` schema on a body-carrying route → the agent cannot see what the action expects, and every call it composes is rejected by the validation inside the action. On an **inline handler** it is worse: there the route schema is what validates at request time, so nothing checks the payload either.
- No `output` schema and no `resource` hint → the result reaches the agent as untyped text. This applies to write tools as much as read tools.
- An action that returns `this.inertia(...)` → the tool returns whatever the page passes its component, a shape nothing checks and any UI change can move. Prefer `output` + `this.json(...)` for agent-facing routes.

## Check the wiring

```bash
bunx guren check    # agent-route rules run in the normal suite
bunx guren audit    # validation rules are stricter for agent-exposed routes
```

`guren check` **fails** on: a nameless agent route, a tool name outside `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,128}$`, two routes resolving to one tool name, and a non-read-only tool whose controller action shows no authorization. It **warns** on: a missing output or body schema, an Inertia response, a read-only tool whose action mutates (declared or GET/QUERY-default), a controller file it could not read, and any verdict it could not reach because the handler body was one it does not read (an inline handler, or a controller outside `app/Http/Controllers/`).

`guren audit` warns when `destructiveHint: false` sits on an action that deletes, updates, or force-writes records, and treats an unverifiable body validation on an agent route as a failure rather than a warning. Suppress an audit finding you have judged safe by its exact key in `config/audit.ts`.
