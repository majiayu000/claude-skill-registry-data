# Case Studies Skill

## When to Use
- Sales needs tailored proof points for a segment or persona.
- Marketing is launching a campaign that requires social proof.
- Customer success wants standardized win-story format.

## Framework
1. **Story Framework (CHIC)** – Challenge → Hypothesis → Implementation → Change (results).
2. **Data Gathering** – collect metrics (time saved, revenue lift), qualitative quotes, before/after workflows.
3. **Narrative Structure** – exec summary, customer background, stakes, solution, outcomes, CTA.
4. **Format Variations** – PDF, one-pager, slide deck, video script, micro social posts.
5. **Enablement Package** – key stats table, objection responses, industry tags.

## Templates
- Narrative brief outlining each CHIC section with quote/data placeholders.
- Multi-format layout kit (PDF, one-pager, slide deck) sharing headline + proof modules.
- Enablement bundle: stats table, objection matrix, industry filter tags.

## Tips
- Secure approvals early—share outlines with customers/legal before writing.
- Lead with outcomes; move background into sidebars to keep attention.
- Build a modular proof library so stats auto-populate future case studies.
- Produce derivative social tiles or short videos alongside the long-form asset.

## Checklist
- At least 2 hard metrics and 1 qualitative quote.
- Visual timeline or architecture diagram.
- CTA customized per campaign (demo, workshop, download).
- Approvals from customer + legal.
