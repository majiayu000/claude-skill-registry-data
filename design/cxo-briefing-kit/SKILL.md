# CXO Briefing Kit Skill

## When to Use
- Preparing executive sponsor briefings ahead of milestone meetings.
- Summarizing pursuit status for CRO, COO, CFO, or CEO stakeholders.
- Logging decisions, risks, and asks after executive reviews.

## Framework
1. **Audience Snapshot** – note executive priorities, role, and preferred format.
2. **Headline & Status** – articulate deal stage, confidence, and key wins/risks.
3. **Value Story** – highlight quantified impact + proof tied to executive objectives.
4. **Decision & Ask** – specify approvals, resources, or unblockers required.
5. **Action & Follow-up** – capture owners, due dates, and communication plan.

## Templates
- One-slide exec update (headline, metrics, risks, asks).
- Briefing memo outline with context, status, decisions, next steps.
- Decision log sheet with timestamp, owner, outcome.

## Tips
- Keep main slide under 150 words; push detail to appendix.
- Tailor numbers to executive KPIs (margin, risk, innovation, customer impact).
- Pair with `pursuit-governance` to keep cadences consistent.
