Daily Actions:
1. Find 5-10 larger accounts in your niche (data viz, Python, Spanish tech)
2. Reply with value: insights, helpful additions, thoughtful questions
3. NOT: "Great post!" or generic agreement
4. Aim for 50+ quality replies/day

Expected Results:
- 8K+ impressions/day
- Profile visits from larger audiences
- Algorithm recognition as active participant
```

## Target Metrics
| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Followers | X | Y |
| Avg impressions/post | X | Y |
| Newsletter signups | X | Y |

## Content Calendar

### Week 1
| Day | Content | Format | CTA |
|-----|---------|--------|-----|
| Mon | [Topic] | Thread | Follow |

```

## Metrics to Track

### Primary (Weekly)
- Follower growth rate (target: 2-5%/month)
- Avg impressions per post
- Engagement rate (likes + replies + RTs / impressions)
- Newsletter signups from X

### Secondary (Monthly)
- Profile visits
- Link clicks
- Reply rate trend
- Top performing content themes

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these common mistakes:

- **Posting and ghosting** — Must engage in first hour after posting
- **Same content everywhere** — Adapt for platform, don't cross-post verbatim
- **Hashtag stuffing** — Max 1-2, often zero is better
- **Link-only posts** — Always add compelling caption/insight
- **Ignoring replies** — Every reply is an opportunity
- **Inconsistent schedule** — Algorithm favors reliability
