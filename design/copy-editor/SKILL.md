# Copy Editor

A general-purpose copy editing skill that reviews and edits text for grammar, style, and clarity. Supports custom project style guides with a comprehensive default fallback.

## When to Use

- Reviewing marketing copy, landing pages, or ad text
- Editing blog posts, articles, or thought leadership pieces
- Polishing documentation or technical writing
- Improving email campaigns or newsletters
- Refining product descriptions or UI text
- Any business writing that needs professional polish

## Methodology

Follow these four phases sequentially for thorough copy review.

### Phase 1: Context Analysis

Before editing, understand the document:

1. **Document Type**: Marketing copy, blog post, documentation, email, etc.
2. **Target Audience**: Technical, general, executive, customer-facing
3. **Intended Tone**: Formal, conversational, persuasive, informative
4. **Purpose**: Inform, persuade, instruct, engage

Note these factors as they influence which style rules apply. Marketing copy allows more creative freedom than documentation.

### Phase 2: Style Guide Resolution

Locate the applicable style guide in this order:

1. **Project root**: Check for `STYLE_GUIDE.md`
2. **Claude directory**: Check for `.claude/style-guide.md`
3. **Docs folder**: Check for `docs/style-guide.md`
4. **Default fallback**: Use `references/DEFAULT_STYLE_GUIDE.md` from this skill

```bash
# Search for project style guide
glob "STYLE_GUIDE.md" || glob ".claude/style-guide.md" || glob "docs/style-guide.md"
```

If a project style guide exists, prioritize its rules. The default guide provides universal best practices for cases not covered.

### Phase 3: Line-by-Line Review

Systematically review the copy for:

**Grammar & Mechanics**
- Subject-verb agreement
- Punctuation (commas, semicolons, apostrophes)
- Capitalization consistency
- Number formatting
- Spelling and typos

**Voice & Clarity**
- Active vs. passive voice (prefer active)
- Sentence length and readability
- Jargon and unnecessary complexity
- Redundant words and phrases
- Parallel structure in lists

**Style Adherence**
- Consistency with style guide rules
- Tone appropriate for audience
- Brand voice alignment (if applicable)
- Formatting conventions

**Content Quality**
- Logical flow and transitions
- Clear headlines and subheadings
- Effective calls-to-action
- Accurate claims and statements

**AI Writing Tells** (see `references/AI_WRITING_TELLS.md`)
- Vocabulary clusters (delve, landscape, pivotal, robust, etc.)
- Formulaic phrases ("In today's...", "In conclusion...")
- Vague attributions ("some experts", "widely regarded")
- Structural patterns (mechanical balance, essay format)
- Sycophantic phrases ("I hope this helps")

### Phase 4: Structured Report

## Guiding Principles

1. **Quote exactly**: Always show the original text verbatim
2. **Cite rules**: Reference specific style guide rules when applicable
3. **Preserve voice**: Maintain the author's style while improving clarity
4. **Prioritize impact**: Focus on issues that affect comprehension first
5. **Be constructive**: Frame suggestions positively, explain the "why"
6. **Note ambiguity**: When rules conflict or are unclear, explain options
