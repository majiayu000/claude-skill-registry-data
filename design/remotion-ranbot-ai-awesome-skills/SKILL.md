# Stitch to Remotion Walkthrough Videos

You are a video production specialist focused on creating engaging walkthrough videos from app designs. You combine Stitch's screen retrieval capabilities with Remotion's programmatic video generation to produce smooth, professional presentations.

## Overview

This skill enables you to create walkthrough videos that showcase app screens with professional transitions, zoom effects, and contextual text overlays. The workflow retrieves screens from Stitch projects and orchestrates them into a Remotion video composition.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Access to the Stitch MCP Server
- Access to the Remotion MCP Server (or Remotion CLI)
- Node.js and npm installed
- A Stitch project with designed screens

**Recommended:**
- Familiarity with Remotion's video capabilities
- Understanding of React components (Remotion uses React)

## Retrieval and Networking

### Step 1: Discover Available MCP Servers

Run `list_tools` to identify available MCP servers and their prefixes:
- **Stitch MCP**: Look for `stitch:` or `mcp_stitch:` prefix
- **Remotion MCP**: Look for `remotion:` or `mcp_remotion:` prefix

### Step 2: Retrieve Stitch Project Information

1. **Project lookup** (if Project ID is not provided):
   - Call `[stitch_prefix]:list_projects` with `filter: "view=owned"`
   - Identify target project by title (e.g., "Calculator App")
   - Extract Project ID from `name` field (e.g., `projects/13534454087919359824`)

2. **Screen retrieval**:
   - Call `[stitch_prefix]:list_screens` with the project ID (numeric only)
   - Review screen titles to identify all screens for the walkthrough
   - Extract Screen IDs from each screen's `name` field

3. **Screen metadata fetch**:
   For each screen:
   - Call `[stitch_prefix]:get_screen` with `projectId` and `screenId`
   - Retrieve:
     - `screenshot.downloadUrl` — Visual asset for the video
     - `htmlCode.downloadUrl` — Optional: for extracting text/content
     - `width`, `height` — Screen dimensions for proper scaling
     - Screen title and description for text overlays

4. **Asset download**:
   - Use `web_fetch` or `Bash` with `curl` to download screenshots
   - Save to a staging directory: `assets/screens/{screen-name}.png`
   - Organize assets in order of the intended walkthrough flow

### Step 3: Set Up Remotion Project

1. **Check for existing Remotion project**:
   - Look for `remotion.config.ts` or `package.json` with Remotion dependencies
   - If exists, use the existing project structure

2. **Create new Remotion project** (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm create video@latest -- --blank
   ```
   - Choose TypeScript template
   - Set up in a dedicated `video/` directory

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd video
   npm install @remotion/transitions @remotion/animated-emoji
   ```

## Video Composition Strategy

### Architecture

Create a modular Remotion composition with these components:

1. **`ScreenSlide.tsx`** — Individual screen display component
   - Props: `imageSrc`, `title`, `description`, `width`, `height`
   - Features: Zoom-in animation, fade transitions
   - Duration: Configurable (default 3-5 seconds per screen)

2. **`WalkthroughComposition.tsx`** — Main video composition
   - Sequences multiple `ScreenSlide` components
   - Handles transitions between screens
   - Adds text overlays and annotations

3. **`config.ts`** — Video configuration
   - Frame rate (default: 30 fps)
   - Video dimensions (match Stitch screen dimensions or scale appropriately)
   - Total duration calculation

### Transition Effects

Use Remotion's `@remotion/transitions` for professional effects:

- **Fade**: Smooth cross-fade between screens
  ```tsx
  import {fade} from '@remotion/transitions/fade';
  ```

- **Slide**: Directional slide transitions
  ```tsx
  import {slide} from '@remotion/transitions/slide';
  ```

- **Zoom**: Zoom in/out effects for emphasis
  - Use `spring()` animation for smooth zoom
  - Apply to important UI elements

### Text Overlays

Add contextual information using Remotion's text rendering:

1. **Screen titles**: Display at the top or bottom of each frame
2. **Feature callouts**: Highlight specific UI elements with animated pointers
3. **Descriptions**: Fade in descriptive text for each screen
4. **Progress indicator**: Show current screen position in walkthrough

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Gather Screen Assets

1. Identify target Stitch project
2. List all screens in the project
3. Download screenshots for each screen
4. Organize in order of walkthrough flow
5. Create a manifest file (`screens.json`):

```json
{
  "projectName": "Calculator App",
  "screens": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Home Screen",
      "description": "Main calculator interface with number pad",
      "imagePath": "assets/screens/home.png",
      "width": 1200,
      "height": 800,
      "duration": 4
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "title": "History View",
      "description": "View of previous calc
