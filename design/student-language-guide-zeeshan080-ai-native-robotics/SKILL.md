# Student Language Guide

## Instructions

When writing student-facing content:

1. Use clear, accessible language
2. Avoid internal jargon and labels
3. Include analogies for complex concepts
4. Match language complexity to layer

## Golden Rules

1. **Never expose internal labels** (L1, L2, etc. to students)
2. **Avoid jargon** without explanation
3. **Use active voice** for instructions
4. **Include analogies** for abstract concepts
5. **Be encouraging** but not condescending

## Language Dos and Don'ts

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| "In this lesson, you'll learn..." | "This L2 content covers..." |
| "Think of a robot like a..." | "The robot abstraction..." |
| "Try this exercise" | "Execute the following procedure" |
| "You've learned a lot!" | "Basic concepts completed" |
