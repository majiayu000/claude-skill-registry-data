# Renewal Playbooks System Skill

## When to Use
- Building standardized renewal motions (green maintainers, yellow accelerators, red save plays).
- Coordinating cross-functional resources for strategic accounts.
- Training CSM/AEs on messaging, proofs, and negotiation sequences.

## Framework
1. **Segmentation** – define tiers, ARR thresholds, personas involved, and governance requirements.
2. **Trigger Matrix** – map health indicators and risk levels to recommended plays.
3. **Narrative Blocks** – curate value stories, ROI stats, roadmap previews, and reference assets per persona.
4. **Commercial Guardrails** – outline pricing levers, discount approvals, and deal-desk steps.
5. **Measurement** – tie each play to conversion, churn, and NRR metrics with review cadence.

## Templates
- Playbook card (objective, trigger, assets, timeline, owner, metrics).
- Meeting brief template for QBR/EBR with executive checklist.
- Risk mitigation plan linking issues to functional owners.

## Tips
- Pair with `escalation-framework` for red-tier governance.
- Refresh narratives quarterly with product + marketing to keep proof points current.
- Include structured feedback loops so CSMs capture deviations that worked well.
