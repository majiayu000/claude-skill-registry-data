# Quick Principles Refresher

You know these. Here's the checklist.

## The 12

1. **Squash/Stretch** - Volume constant, shape varies. Check your impacts and fast motion.

2. **Anticipation** - Is the audience prepared? Opposite direction, proportional to action.

3. **Staging** - Silhouette test. One idea. Where's the eye going?

4. **Straight Ahead / Pose to Pose** - Right method for this shot? Maybe hybrid.

5. **Follow Through / Overlap** - Does everything stop at once? (It shouldn't.) Hierarchy: root leads, tips lag.

6. **Slow In / Out** - Checked your spacing charts? Bunched at ends, spread in middle.

7. **Arcs** - Track the paths. Everything curves unless intentionally broken.

8. **Secondary Action** - Supporting, not competing. Add after primary works.

9. **Timing** - Frame count matches intent? Weight, mood, pacing all live here.

10. **Exaggeration** - Did you push it enough? (Probably not.) Find real, then go 20% past.

11. **Solid Drawing** - Does it have weight? Volume consistent through motion?

12. **Appeal** - Would you watch this? Clear shapes, readable pose, distinctive design?

## Quick Diagnosis

**Floaty?** Check timing and slow in/out. Probably too even.

**Stiff?** Add overlap. Offset timing. Break symmetry.

**Confusing?** Staging issue. Simplify. One idea per shot.

**Mechanical?** Arcs are probably too straight. Add anticipation variety.

**Dead?** Secondary action missing. Overlap insufficient.

**Boring?** Push exaggeration. Check appeal. Vary timing.

## Shot Checklist

Before calling it done:

- [ ] Silhouette reads
- [ ] Arcs tracked
- [ ] Spacing varied (slow in/out)
- [ ] Overlap on all appendages
- [ ] Secondary action supports (doesn't compete)
- [ ] Exaggeration appropriate to style
- [ ] Timing matches weight and mood
- [ ] Anticipation proportional
- [ ] Volume consistent
- [ ] Appeal present

## Principle Priority by Shot Type

**Action:** Timing > Arcs > Anticipation > Squash/Stretch
**Dialogue:** Staging > Secondary > Timing > Appeal
**Comedy:** Timing > Exaggeration > Anticipation > Staging
**Subtle acting:** Secondary > Overlap > Timing > Staging

Trust your instincts. You've done this. This is just calibration.
