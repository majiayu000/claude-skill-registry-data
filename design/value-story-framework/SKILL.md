# Value Story Framework Skill

## When to Use
- Translating discovery insights into quantified impact stories.
- Preparing executive briefings or RFP narrative sections.
- Aligning sellers, value engineers, and finance on assumptions.

## Framework
1. **Headline Impact** – state quantified outcome (savings, revenue, risk reduction) with time horizon.
2. **Driver Pillars** – break impact into 3-4 drivers with supporting data or benchmark references.
3. **Proof Layer** – attach customer stories, product metrics, or analyst stats per driver.
4. **Execution Plan** – outline phases, required resources, and success metrics.
5. **Decision Ask** – specify commitments, timeline, and next-step expectations.

## Templates
- Value narrative deck outline (headline, drivers, proof, plan, ask).
- ROI/TCO worksheet with inputs, assumptions, scenario toggles.
- Executive one-pager layout for CXO readouts.

## Tips
- Keep assumptions transparent; include sensitivity +/- ranges.
- Mirror customer language from discovery to reinforce credibility.
- Pair with `cxo-briefing-kit` to ensure outputs land with each stakeholder.
