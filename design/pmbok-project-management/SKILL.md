## Project Management Tools & Techniques

### Critical Path Method (CPM)
**Purpose**: Identify longest path through project (critical activities)
**Calculations**:
- Forward pass: Calculate Early Start (ES) and Early Finish (EF)
- Backward pass: Calculate Late Start (LS) and Late Finish (LF)
- Float/Slack = LS - ES or LF - EF
- Activities with zero float are on critical path

### Earned Value Management (EVM)
**Purpose**: Integrated project performance measurement
**Key Metrics**:
- PV (Planned Value): Authorized budget for work scheduled
- EV (Earned Value): Authorized budget for work completed
- AC (Actual Cost): Actual cost for work completed
- BAC (Budget at Completion): Total planned budget

**Variances**:
- CV (Cost Variance) = EV - AC (negative = over budget)
- SV (Schedule Variance) = EV - PV (negative = behind schedule)

**Performance Indexes**:
- CPI (Cost Performance Index) = EV / AC (< 1.0 = over budget)
- SPI (Schedule Performance Index) = EV / PV (< 1.0 = behind schedule)

**Forecasting**:
- EAC (Estimate at Completion) = BAC / CPI
- ETC (Estimate to Complete) = EAC - AC
- VAC (Variance at Completion) = BAC - EAC
- TCPI (To-Complete Performance Index) = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)

### RACI Matrix
**Purpose**: Clarify roles and responsibilities
**Definitions**:
- **R (Responsible)**: Does the work
- **A (Accountable)**: Ultimately answerable (only one A per task)
- **C (Consulted)**: Provides input (two-way communication)
- **I (Informed)**: Kept up-to-date (one-way communication)

### Decision Tree Analysis
**Purpose**: Choose between alternatives considering uncertainty
**Method**:
- Calculate Expected Monetary Value (EMV) for each branch
- EMV = Probability × Impact (monetary value)
- Choose path with highest EMV for opportunities
- Choose path with lowest EMV for threats

## PMP Certification Exam Tips

### Exam Structure (Current as of 2024)
- **180 questions** (175 scored, 5 pretest)
- **230 minutes** (3 hours 50 minutes)
- **Computer-based** at Pearson VUE centers or online proctored
- **Format**: Multiple choice, multiple response, matching, hotspot, limited fill-in-the-blank

### Exam Domains (PMBOK 7 - New Exam Content Outline)
1. **People** (42%): Managing and leading teams
2. **Process** (50%): Technical project management
3. **Business Environment** (8%): Strategic alignment and benefits realization

### Study Approach
1. Read PMBOK Guide (at least twice)
2. Understand processes and ITTOs (Inputs, Tools & Techniques, Outputs)
3. Memorize formulas (EVM, CPM, Communications channels)
4. Practice with sample questions (1000+ questions recommended)
5. Take full-length practice exams
6. Review Rita Mulcahy, Andy Crowe, or similar prep books
7. Join study groups
8. Use flashcards for terminology
9. Watch online tutorials
10. Review exam content outline from PMI

### Key Formulas to Memorize

**Communications Channels**: n(n-1)/2

**PERT Three-Point Estimate**:
- Estimate = (O + 4M + P) / 6
- Standard Deviation = (P - O) / 6

**EVM Formulas**:
- CV = EV - AC
- SV = EV - PV
- CPI = EV / AC
- SPI = EV / PV
- EAC = BAC / CPI (typical scenario)
- ETC = EAC - AC
- VAC = BAC - EAC
- TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)

**Point of Total Assumption (PTA)** for FPIF contracts:
- PTA = ((Ceiling Price - Target Price) / Buyer's Share Ratio) + Target Cost

### Common Exam Traps
- Questions may have multiple "correct" answers - choose the BEST one
- Read questions carefully - what is the project manager doing NOW?
- Consider PMBOK "ideal world" not real-world shortcuts
- Don't bring biases from your organization
- Watch for situational vs. knowledge questions
- First time mentions matter (e.g., "first time" = collect requirements)

## Agile and Hybrid Approaches (PMBOK 7)

### Agile Principles Integration
- Iterative and incremental delivery
- Adaptive planning
- Customer collaboration
- Responding to change
- Self-organizing teams
- Frequent inspection and adaptation

### Common Agile Frameworks
- **Scrum**: Sprint-based, roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team)
- **Kanban**: Visual workflow, WIP limits, continuous flow
- **SAFe**: Scaled Agile Framework for enterprises
- **Lean**: Eliminate waste, amplify learning, deliver fast

### Hybrid Approaches
- Combine predictive and adaptive methods
- Use predictive planning for stable requirements
- Use adaptive delivery for uncertain scope
- Tailor approach to project needs
