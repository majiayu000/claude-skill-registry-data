# Anticipation & Payoff

Think like a comedian setting up a punchline. Every great moment is earned by what came before. The windup is half the pitch.

## Core Mental Model

Before animating any action, ask: **What prepares the audience for this?**

Anticipation isn't just physical preparation—it's a promise. You're telling the audience "something's coming" so they're primed to receive it. The payoff is keeping that promise with interest.

## The 12 Principles Through Setup-Delivery

**Anticipation** — The principle itself. Before going right, go left. Before jumping up, crouch down. The opposite direction creates spring-loaded energy.

**Timing** — Setup needs time to register. Rush the anticipation and the payoff feels random. Hold it too long and tension deflates. Find the sweet spot.

**Staging** — Frame the anticipation so it's unmissable. The audience can't appreciate a payoff they weren't prepared for. Clear staging of setup = satisfying delivery.

**Exaggeration** — Push the anticipation to heighten payoff. A bigger windup = bigger impact. But match scales—extreme setup needs extreme delivery.

**Follow Through & Overlapping Action** — Payoff has aftermath. The action doesn't end at impact; it resolves through settling motion. Let consequences play out.

**Secondary Action** — Setup through supporting elements. Environment reacts to gathering energy. Other characters notice. Secondary actions can foreshadow the main event.

**Slow In & Slow Out** — Ease into anticipation (building tension), snap through the action (release), ease out of payoff (resolution). The rhythm of drama.

**Squash & Stretch** — Compression before extension. Squash is stored energy (setup). Stretch is released energy (payoff). Physical metaphor for narrative structure.

**Arcs** — Setup and payoff follow complementary arcs. The anticipation arc winds backward; the action arc springs forward. Together they form a complete gesture.

**Appeal** — Well-structured anticipation-payoff is inherently satisfying. Audiences love the rhythm of setup and delivery. It's why jokes work.

**Straight Ahead & Pose to Pose** — Plan your key moments: anticipation pose, action peak, payoff pose. Then connect them. Know your destination before you travel.

**Solid Drawing** — Maintain volume through the sequence. The same character in setup and payoff must read as the same mass. Consistency grounds the action.

## Practical Application

**Types of Anticipation:**
- Physical: Crouch before jump, pullback before throw
- Emotional: Inhale before outburst, stillness before action
- Environmental: Quiet before storm, calm before chaos
- Comedic: Pause before punchline, look before double-take

**Payoff Techniques:**
- Exceed expectation: Deliver more than the setup promised
- Subvert expectation: Deliver something unexpected (comedy)
- Delay gratification: Multiple anticipations before one big payoff
- Instant release: Snap from full anticipation to peak action

When payoff feels "weak":
1. Extend anticipation duration
2. Increase anticipation magnitude
3. Add secondary anticipation cues
4. Sharpen the contrast between setup and action

When setup feels "telegraphed":
1. Reduce anticipation duration
2. Distract with secondary action
3. Use environmental anticipation instead of character
4. Let payoff extend beyond expectation

## The Golden Rule

**Every action is a tiny story: beginning, middle, end.** Anticipation is "once upon a time," action is "and then," payoff is "the end." Skip any chapter and the story fails.
