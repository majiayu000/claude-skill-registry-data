description: "Runs a 7-step UX pipeline with parallel research plus product planning. Use for features, redesigns, discovery, or agent-ready exports."

---

## Modes

- **auto** (`/ux`): Runs through all 7 steps without stopping
- **full** (`/ux full`): Asks questions at each step
- **product**: Product planning — vision, roadmap, data model, design system, export (merged from lev-design-os)

## Architecture Context

> `ls ~/lev/core/ | sort` for real module layout
> Poly surfaces (CLI/MCP/HTTP/gRPC/WS) are the delivery targets for designed features
> DNA contracts govern what plugins/core modules must declare
> HostSurface interface in domain defines capability-based surface registration

## Related Skills

- `design-to-bd` — Creates BD tasks from design
- `lev-cdo` — Complex design decisions
- `sidequest` — Routes by complexity

# lev-design - UX-First Design Pipeline

## Lev Concept

**What is this?**
A 7-step agentic workflow that transforms product ideas into validated wireframes. Each step uses specialized frameworks and produces machine-readable artifacts.

**Why does it exist?**
Design is a late-stage compression step. UX teams don't start with screens - they start by understanding problems, jobs, tasks, and information architecture. This skill encodes that process.

**When to use it:**
- Starting a new feature
- Redesigning existing flows
- Product discovery
- Mobile/desktop app design
- Dashboard/admin UI design

**When NOT to use it:**
- Simple bug fixes → Just fix it
- Copy changes → Direct edit
- Already have wireframes → Skip to implementation

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Auto mode - runs all 7 steps without stopping
/ux "Design the onboarding flow for OpenClaw iOS app"

# Interactive mode - asks questions at each step
/ux full "Design the settings screen"

# Jump to specific step (with prior context)
/ux step 4 --context ./ux-2026-02-01/

# Compare wireframes to current implementation
/ux compare ./ux-2026-02-01/ ./apps/ios/Sources/
```

---

## Team Structure

Each step spawns:

**3 Research Agents (Parallel):**
- Codebase patterns (Explore)
- Documentation/decisions (Explore)
- Industry best practices (general-purpose + web)

**3 Skill Phases (Sequential):**
- Framework Application
- Artifact Generation
- Validation

## Integration with Lev Ecosystem

**Before design:**
- `lev get` - Gather existing patterns
- `lev-research` - Industry research

**After design:**
- `design-to-bd` - Create epics/tasks
- `sidequest` - Route implementation by complexity
- `lev-builder` - POC → Production

**During design:**
- `lev-cdo` - Complex architectural decisions
- `interview` - Framework-powered brainstorming

---

## Expand/Collapse Behavior

**Auto-expand when:**
- Unresolved questions remain
- Validation found conflicts
- Complexity > 7
- User requested "full" mode

**Auto-collapse when:**
- High confidence answers
- Clean validation
- Complexity < 4
- User requested "auto" mode

---

## Pivot Detection

Stop and prompt if:
- Fundamental assumption invalidated
- Requirements conflict discovered
- Technical blocker found
- Better alternative revealed by research

---

## Example Usage

```
> /ux "Design chat interface for OpenClaw iOS"

🔍 Phase 0: Prior Art Check
├─ Found: ChatView.swift, MessageBubble.swift
├─ Found: Previous chat redesign epic (clawd-chat-v2)
└─ Research: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini UI patterns

📋 Step 1: Problem Framing
├─ Problem: Users need fast, intuitive AI chat on mobile
├─ Constraints: iOS 17+, offline-first, accessibility
└─ Success: <2s response display, 95% task completion

👤 Step 2: JTBD
├─ Job 1: "When I need quick answers, I want to ask naturally"
├─ Job 2: "When context matters, I want to share screenshots"
└─ User types: INTJ (power user), ESFP (casual)

... [Steps 3-7] ...

✅ Complete: ./ux-2026-02-01/
├─ 7 artifacts generated
├─ SYNTHESIS.md ready for review
└─ Comparison: 12 differences from current ChatView
```

## Technique Map
- **Role definition** - Clarifies operating scope and prevents ambiguous execution.
- **Context enrichment** - Captures required inputs before actions.
- **Output structuring** - Standardizes deliverables for consistent reuse.
- **Step-by-step workflow** - Reduces errors by making execution order explicit.
- **Edge-case handling** - Documents safe fallbacks when assumptions fail.

## Technique Notes
These techniques improve reliability by making intent, inputs, outputs, and fallback paths explicit. Keep this section concise and additive so existing domain guidance remains primary.

## Prompt Architect Overlay
### Role Definition
You are the prompt-architect-enhanced specialist for lev-design, responsible for deterministic execution of this skill's guidance while preserving existing workflow and constraints.

### Input Contract
- Required: clear user intent and relevant context for this skill.
- Preferred: repository/project constraints, existing artifacts, and success criteria.
- If context is missing, ask focused questions before proceeding.

### Output Contract
- Provide structured, actionable outputs aligned to this skill's existing format.
- Include assumptions and next steps when appropriate.
- Preserve compatibility with existing sections and related skills.

### Edge Cases & Fallbacks
- If prerequisites are missing, provide a minimal safe path and request missing inputs.
- If scope is ambiguous, narrow to the highest-confidence sub-task.
- If a requested action conflicts with existing constraints, explain and offer compliant alternatives.
