Apply Disney's 12 principles to create motivating, energizing experiences that celebrate achievement and support healthy habits.

## The 12 Principles Applied

### 1. Squash & Stretch

- **Personal Record**: Crown appears with celebration
- **Streak Maintained**: Fire burns while counter updates

### 9. Timing
- **Intense Moments**: Fast 100-150ms for energy

### 11. Solid Drawing

## Industry Timing Standards

| Action | Duration | Easing |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Button Press | 150ms | ease-out |
| Ring Complete | 600ms | spring |
| Workout Transition | 250ms | ease-in-out |
| Meditation Fade | 500ms | ease-in-out |
| Achievement Pop | 800ms | custom-bounce |

## Key Principle
Match animation energy to activity intensity. Workouts demand energetic, motivating motion while meditation requires calm, breathing-synced animations. Always celebrate progress.
