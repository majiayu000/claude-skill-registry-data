# Participant Operations Hub Skill

## When to Use
- Running qualitative or quantitative studies that require participant coordination.
- Ensuring compliance with privacy, NDAs, and incentive tax regulations.
- Centralizing communications with participants across multiple projects.

## Framework
1. **Recruiting Intake** – capture persona, quota, source, incentive, consent requirements.
2. **Screening & Approval** – automated screeners, manual reviews, and stakeholder sign-off.
3. **Scheduling & Logistics** – calendars, reminders, backups, language/localization support.
4. **Consent & Compliance** – template agreements, data retention policy, anonymization workflow.
5. **Incentive Fulfillment** – payment processor, W-9 or tax forms, fulfillment SLA, audit log.

## Templates
- Recruiting tracker with status, notes, and consent links.
- Email sequences for invite, confirmation, reminder, thank-you.
- Incentive fulfillment checklist + finance handoff doc.

## Tips
- Keep participant PII in a restricted workspace; expose IDs/tags externally.
- Track over-contact frequency to avoid panel fatigue.
- Pair with `orchestrate-qualitative-lab` and `launch-quantitative-survey` for hands-free logistics.
