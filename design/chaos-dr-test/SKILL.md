# Chaos DR Test

Create and edit Harness DR Test pipelines — pipelines with a `DRTest` stage
containing `ChaosFault`, `ChaosProbe`, `ChaosAction`, and `Chaos` steps — via MCP.

MANDATORY — Tool Result Verification:
- NEVER claim a tool call succeeded without an explicit success response from the tool.
- NEVER fabricate, assume, or pre-empt tool results. If you called a tool and did not receive a confirmed result, say so and retry.
- When a tool returns a review/elicitation prompt (e.g., "Waiting for user to review before update..."), the user's approval does NOT mean the operation completed. You MUST wait for the follow-up tool response confirming execution before reporting success.
- If the tool response is ambiguous or missing, tell the user honestly and offer to retry.

## Scope Rules

Follow [`references/scope-establishment.md`](../../references/scope-establishment.md) for establishing org/project scope before calling `harness_list`, `harness_get`, `harness_create`, `harness_update`, or `harness_execute` in this skill:

- Parse `org` / `project` from the user's message or a pasted Harness UI URL first.
- Ask only for what is missing — do not re-ask for values already known.
- Restate the active scope before the first mutating call.
- Never invent a default org/project. If either is missing, ask the user to select it before calling a project-scoped resource; do not fall back to account scope silently.

## Instructions

### YAML Output Conventions

**Output style** — always emit block-style YAML for pipeline manifests (each key on its own line, list items on their own line with `-`, children indented). The YAML examples shown in `references/components.md` (Series + Parallel Steps, Full DRTest Pipeline, Chaos step) appear as minified JSON purely for token efficiency — JSON parses identically to YAML, so the examples remain authoritative for field names and structure, but the pipeline YAML you produce MUST be block-style matching the canonical scaffold below. Never put JSON in the request body for `harness_create` or `harness_update` pipeline YAML.

### DR Test Pipeline Rules

#### Identifying a DR Test Pipeline

Two ways to verify a pipeline is a DR Test:

1. **Check pipeline tags** — DR Test pipelines have `module: drtest` in their top-level `tags`. Additionally, stages within the pipeline have `type: DRTest`.
2. **List via MCP** — Call `harness_list(resource_type="chaos_dr_test", org_id="<org_id>", project_id="<project_id>")` to get all DR Test pipelines in the project. If the pipeline appears in this list, it is a DR Test. Pass `org_id`/`project_id` using the active scope (see Scope Rules above).

#### DRTest Stage and Steps

Chaos-related steps (`ChaosFault`, `ChaosProbe`, `ChaosAction`, `Chaos`) can ONLY be added to a stage with `type: DRTest`. They are not valid in any other stage type.

#### DRTest Pipeline — Created via MCP with Empty Steps

When a user creates a DR Test via `harness_create(resource_type="chaos_dr_test", org_id="<org_id>", project_id="<project_id>", body={"name": "...", "identifier": "..."})`, the pipeline is generated with `steps: []`. The create response returns metadata only — fetch the full YAML with `harness_get(resource_type="pipeline", resource_id="<identifier>_pipeline", org_id="<org_id>", project_id="<project_id>")` (pass `org_id`/`project_id` using the active scope on both calls):

```yaml
pipeline:
  description: ""                          # optional, user can update later
  identifier: test_new_dr_test_pipeline    # auto: <identifier>_pipeline, does NOT change
  name: test new dr test pipeline          # auto: <name> Pipeline, user can update
  orgIdentifier: default                   # from account context, does NOT change
  projectIdentifier: ChaosDev1             # from account context, does NOT change
  stages:
    - stage:
        description: Optional Description  # optional, user can set at create or update later
        identifier: test_new_dr_test       # auto-derived from name, does NOT change
        name: test new dr test             # user-provided name, user can update
        objective: Optional Objective      # optional, user can set at create or update later
        spec:
          execution:
            steps: []                      # EMPTY — agent must populate with chaos steps
        tags:
          someTag: value                   # optional, user can add at create or update later
        type: DRTest                       # fixed, set at stage creation — do NOT remove
  tags:
    module: drtest                         # fixed, auto-set by MCP — do NOT remove
```

**Note:** The example above shows the minimal structure. A real pipeline may contain additional fields (e.g., `allowStageExecutions`, `notificationRules`, `flowControl`, `timeout`, etc.) — preserve any extra fields present in the fetched YAML as-is. Do not remove or overwrite them.

The stage-level `environment` block is NOT used by DRTest pipelines. It may appear in fetched YAML but is ignored by the backend:

    environment:
      environmentRef: demo
      deployToAll: false
      infrastructureDefinitions:
        - identifier: qaauto1

Do not ask the user to provide stage-level environment or infrastructure — each chaos step has its own `infraReference` field instead (see `references/components.md` Step 1). If this block already exists in fetched YAML, preserve it as-is — do not remove it.

The agent's job is to populate `steps: []` with chaos steps (`ChaosFault`, `ChaosProbe`, `ChaosAction`, `Chaos`) using the workflow described in `references/components.md`. Only these chaos step types are valid inside a `DRTest` stage.

**Naming convention:** if user creates a DR Test with name `test new dr test` (identifier auto-derived as `test_new_dr_test`):
- Pipeline identifier = `test_new_dr_test_pipeline` (auto: `<identifier>_pipeline`)
- Pipeline name = `test new dr test pipeline` (auto: `<name> Pipeline`)
- Stage identifier = `test_new_dr_test` (auto-derived from name)
- Stage name = `test new dr test` (= the name provided by the user)

Optional stage fields: `description`, `objective`, `tags`, `runMode`, `variables`, `delegateSelectors`, `failureStrategies`, `when`, `timeout`.

### Intent Routing

#### Step 0: Detect intent — Create or Edit

Parse the user's ORIGINAL message (the one that triggered this skill) to determine their intent. Do NOT ask them "create or edit?" again — their original message already tells you.

**Intent signals:**

| Intent | Keywords in the user's original message |
|---|---|
| **Create** | create, build, set up, set-up, new, make, add (a new DR Test / new step), launch |
| **Edit** | edit, update, modify, change, fix, adjust, rename, tweak, remove, delete, add to an existing |
| **Ambiguous** | "DR Test" or "chaos step" alone with no verb |

**Routing:**

- **Create intent detected** -> read `references/create.md` — creates a brand-new DR Test pipeline, then proceeds to the Choose Action hub.
- **Edit intent detected** -> read `references/edit.md` — looks up an existing pipeline by name/identifier, confirms, then proceeds to the Choose Action hub.
- **Ambiguous** -> ask the user:
  > Would you like to **create** a new DR Test (or add new chaos steps) or **edit** an existing DR Test pipeline?

Once the path is determined, do NOT ask again.

Step-building mechanics (naming, environment/infra selection, fault/probe/action/experiment selection, runtime variables, saving) live in `references/components.md` and are shared by both the create and edit flows.

For standalone Chaos Experiment YAML (not a pipeline step), stop and use `chaos-experiment` instead.

## Examples

- "Create a new DR Test pipeline called payment-db-failover with a pod-delete fault" -> route to `references/create.md`
- "Add a probe step to my existing `test_new_dr_test` DR Test" -> route to `references/edit.md`
- "Remove the ChaosAction_1 step from the DR test pipeline" -> route to `references/edit.md`
- "What steps can go inside a DRTest stage?" -> answered directly from this file (`DRTest Stage and Steps`)

## Performance Notes

- Step 1 (environment/infrastructure selection) MUST be re-run for every new `ChaosProbe` / `ChaosFault` / `ChaosAction` step, even when adding steps in parallel — never reuse a prior step's `infraReference`.
- Do not guess probe/fault/action identities or infrastructure IDs. Always call the matching `harness_list` and use the returned values.
- The pipeline update call (`harness_update`) is a full-replace PUT — always fetch the current YAML first and apply only the requested changes, preserving every existing field.
- Wait for the tool's confirmed response before reporting success; a review/elicitation prompt is not a completed save.

## Troubleshooting

- **Pipeline update erased existing steps/fields** — the update endpoint is a full-replace PUT; always `harness_get` the current YAML immediately before modifying and re-sending it, per `references/components.md` Step 4.
- **Chaos step rejected outside a DRTest stage** — `ChaosFault` / `ChaosProbe` / `ChaosAction` / `Chaos` steps are only valid inside a stage with `type: DRTest`; verify the target stage type before adding steps.
- **Duplicate step name/identifier error** — every step `name` and `identifier` must be unique within the stage; check existing steps before naming a new one.
- **Ambiguous create vs. edit intent** — if Step 0's keyword signals do not clearly resolve, ask explicitly per Step 0 rather than guessing; creating a duplicate pipeline is harder to undo than asking one clarifying question.
