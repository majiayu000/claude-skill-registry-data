## Industry Timing Standards

| Action | Duration | Easing |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Button Press | 100ms | ease-out |
| Menu Transition | 200ms | ease-out |
| Victory Animation | 1000-2000ms | custom-bounce |

| Card Flip | 300ms | ease-in-out |

## Key Principle
Entertainment is about emotion. Use animation to amplify feelings - excitement, tension, triumph, and joy. Don't hold back when the moment calls for spectacle.
