# Account-Based Blueprint Skill

## When to Use
- Kicking off strategic pursuits with multi-plant or multi-division manufacturers.
- Aligning sales, engineering, partners, and exec sponsors on account context.
- Preparing executive reviews or investment asks tied to major deals.

## Framework
1. **Account Overview** – footprint, business units, strategic initiatives, installed base.
2. **Buying Centers & Stakeholders** – org chart covering operations, engineering, IT/OT, finance, procurement.
3. **Current State & Pain Map** – KPIs, constraints, compliance mandates, modernization priorities.
4. **Solution & Value Narrative** – target workloads, reference architecture, ROI metrics, competitive positioning.
5. **Pursuit Plan** – milestones, resource needs, partner involvement, escalation points.

## Templates
- Executive dossier (one-pager + slide) summarizing account insights.
- Stakeholder matrix with influence, priorities, relationships.
- Pursuit tracker with stages, owners, decision gates, and notes.

## Tips
- Refresh after every executive meeting or site visit.
- Attach site photos, process maps, or plant diagrams to improve context.
- Pair with `qualify-industrial-opportunity` and `run-deal-health-review` outputs.
