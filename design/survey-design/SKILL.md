# Customer Survey Design Kit Skill

## When to Use
- Launching new surveys or refreshing existing templates.
- Diagnosing low response quality or bias in ongoing programs.
- Training GTM teams on survey best practices.

## Framework
1. **Objective Clarity** – define single-topic goals, hypotheses, and decision criteria.
2. **Audience & Sampling** – specify personas, quotas, suppression rules, and incentive plan.
3. **Question Architecture** – balance quant vs qual questions, avoid double-barreled prompts, include screener + validation items.
4. **Logic & Branching** – outline conditional flows, progress indicators, and completion time targets.
5. **QA Checklist** – test across devices, languages, anonymity rules, and data export formats.

## Templates
- Survey brief (goal, audience, sample, success metrics).
- Question bank categorized by objective (adoption, satisfaction, pricing, roadmap).
- QA script for reviewers to confirm copy, logic, and translations.

## Tips
- Cap surveys at <10 minutes unless offering significant incentives.
- Randomize answer choices when appropriate to reduce bias.
- Pair with `stakeholder-ops` to align approvals and launch windows.
