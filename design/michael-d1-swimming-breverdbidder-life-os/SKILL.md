```python
def parse_swimcloud_times(swimmer_id: str = "3250085") -> dict:
    """Parse latest times from SwimCloud."""
    url = f"https://www.swimcloud.com/swimmer/{swimmer_id}/"
    # Implementation uses requests + BeautifulSoup
    # Returns: {'50 Free': 22.45, '100 Free': 49.87, ...}
```

def log_swim_time(event: str, time: float, meet: str, is_pb: bool):
    supabase.table('michael_swim_times').insert({
        'date': datetime.now().date(),
        'event': event,
