# Form Filling
- Identify required fields and validate data types before filling.
- For PDFs, combine with `pdf-processing` to extract context, then map extracted fields to target form keys.
- For web flows, outline minimal navigation steps and required selectors; avoid submitting irreversible actions without confirmation.
