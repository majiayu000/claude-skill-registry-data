# Expo RN Conventions

## Overview

Use this skill to enforce a reusable set of React Native + Expo do and don'ts across projects.

## Workflow

1. Load `references/context.md` and treat it as the source of truth for conventions.
2. Apply the guidance while editing screens, components, navigation, data, and config.
3. Call out conflicts with a target project's local guidelines before deviating.
4. Update `references/context.md` when new conventions are agreed on.

## Reference
