# Synthetic Rehearsal

Use this skill to simulate scenarios and stress-test systems.

## Workflow

1) Define scenario goals, constraints, and escalation triggers.
2) Generate agents/personas and initial conditions.
3) Run the simulation with checkpoints and metrics.
4) Summarize outcomes and mitigation steps.

## Output expectations
