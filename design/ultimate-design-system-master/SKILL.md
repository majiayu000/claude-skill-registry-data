# Ultimate Design System Master

## Workflow

1. **Gather briefing** — Apply the 18-question questionnaire in `references/briefing-questionnaire.md`. Retain all answers in conversation context.
2. **Present menu** — Display the 10 generators below. Accept single or multiple selections.
3. **Execute** — Load the selected `references/prompt-*.md` file as the sole source. Apply briefing data. Generate output.
4. **Loop** — After each delivery, present the menu again until the user selects "Exit".

- Use clear, professional, immediately usable formatting.
- Present the menu again after each delivery.

- [ ] Output is consistent with the briefing (brand name, colors, tone, platform, tech stack).
- [ ] Formatting is production-ready (no placeholders left unfilled).
- [ ] Menu presented again after delivery.
