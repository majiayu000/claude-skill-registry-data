# Combining Principles for Stronger Animation

You can apply individual principles. Now learn to weave them together and understand their interdependencies.

## Principle Synergies

### Squash/Stretch + Timing
Volume preservation is key. Faster motion = more stretch. The timing dictates the degree. A 2-frame anticipation needs less squash than a 6-frame one.

### Anticipation + Follow Through
These are mirrors. Anticipation magnitude should roughly match follow through. Big wind-up = big settle. They create rhythmic bookends to any action.

### Staging + Secondary Action
Secondary actions must support staging, never compete. If staging says "look at the face," secondary action in hands should point attention there, not away.

### Arcs + Slow In/Out
Arcs aren't uniform speeds. Apply easing along the arc path. Spacing should bunch at start/end of the arc, spread in the middle.

### Pose to Pose + Straight Ahead
Hybrid approach: Key poses first (pose-to-pose), then animate overlapping elements straight ahead. Best of both: structure with spontaneity.

## Common Combination Mistakes

**Over-anticipation:** When every action has massive wind-up, nothing feels spontaneous. Reserve big anticipation for big payoffs.

**Competing secondary actions:** Three things moving differently splits attention. Hierarchy matters - one leads, others support.

**Uniform timing:** Every action at 12 frames feels mechanical. Vary your timing: quick decisions, slow realizations.

**Arc neglect in follow through:** The main action arcs beautifully, then appendages move linearly. Everything arcs.

## The 12 Principles by Function

**Physics:** Squash/Stretch, Timing, Arcs, Slow In/Out
**Clarity:** Staging, Solid Drawing, Anticipation
**Interest:** Secondary Action, Exaggeration, Appeal
**Technique:** Straight Ahead/Pose to Pose, Follow Through/Overlap

## Integration Exercise

Animate a character sitting down:
1. **Staging:** Camera angle shows full body profile
2. **Anticipation:** Slight upward before descent
3. **Arcs:** Hips trace a curved path down
4. **Timing:** Faster drop, slower settle
5. **Squash:** Compress on contact
6. **Follow Through:** Arms/head continue after hips land
7. **Overlapping:** Hair settles last
8. **Secondary:** Adjusting clothing
9. **Slow Out:** Gradual stop to final pose

Layer principles one at a time. Blocking first, then refinement passes for each principle category.
