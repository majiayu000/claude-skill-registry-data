## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
Plan and implement frontend features and architectures with strong accessibility, performance, and reliability practices.

### Triggers
- **Positive:** Frontend feature work, performance tuning, accessibility audits, design-to-dev translation, state management decisions.
- **Negative:** Pure backend/system design (route elsewhere) or prompt rewrites (prompt-architect).

### Guardrails
- Structure-first: maintain `SKILL.md`, `examples/`, `tests/`, `resources/`, and `react-specialist` docs; fill gaps before work.
- Constraint clarity: HARD/SOFT/INFERRED (framework, bundle budget, perf targets, accessibility requirements, release cadence).
- Quality gates: lint/format, type-check, tests (unit/e2e), accessibility/perf checks.
- Confidence ceiling enforced (inference/report 0.70; research 0.85; observation/definition 0.95).

### Execution Phases
1. **Intake**: Capture framework (React/Next/etc.), design assets, perf/a11y targets, and release constraints.
2. **Design**: Choose state management, routing, data-fetching strategy; define component contracts and error handling.
3. **Implementation**: Build components with accessibility defaults, performance safeguards (code-splitting, memoization), and logging.
4. **Validation**: Run lint/format/type/test; measure Core Web Vitals and a11y checks; run regression snapshots where applicable.
5. **Delivery**: Provide changelog, release plan, monitoring hooks, and rollback steps.

### Output Format
- Request summary + constraints.
- Architecture/component plan and rationale.
- Validation results and risks.
- Confidence with ceiling.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Constraints confirmed and design assets referenced.
- [ ] Perf/a11y targets defined and measured.
- [ ] Lint/format/type/test run.
- [ ] Confidence ceiling stated.
