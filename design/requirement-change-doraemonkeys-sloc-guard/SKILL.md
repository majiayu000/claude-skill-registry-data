# Requirement Change

## Instructions

When user proposes new requirements or changes:

1. Review `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` and `docs/Implementation Plan.md`  to understand current task structure and priority order
2. Identify appropriate Phase/Task location for the change
3. Create/modify tasks following these principles:

Each task must:

- Be independently completable and testable
- Deliver complete functionality that can be verified (avoid partial implementations that are untestable)
- Focus on functionality and requirements (not code details)

4. Update Priority Order table if priorities change
5. For large new features, consider creating a new Phase section
6. Keep documentation concise—avoid redundancy to reduce AI context usage
