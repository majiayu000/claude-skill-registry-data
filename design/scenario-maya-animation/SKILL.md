# Maya animation (animator)

Expert animation means every frame is a choice: poses that read as drawings from the camera, holds and snaps placed on purpose, designed spacing, weight shown by resistance and a caught stop. Work big to small (story, body, face, detail); never add detail to a stage that does not read yet. An agent cannot scrub, so it measures (world and screen tracks, spacing, holds, contacts, a ballistic fit, overlap lags), then looks at a playblast or a headless sheet before calling anything done. If a sibling skill named here is missing from your available skills, ask the user to install it (`npx skills add scenario-labs/skills --skill <name>`); unattended, proceed from tool schemas and flag the gap.

**REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** scenario-maya-expert (execution channel, review loop, 2027 version traps).

Toolkit: [`scripts/mx_anim.py`](scripts/mx_anim.py). Its analysis and image layer is pure Python and ran offline.

## Stance (the expert delta)

- **Pick the workflow per shot; blocking ends when the information is in.** Neistadt: pose to pose for acting, straight ahead or extremes for flow; blocking is done when all five key categories exist (main, anticipation, overshoot and follow-through, breakdown, hold). Elver splines physical shots from the start; Camporota proves timing on two boxes first.
- **Maya is "the worst in-betweener in the world" (Newman).** Feed it keys: ones on fast actions, 2 to 4 frames apart on slow parts. Spline readiness is a test: spline the range, play; mush means back to stepped with more poses. Native Set Key reshapes neighboring curves (Wade): insert keys, prove it with a curve diff, and share keys across every control before splining.
- **Weight is resistance, then release, then a caught stop.** Wade: show what the character is up against (a delay, acceleration from rest) before its strength; strength is a frame count. Elver: more up and down reads as a balloon, not weight; weight is a fall caught abruptly, a bigger hold in the squash, residual jiggle. Heavy air is gravity-true [added physics]; Wade's weighted apex adds hang, for light or cartoony bodies.
- **Feet and spine sell every weight shift (jump, hop, landing, lift).** Camporota: animate the foot roll in every crouch, it sells the compression; in a big drop the spine drags behind the hips and only the arms drop; first passes overdo the anticipation, so dial it back; a touch-down goes flat "almost in one frame". Elver: on the first airborne frame the toe tip points back to where it left the ground.
- **Judge in camera space, at speed.** Elver: a motion trail can show a perfect 3D arc that fails on screen. Lazare: the eye goes to the biggest motion, so the non-focus character stays "appropriately still". Project tracks through the shot camera; read the playblast before any metric.
- **The base layer is the animation; mocap is precious.** Newman: a layer is a time-boxed experiment with marker keys and a protective key; never clean curves on it, merge with Smart Bake, then clean (Elver: only a late global note or an additive tremble, then bake). On mocap fix only the defect asked for, or the cascade ends "not hand key and not mocap"; after a merge, Euler filter, then delete keys down to extremes.
- **Lip sync animates sounds, not words.** Santos: jaw only first (the muppet pass), then the big five (jaw, two corners, top and bottom lip) for 90%; lead by place of articulation, bilabials on the frame. Lazare: shift every mouth key 1 to 2 frames earlier only when the whole line plays late.
- **Polish is triage; review is top down.** Elver ranks the notes, spends on the ones that pay, owns every contact frame. Newman grades Intent, Mechanics, Performance, Integration; a playblast does not prove game feel.

## Establish first

| Input                 | Why it changes the plan                                                                                                                              | Default when the brief is silent                               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Style and destination | squash, stops, closeness to reference: cartoony pushes; live action needs pose squash and no dead stops (Elver); VFX stays near reference (Neistadt) | realistic feature quality                                      |
| Frame rate            | timing numbers, `currentUnit`                                                                                                                        | 24 fps (`film`)                                                |
| Weight and strength   | frames of resistance and of overcome (Wade: decide both numbers first)                                                                               | heavy: resistance beat of 2+ frames, no hang                   |
| Rig                   | control names, IK/FK, spaces, foot roll attribute (map once with `listAttr(keyable=True)`)                                                           | hands in IK, no IK/FK or space switches inside a shot (Newman) |
| Camera                | a locked shot camera is the only judge; games also need every angle and the engine                                                                   | build the shot camera, lock it                                 |
| Reference, audio      | landmarks (contacts, takeoff, apex, landing, blinks, darts) give rhythm, then push (Neistadt)                                                        | beat list from the brief                                       |
| Game metrics          | speeds and heights agreed in round numbers before animating (Newman); root motion or in place (Epic)                                                 | in place, metrics sheet requested                              |

## Workflow

1. **Plan in numbers.** Beats with frames, the leading part per beat, key categories, contacts, windows (crouch, push, air, impacts), style; `A.store_plan(plan)`. Physical shots: `A.air_frames(rise, drop)` budgets the air. Dialogue: phrases with subtext and an action verb, ruled sounds (M, B, P, F, V, L, T, D), 2 to 4 tentpoles (Santos, Wade). GATE: frame counts add up.
2. **Set up.** fps, range, sound, shot camera locked; query the tangent defaults (2027 notes). GATE: `mx_validate.validate(profile="shot", rules={"fps": 24})` has no fail.
3. **Proxy pass (big, fast or camera-bound moves).** `A.proxy_boxes()`, key translate and lean, air with `A.ballistic_keys()`, rotation 1 to 2 frames behind (Camporota). The first anticipation is usually too big: `A.scale_curve(root, "translateY", 0.8, rest_y, time=crouch)`. GATE: `A.evaluate_gates()` on the proxy (ballistic, catch, resistance, push_fastest); `proxy_curves.png` looked at.
4. **Blocking, stepped.** `A.set_key_defaults("blocking")`; `A.key_pose(pose, f, fill=ctrls)` keys every control on every pose; passes: main, anticipations, overshoots, breakdowns (favor a neighbor, never 50/50), holds (`A.key_hold()`); `A.share_keys(ctrls)`. Never act from the neutral rig pose (Neistadt). Crouch poses: foot roll keyed, spine dragging, arms hanging (Camporota). GATE: every key category present; stepped playblast (GUI) or `tracks.png`; write the story it reads, then check silhouettes.
5. **Spline pass 1, the core.** `snap = A.snapshot(ctrls)` (the buffer curve); `A.to_spline()` on COG, spine, legs only; face, eyes, fingers stay stepped (Camporota, Santos). Air gravity-true; broken tangent into a hard landing (Newman); planted feet flat. Mush: `A.restore(snap)`, add poses. Every later key: `A.insert_key()`, then `A.curve_diff()` on sampled snapshots is ok outside its two segments (P4). GATE: `A.run_gates(plan)` ballistic, hang, catch, slide, penetration, foot_roll, spine_drag, heel_to_flat pass; no `A.overshoots()` through holds.
6. **Spline pass 2, overlap.** Arms, head, secondary: correlated chains edited together first (Newman), then `A.offset_keys()` by 1 to 2 frames down the chain. GATE: `overlap` lags not all zero; `pose_to_pose_tell` low; tracks clean in camera.
7. **Face, if the shot has one.** Body first, then the mask (eyes, brows), then the mouth: muppet jaw keyed at `A.mouth_keys(phonemes)`, big five, tongue, connection by `A.copy_curve()` (nostrils 1 frame behind the corners, dampened). Eyes linear, 2-frame darts; blinks close faster than they open. GATE: `A.jaw_report()`, `A.lip_lag()` against `A.audio_envelope()`, `A.blink_report()`, `A.transitions()`; close-ups on tentpoles.
8. **Polish, by triage.** Fix the top-ranked notes, one section at a time. Contacts and fast moves on ones; peel-off on every takeoff; impacts get a pushed squash and a bigger hold; pops become 3 frames on an arc plus an overshoot; `A.retime()` tightens a section; moving holds; a motion-blurred render before final (all Elver). GATE: every gate passes (peel_off, impact_hold included), layers merged, no sub-frames, Euler filtered, critique.md on the final playblast.

**Variants.** Cycle: poses every 3 frames, loop with `A.cycle()` before polish, offsets inside the cycle keep the period. Game clip: metrics, `A.cycle_speed()`, loop seam, root rules, then scenario-maya-pipeline-scripting. Mocap: procedures P12; retarget: P13; heavy interactions: P9.

## Quality gates

**Measurable (`A.run_gates(plan)`; pure logic `A.evaluate_gates`), for any jump, hop, landing or weight shift in the plan:** fps; heavy air g_ratio 0.8 to 1.25, hang excess at most 1 frame, constant horizontal speed; catch (60%+ of the fall speed gone in 2 frames, decel shorter than recovery), then a 3+ frame hold at the bottom; push fastest; heavy resistance beat of 3+ still frames; every crouch: foot roll moves, spine lags the hips; touch-downs flat within 2 frames; lift-off toe within 30 degrees of the takeoff spot; planted feet at most 0.2 cm/frame, penetration under 0.5 cm; pre-landing stretch; no pops outside impacts; overlap lags; moving end hold; tell under 90% after splining; no sub-frames; no layers at polish. [added] thresholds are toolkit defaults.
**Visual:** `A.review_images(plan, out)` (headless: `curves.png` stacked lanes, `tracks.png` camera-space tracks with onion-skin poses); in the GUI `A.playblast_pack()` (shot camera plus a no-lights silhouette) and a stepped-preview playblast. Read frames in time order; write the first-view read before the numbers (critique.md).

## Handoffs

**Receives** from scenario-maya-rigging and scenario-maya-deformation: the rig referenced (never imported), `validate(profile="rig")` clean, the control list with IK/FK, space and foot roll attributes, a range-of-motion playblast. Rig problems (knee pop, flipping space) go back as a note with frames.
**Delivers** shots to scenario-maya-lighting-rendering: a new saved version, `validate(profile="shot")` clean, layers merged, helpers deleted (`A.delete_helpers()`), `run_gates` JSON with no fail, the final playblast the agent looked at, what was not verified. Game clips to scenario-maya-pipeline-scripting: skeleton baked per clip, clip names and ranges (bookmarks), root rule (in place or root motion), loop seam and speed reports.

## Maya 2027 notes

- Default tangent: Auto Span (Legacy) on one doc page, Clamped on another: query `keyTangent(q=True, g=True, itt=True)`. Lock/Free Tangent Weight is now Tangent Length; Butterworth is Smooth Filter (Butterworth).
- Time Slider > Enable Stepped Preview; `A.stepped_preview()` is the scripted twin. Dope Sheet Time Snap is off since 2025.1 and `scaleKey` leaves sub-frames: `A.snap_subframes()`.
- Ghost Editor and Motion Trail Editor sit under Visualize; ghosting a skinned mesh needs Cached Playback (disabled by motion blur, Trax, classic dynamics).
- Playblast needs a model panel (GUI via mx_bridge); in mayapy use `review_images` or Arnold stills.
- Sequencer (ex Camera Sequencer): lock every camera. HumanIK bakes from its own window, not Bake Simulation. Time Editor clips never mix with animation layers. Blue Pencil replaced Grease Pencil.
