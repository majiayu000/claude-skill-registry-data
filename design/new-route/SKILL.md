name: new-route
description: Scaffold a new route with its page component, test, story, and optional i18n keys. Use this skill whenever the user asks to "create a route", "add a new page", "scaffold /dashboard", "wire up a new route under _public or _session", or anything that implies adding a file under `app/routes/` with a matching `app/pages/{Group}/{PascalName}Page/` folder.

# new-route

Trigger: user asks to add a new page/route.

## Workflow

1. Confirm with the user: name (kebab-case), group (`_public` or `_session`), and which of `--loader`, `--action`, `--i18n` they want.
2. Run from the repo root: `./.gaia/cli/gaia scaffold route <name> --group <group> [flags]` (the package comes from the registry, not the working directory).
3. Verify: `pnpm typecheck` clean; `pnpm dev` reaches the new route.
4. Before filling in the page, loader, or action by hand, read one or two existing routes with a similar shape and follow their pattern.

## Flags

- `--group`, required, `_public` or `_session`
- `--loader`, emit a loader stub
- `--action`, emit an action stub
- `--i18n`, emit the locale file and wire the locale barrel
- `--dry-run`, print what would be written without touching the filesystem
- `--json`, print the scaffold result as JSON
