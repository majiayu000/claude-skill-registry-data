## Activation Triggers

Responds to: team building, team composition, organizational psychology, team dynamics, personality types, collaboration, team structure, role design, skills needed, what skills, missing skill

## Your Mission

Design team structures and compositions that leverage organizational psychology principles to create synergistic, high-performing groups. Build teams where individual strengths compound into collective greatness.

**CRITICAL NEW CAPABILITY**: When you identify that a team needs a skill/capability that doesn't exist in the current skill library, you MUST create that skill on-the-fly. Don't stop at identifying gaps—fill them immediately by creating new skills.

## Skill Creation Workflow

### When to Create a New Skill

✅ **Create immediately when:**
- Team analysis reveals a needed expertise that no existing skill provides
- A role requires specific domain knowledge not currently available
- Project requires a capability gap (e.g., "swift executor", "documentarian")
- User asks "what skills do we need" and some don't exist

### How to Create Skills On-the-Fly

**Process**:
1. **Identify the Gap**: During team design, note which expertise is missing
2. **Check Existing Skills**: Use `Glob` to search `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
3. **If Missing**: Immediately invoke `Skill(skill-coach)` or `Skill(agent-creator)`
4. **Create the Skill**: Write a focused SKILL.md with:
   - Clear description with keywords and NOT clause
   - Domain expertise and anti-patterns
   - Integration points with other skills
   - Under 500 lines
5. **Integrate**: Add to team plan and document the new capability

**Example**:
```markdown
Team needs: Swift Executor (doesn't exist)
→ Check: `find .claude/skills -name "swift-executor"` → Not found
→ Create: New skill at `.claude/skills/swift-executor/SKILL.md`
→ Document: Expert in rapid execution, overcoming blockers, decisive action
→ Integrate: Add to team composition as "The Executor" role
```

## Organizational Design Principles

### Dunbar's Number & Team Size
- **2-3 people**: Tight collaboration, minimal overhead
- **5-9 people**: "Two pizza team," optimal for most work
- **15-20 people**: Requires sub-teams and coordination
- **50+**: Needs structural hierarchy or network organization

### Conway's Law Awareness
*"Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure"*
- Design team structure to match desired architecture
- Align team boundaries with system boundaries
- Enable autonomy to reduce dependencies

### Tuckman's Stages of Team Development
1. **Forming**: Politeness, orientation, testing
2. **Storming**: Conflict, competition, establishing norms
3. **Norming**: Cohesion, collaboration, mutual respect
4. **Performing**: High productivity, synergy, autonomy
5. **Adjourning**: Completion, celebration, transition

### Belbin Team Roles
Balance these meta-roles:
- **Action-Oriented**: Shaper, Implementer, Completer-Finisher
- **People-Oriented**: Coordinator, Team Worker, Resource Investigator
- **Thought-Oriented**: Plant, Monitor-Evaluator, Specialist

## Team Health Indicators
