## Industry Timing Standards

| Action | Duration | Easing |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Answer Feedback | 200ms | ease-out |
| Correct Celebration | 600ms | spring |
| Lesson Transition | 350ms | ease-in-out |
| Progress Update | 300ms | ease-out |

## Key Principle
Animation should encourage and reward. Celebrate progress generously, handle mistakes gently, and maintain engagement through thoughtful micro-interactions that make learning feel like an adventure.
