**Tell me:**

2. **Target audience**: Who are you trying to attract?
3. **Biggest pain point**: What's their #1 struggle?
4. **Your expertise**: What can you help with quickly?
5. **Lead magnet type** (pick one):
   - **Checklist** - Step-by-step verification list
   - **Template** - Fill-in-the-blank document
   - **Swipe file** - Collection of examples to copy
   - **Mini-guide** - Short how-to (5-10 pages)
   - **Cheat sheet** - Quick reference one-pager
   - **Toolkit** - Bundle of resources

I'll create the content plus landing page copy."
