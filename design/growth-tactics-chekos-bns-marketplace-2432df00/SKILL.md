# Growth Tactics Skill

## Core Philosophy

> "Growth is not about tricks. It's about building something people want to share."

Sustainable growth comes from creating genuine value and making it easy for people to spread that value. Tactics should amplify good content, not compensate for bad content.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Value-First Growth
- The best growth hack is making something worth sharing
- Word-of-mouth is still the most powerful channel
- Referrals come from delighted readers, not incentive hunters

### 2. Compound Growth
- Small consistent improvements compound over time
- 1% weekly growth = 68% annual growth
- Focus on sustainable rates, not spikes

### 3. Channel Diversity
- Don't rely on a single channel
- Platform algorithms change; diversify risk
- Own your audience (email > social followers)

## Newsletter Referral Programs

### Why Referrals Work

```
Key Statistics:
- Referred subscribers have 16% higher retention
- Acquisition cost is up to 92% lower than paid
- 84% of people trust word-of-mouth recommendations
- Referral subscribers have 37% higher retention, 18% lower churn
```

### Modern Referral Strategy (2024)

**The Old Model (Less Effective Now):**
```
Milestone-based rewards:
- 1 referral → Nothing
- 3 referrals → Stickers
- 5 referrals → T-shirt
- 10 referrals → Exclusive content

Problem: Very few people refer 5+ people
```

**The New Model (More Effective):**
```
Single referral for digital reward:
- 1 referral → Immediate digital product

Why it works:
- Lower barrier to action
- Digital products have zero marginal cost
- Most people will only refer 1-2 friends anyway
- Novelty of milestone programs has worn off
```

### Effective Digital Rewards

**Characteristics of Good Rewards:**
```
- Easy to consume (<10 minutes)
- Immediately actionable
- Related to your content niche
- Exclusive (not available elsewhere)
- High perceived value, low production cost
```

## Community Growth

### Building in Public

- Revenue updates (if comfortable)
- Experiments and learnings
- Failures and pivots
- Behind-the-scenes process

Platforms:
- Twitter/X threads
- LinkedIn posts
- Newsletter itself
```

### Engagement Tactics

```markdown
## Community Building Actions

Daily:
- Reply to all comments/responses
- Engage with 5-10 relevant posts in your niche
- Share valuable insights unprompted

Weekly:
- AMA or Q&A session
- Feature a subscriber or community member
- Create discussion prompts

Monthly:
- Subscriber surveys
- Community spotlights
- Collaborative content
```

## Paid Acquisition (When Ready)

### Newsletter Ads

**Platforms:**
- Paved
- Swapstack
- Sponsy
- Direct outreach

**Calculating CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):**
```
CAC = Ad Spend / New Subscribers

Example:
$500 newsletter ad
100 new subscribers
CAC = $5

Break-even calculation:
If lifetime value (LTV) = $10
CAC should be < $10
```

### Social Media Ads

**When to Consider:**
```
Use paid ads when:
- Organic channels are maxed out
- You have a proven offer
- You know your LTV
- You have budget to test

Don't use when:
- You're just starting (figure out product-market fit first)
- You can't track attribution
- You don't know your economics
```
