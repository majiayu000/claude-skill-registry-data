# Blinding Procedures Skill

## Purpose
Implement appropriate blinding to reduce bias in research studies.

## Types of Blinding

**Single-Blind**: Participants unaware of allocation
**Double-Blind**: Participants and researchers unaware
**Triple-Blind**: Participants, researchers, and analysts unaware

## Who to Blind

**Participants**: Reduce expectancy effects, placebo
**Interventionists**: Reduce performance bias
**Assessors**: Reduce detection bias
**Analysts**: Reduce reporting bias

## Blinding Strategies

**Medications:**
- Identical placebo (same appearance, taste)
- Over-encapsulation
- Matching packaging

**Behavioral Interventions:**
- Attention-matched control
- Active control condition
- Blind outcome assessors

**Assessments:**
- Automated/computerized measures
- Independent blinded raters
- Objective outcomes (less bias-prone)

## When Blinding Impossible

- Surgical interventions
- Exercise interventions
- Educational programs

**Mitigation:**
- Blind outcome assessors
- Use objective outcomes
- Report lack of blinding as limitation
