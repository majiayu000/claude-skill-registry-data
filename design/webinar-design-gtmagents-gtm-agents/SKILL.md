# Webinar Experience Design Skill

## When to Use
- Planning new webinar topics or series.
- Refreshing underperforming webinar formats.
- Coaching speakers to keep virtual audiences engaged.

## Framework
1. **Narrative Arc** – hook, context, proof, CTA, next steps.
2. **Engagement Moments** – polls, chat prompts, demos, breakout discussions, giveaways.
3. **Visuals & Assets** – slides, overlays, live demos, prerecorded segments.
4. **Speaker Roles** – host/moderator, subject matter expert, customer, demo specialist.
5. **CTA Strategy** – tailored offers (trials, workshops, consultations) and follow-up automation.

## Templates
- Agenda builder (time, segment, speaker, engagement tactic).
- Poll/question bank aligned to funnel stages.
- Speaker prep checklist (tech setup, talking points, interactive cues).

## Tips
- Engage every 4–5 minutes to combat drop-offs.
- Balance slides and live demos; use visual timers during Q&A.
- Provide value before pitch; keep CTAs clear and repeated.
