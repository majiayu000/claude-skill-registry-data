# OpenWebF Security: Store Guidelines & Compliance

## Instructions

1. Identify the update model (assets vs remote bundles) and what can change after review.
2. Use MCP docs (“Store Guidelines”, “Deployment”) as the baseline for constraints.
3. Provide a compliant rollout/rollback strategy and the risks to watch.
4. Do not modify code by default; produce a clear checklist and next steps.
