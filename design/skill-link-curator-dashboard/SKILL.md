# Link Curator Dashboard — Maintenance Skill

## Service overview

The link-curator dashboard is a FastAPI app running on **port 8090**, separate from the official Hermes dashboard (`hermes dashboard`, default port 9119). It reads from the vault at `<profile-dir>/vault/` and exposes a read-only web UI.

## Process inventory

```bash
# Find all dashboard processes
lsof -nP -iTCP:8090 -sTCP:LISTEN

# Check the command
ps -p <pid> -o pid,command

# Check working directory (macOS)
lsof -a -p <pid> -d cwd

# Check working directory (Linux)
readlink /proc/<pid>/cwd
```

**Current layout (verify with `ps aux | grep "8090"`):**
- The dashboard process typically runs `uvicorn main:app --port 8090` from `<profile-dir>/dashboard/`
- The process working directory is authoritative — do not assume the path matches the skill's description if multiple dashboard instances exist
- This dashboard is a **separate process** from the official Hermes dashboard (the `hermes dashboard` command, default port 9119). They are independent and can run side-by-side.

## Key paths

| Component | Path |
|-----------|------|
| Dashboard app | `<profile-dir>/dashboard/` |
| Main app entry | `<profile-dir>/dashboard/main.py` |
| Vault parser | `<profile-dir>/dashboard/archive.py` |
| Templates | `<profile-dir>/dashboard/templates/` |
| Vault | `<profile-dir>/vault/` |

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /` | Dashboard UI |
| `GET /health` | Health check + entry count |
| `GET /stats` | Tag counts, date distribution |
| `GET /reload-cache` | Force-clear and reload vault cache |
| `GET /calendar` | Calendar view |
| `GET /search?q=...` | Search entries |
| `GET /tag/{tag}` | Entries for a specific tag |
| `GET /day/YYYY-MM-DD` | Entries for a specific day |
| `GET /day-json/YYYY-MM-DD` | JSON feed for a day |
| `GET /graph` | Force-directed graph view (HTML + D3.js) |
| `GET /graph-json` | Graph dataset as `{nodes, links}` JSON |

## Caching — automatic

`archive.py` uses **mtime-based invalidation** — no `lru_cache`, no manual invalidation needed:

1. On every request, `get_all_entries()` checks the `mtime` of `INDEX.md`
2. If the file hasn't changed → returns cached entries (fast)
3. If the file was modified (new entries saved) → silently re-reads and rebuilds the cache

This means the dashboard always reflects the current vault state without any manual intervention. The only time you need to act is when the file can't be read (permissions, disk error) — in that case the last valid cache is served and a warning is logged.

**`/reload-cache`** still exists for edge cases (corrupted mtime, network mounts with broken stat) — it's a manual force-refresh that clears the cache and re-reads immediately.

## Dashboard went offline — restart procedure

The dashboard has **no watchdog** and dies silently (e.g. after a system reboot). Unlike the official Hermes dashboard which can be supervised by `hermes gateway install`, the link-curator dashboard must be manually restarted when the process exits. See "Dashboard went offline — restart procedure" below.

```bash
cd <profile-dir>/dashboard
./start.sh 8090
```

For a background process:

```bash
cd <profile-dir>/dashboard
mkdir -p ../logs
nohup ./start.sh 8090 > ../logs/dashboard.log 2>&1 &
```

After starting, verify readiness:
```bash
sleep 2 && curl -s --max-time 3 http://localhost:8090/health
```
Expected: `{"status":"healthy","total_entries":N,...}`

If health fails, check the background process output:
```bash
tail -50 <profile-dir>/logs/dashboard.log
```

## Validate

```bash
cd <profile-dir>/dashboard && python3 validate.py
```

> **Pitfall:** The profile root at `<profile-dir>/` also has a `validate.py` — it is a DIFFERENT file. Running `python3 validate.py` from the wrong directory gives wrong results or errors. See `references/validate-path.md` for the correct path, common wrong paths, and exit code meanings.

## Double-`---` separator trap

When removing a malformed entry from `INDEX.md` (e.g. one with a wrong header level like `# Index` instead of `### Title`), you may leave behind a dangling `---` separator. Combined with the next entry's `---`, this creates a **double separator** pattern (`---\n\n---`) which produces an empty entry chunk. The validator reports it as `ERROR: Missing or malformed ### title line` at chunk N.

**Fix**: After removing a bad entry, check the surrounding context in both `INDEX.md` and the relevant daily note file (e.g. `vault/2026-MM-DD.md`). Ensure only ONE `---` separates entries, not two. The validator will catch this (`Has errors: 1`, `ERROR: Missing or malformed ### title line`) — re-check and patch the orphaned separator.

**Why `patch` misses it**: The malformed entry sits in a section of the file where many entries share identical string patterns (e.g. `- **Summary**: ...` lines). `patch` reports `Found N matches for old_string` and refuses to guess. Use Python direct file manipulation instead:

```python
python3 - <<'EOF'
path = "<profile-dir>/vault/INDEX.md"
with open(path) as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
# Find the target line and insert/delete as needed
for i, line in enumerate(lines):
    if line.startswith("### TARGET ENTRY"):
        # remove: del lines[i-1:i+6]  (separator + entry)
        # insert: lines.insert(i, new_entry_text)
        break
with open(path, "w") as f:
    f.writelines(lines)
EOF
```

## Diagnostic checklist — "dashboard shows fewer entries than expected"

Use this sequence before assuming server-side problems:

1. **`curl http://localhost:8090/health`** — get total_entries count
2. **`curl http://localhost:8090/day-json/YYYY-MM-DD`** — check specific days; returns JSON array of entries
3. **`curl http://localhost:8090/` | grep 'entry-card'`** — count entry cards in raw HTML
4. If API returns correct count but browser UI doesn't → **browser cache**, try `Ctrl+Shift+R` or incognito window
5. If health count is fine but dashboard still shows fewer entries → possible INDEX.md chunk corruption. See `obsidian` skill → **INDEX.md Health Check** section for the Python chunk analysis one-liner that catches merged entries and double-`---` separators in seconds.

**Quick health check (always run after INDEX.md edits):**
```bash
cd <profile-dir>/dashboard && python3 validate.py
```
Expected: `Has errors: 0`, `Fully valid: N` matching vault entry count.

**Key signal**: `total_entries` from `/health` matches vault count → server is fine, client cache is the issue.

## Graph view

The `/graph` endpoint renders a D3.js force-directed graph over the vault. Data
is built by `get_graph_data()` in `archive.py` and exposed via `/graph-json`.

**Data shape** (tag-graph, two node kinds):
- `nodes`: `{id, label, kind: "tag"|"entry", count, type?, url?}`
- `links`: `{source: tag_id, target: entry_id}` — bipartite, no entry↔entry edges

**Why tag-graph instead of entry-graph**: with 100+ entries, an entry↔entry
similarity graph becomes a hairball. Tag hubs collapse shared topics into a
readable cluster, the way Obsidian's native graph view does. Entry count is
`O(entries × avg_tags)`, link count is `O(tag_appearances)`.

**Filtering rule**: tags with `count < 2` are dropped (reduces noise from
one-off tags) and entries that share zero active tags are omitted as orphans.
With 103 entries this produces ~78 tag nodes + ~101 entry nodes + ~400 links.

**Front-end interactions** (D3 v7 via CDN, no npm install):
- drag to reposition, scroll to zoom (0.3×–5×), background dblclick to reset
- click a tag node → highlight that cluster, dim the rest (click again to clear)
- dblclick an entry node → open its URL in a new tab

See `references/graph-view.md` for the full D3 template, force tuning, color
map, and a reusable starter at `templates/force-graph.html` (copy + change the
data endpoint to reuse for a different graph).

## Adding new routes (pattern)

For any new page that needs the same nav + footer as the rest of the dashboard:

1. Add the route in `main.py` (HTML response) + matching `-json` for data
2. Add `current_page` string in the template context
3. Add a nav link in `templates/base.html` (use `{% if current_page == '<name>' %}`)
4. Add CSS to the bottom of `base.html` if it needs styles
5. Add a function in `archive.py` if it parses the vault
6. Validate + restart

## Common failure modes

1. **Dashboard shows fewer entries than expected** — run validate.py; if health count matches vault count, the server is fine — the issue is browser-side
2. **Old process still running on 8090** — new start fails because port is occupied. Always kill first.
3. **Browser cache** — after any fix, always try `Ctrl+Shift+R` or incognito. The dashboard is read-heavy and browsers aggressively cache it.
4. **INDEX.md entries missing (root cause: write_file overwrite)** — the link-curator agent may have used `write_file` directly on INDEX.md without reading it first, wiping all previous entries. If only June entries show, May is gone. Fix: rebuild from daily notes using `scripts/rebuild_index.py` (see below). Prevention: use `save_entry.py` from the `obsidian` skill for all new saves — it does atomic read+patch, never full overwrite.

## Rebuild INDEX.md from daily notes

If INDEX.md was overwritten and entries are missing, rebuild from the daily notes:

```bash
cd <profile-dir>/skills/note-taking/obsidian/scripts
python3 rebuild_index.py
```

Then validate:
```bash
cd <profile-dir>/dashboard && python3 validate.py
curl http://localhost:8090/reload-cache
```
