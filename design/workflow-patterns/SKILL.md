description: Apply multi-phase workflow and handoff patterns. Use when workflow patterns guidance is required.
---
## Purpose

Help agents structure work into clear phases and handoffs once a router has decided that workflow patterns are relevant (e.g., multi-step refactors, complex plan reviews).

## IO Semantics

Input: Current plan or workflow description and any existing phase/handoff structure.
Output: Adjusted or annotated workflows that make phase boundaries, handoffs, and communication requirements explicit.
