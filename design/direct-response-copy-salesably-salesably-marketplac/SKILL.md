# Direct Response Copy

This skill creates copy that converts visitors into customers by combining strategic page architecture with time-tested persuasion principles - not templates or hacks.

## The Core Conversion Framework: AMA

With every single marketing asset, the priority is: **Audience > Message > Action**.

1. **Audience**: Identify exactly who you are talking to. Bring a real person to mind (a persona) and imagine you are speaking directly to them.
2. **Message**: What is the one key message they need to hear to move forward?
3. **Action**: What specific action do you want them to take right now?

## Objective

Write landing pages and sales copy that motivate immediate action by addressing objections, building desire, and making the next step irresistible.

## Intake Questions

Before writing conversion copy, gather context:

1. **The Offer**: What exactly are you selling? Features, pricing, terms?
2. **Target Audience**: Who is this for? What's their current situation and desired future?
3. **Main Objections**: What are the top 3-5 reasons people don't buy?
4. **Proof Elements**: What results, testimonials, credentials, or data do you have?
5. **Competitive Alternatives**: What else could they do instead? Why is this better?
6. **Desired Action**: What specifically should they do? (Buy, sign up, book call, etc.)
7. **Traffic Source**: Where are visitors coming from? What do they already know?
8. **Price Point & Risk**: What does it cost? What guarantees exist?

## Page Architecture

Structure landing pages in this proven sequence:

### 1. Hero Section
The first screen - make or break moment.

**Elements**:
- **Headline**: The big promise or transformation (see headline formulas below)
- **Subheadline**: Clarify who it's for and the main mechanism
- **Primary CTA**: The main action button
- **Hero Image/Video**: Show the product, result, or transformation
- **Trust Signals**: Logos, ratings, or quick proof

### 2. Problem Agitation
Make them feel the pain of their current situation.

**Elements**:
- Describe their current frustrating situation
- Show you understand their specific struggles
- Highlight what happens if they don't solve this
- Use their exact language (mirror their words)

### 3. Solution Introduction
Present your approach as the answer.

**Elements**:
- Introduce your unique mechanism or method
- Explain why this approach works
- Differentiate from failed alternatives they've tried
- Bridge from their problem to your solution

### 4. Features & Benefits
What they get and why it matters.

**Structure for each feature**:
- Feature: What it is
- Benefit: What it does for them
- Proof: Why they should believe it

**Example**:
- Feature: "24/7 live chat support"
- Benefit: "Never wait more than 2 minutes for help"
- Proof: "Our average response time is 47 seconds"

### 5. Social Proof
Let others do the convincing.

**Types** (use multiple):
- Customer testimonials (specific results, not generic praise)
- Case studies with numbers
- Logos of companies/publications
- User counts ("Join 50,000+ marketers")
- Expert endorsements
- Reviews and ratings

**Testimonial Formula**: "Before [situation]. After [specific result]. Because [what made the difference]."

### 6. Objection Handling (FAQ)
Address every reason they might say no.

**Common objections to address**:
- "Is this right for me?"
- "What if it doesn't work?"
- "Why should I trust you?"
- "Is now the right time?"
- "Is it worth the price?"

### 7. Risk Reversal
Remove fear of making the wrong choice.

**Elements**:
- Money-back guarantee (be specific about terms)
- Free trial period
- "Keep everything even if you refund"
- Cancel anytime policies

### 8. Final CTA Section
Make the ask with urgency.

**Elements**:
- Restate the transformation
- Summarize key benefits
- Add urgency (real scarcity, not fake)
- Clear CTA button
- Final reassurance

## Cialdini's 6 Persuasion Principles

Weave these throughout the page:

### 1. Reciprocity
Give value first - free guides, tools, insights.
*"Here's a free training on X before you decide..."*

### 2. Commitment & Consistency
Get small yeses that lead to big yeses.
*"If you've read this far, you're serious about..."*

### 3. Social Proof
People follow people like themselves.
*"10,000+ marketers use this daily..."*

### 4. Authority
Expertise and credentials build trust.
*"Featured in Forbes, used by Fortune 500..."*

### 5. Liking
People buy from people they like and relate to.
*Show personality, share struggles, be human.*

### 6. Scarcity
Limited availability increases value.
*"Only 50 spots available" (if true)*

## Headline Formulas

Use these proven structures:

### Result Headlines
- "How to [achieve result] in [timeframe]"
- "The [number]-step system for [desired outcome]"
- "Get [specific result] without [painful thing]"

### Question Headlines
- "What if you could [desirable outcome]?"
- "Are you making these [number] [topic] mistakes?"
- "Want to know the secret to [desired result]?"

### Curiosity Headlines
- "The [unexpected thing] that [achieves result]"
- "Why [counterintuitive claim]"
- "The hidden [thing] behind [desired outcome]"

### Direct Headlines
- "[Achieve result]. Guaranteed."
- "Finally, [solution to frustrating problem]"
- "[Number] people can't be wrong"

## CTA Button Copy

Action-oriented, benefit-focused:

**Bad**: Submit, Sign Up, Buy Now
**Good**:
- "Start My Free Trial"
- "Get Instant Access"
- "Send Me The Guide"
- "Reserve My Spot"
- "Yes, I Want [Specific Benefit]"

## Specificity Rules

Specific copy beats generic copy. Always choose:

| Generic (Weak) | Specific (Strong) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "Save time" | "Save 3 hours every week" |
| "Increase revenue" | "Add $10K/month in revenue" |
| "Many customers" | "12,847 customers" |
| "Fast results" | "See results in 14 days" |
| "Expert team" | "23 years combined experience" |
| "Affordable" | "$49/month (less than $2/day)" |

## Punctuation & Style Rules
- **No Em-Dashes**: Do not use em-dashes (-) or en-dashes (-) in any copy. Use hyphens (-), colons, or parentheses instead.

## Output Format

When writing direct response copy, deliver:

1. **Strategy Brief**: Audience, offer, main angle, key objections
2. **Headline Options**: 5-10 headline variations
3. **Full Page Copy**: Following the architecture above
4. **CTA Variations**: 3-5 button copy options
5. **Proof Shopping List**: Specific testimonials/data needed
6. **Mobile Considerations**: How copy should adapt for mobile

## Cross-References

- Apply `brand-voice` to ensure copy matches brand tone
- Use `positioning-angles` to inform the main angle and differentiation
- Landing page for `lead-magnet` uses these same principles
- Sales emails in `email-sequences` use abbreviated versions
- `orchestrator` routes here for conversion-focused projects
