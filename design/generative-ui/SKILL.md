# Generative UI

Use this skill to create adaptive interfaces that respect the design system.

## Workflow

1) Collect intent, data types, and performance constraints.
2) Select visualization patterns (DAG, time-series, tables) based on data.
3) Apply design tokens for typography, spacing, color, and motion.
4) Implement reactive state management and optimistic UI flows.
5) Validate accessibility and interaction feedback.

## Output expectations

- Provide a component map and state model.
- Include motion and interaction specs.
