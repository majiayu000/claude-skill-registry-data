# Research Methodology

This skill provides guidance for conducting thorough, high-quality web research and generating well-structured academic-style reports.

## Core Research Process

### Phase 1: Define Research Scope

Before searching, clarify the research parameters:

1. **Identify the core question** - What specific information is needed?
2. **Determine scope boundaries** - What aspects are in/out of scope?
3. **Establish depth requirements** - Surface overview or deep dive?
4. **Identify key terms** - What search terms will yield relevant results?

Ask clarifying questions when the topic is broad or ambiguous:
- "What specific aspect of [topic] interests you most?"
- "Are you looking for recent developments or historical context?"
- "Should I focus on any particular region or industry?"

### Phase 2: Gather Sources

Target 10+ diverse sources for thorough research:

**Source Diversity Goals:**
- Official documentation and primary sources
- Academic or research publications
- Industry expert perspectives
- News and current developments
- Multiple viewpoints on controversial topics

**Search Strategy:**
1. Start with broad searches to map the landscape
2. Refine with specific queries for depth
3. Follow citations and references from quality sources
4. Search for counterarguments and alternative perspectives

### Phase 3: Evaluate Source Credibility

Apply the CRAAP test to each source:

| Criterion | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Currency** | When was it published? Is timeliness important for this topic? |
| **Relevance** | Does it address the research question directly? |
| **Authority** | Who is the author? What are their credentials? |
| **Accuracy** | Is the information supported by evidence? Can it be verified? |
| **Purpose** | Why does this source exist? Is there bias? |

**Red Flags:**
- No author or publication date
- Sensational headlines or claims
- No citations or sources
- Single-source information on contested topics
- Clear commercial or political agenda without disclosure

**Green Flags:**
- Peer-reviewed or editorially reviewed
- Clear author credentials
- Citations to primary sources
- Balanced presentation of multiple perspectives
- Recent updates or corrections noted

### Phase 4: Synthesize Information

Organize findings thematically rather than source-by-source:

1. **Identify themes** - Group related information across sources
2. **Note consensus** - What do multiple sources agree on?
3. **Flag disagreements** - Where do sources conflict? Why?
4. **Extract key insights** - What are the most important findings?
5. **Identify gaps** - What questions remain unanswered?

### Phase 5: Generate Report

Structure reports in academic format for clarity and credibility.

## Academic Report Structure

### 1. Abstract (100-200 words)
Concise summary of the entire report:
- Research question or topic
- Key methodology (sources consulted)
- Main findings (2-3 sentences)
- Primary conclusion

### 2. Introduction
Set context for the research:
- Background on the topic
- Why this research matters
- Scope and limitations
- Brief outline of what follows

### 3. Findings (Organized by Theme)
Present discoveries organized thematically:
- Use clear section headings
- Lead with most important findings
- Include specific data and quotes with citations
- Note where sources agree or disagree
- Present multiple perspectives on contested topics

### 4. Conclusion
Synthesize and reflect:
- Key takeaways (3-5 main points)
- Implications of findings
- Remaining questions or areas for further research
- Recommendations if applicable

### 5. References
List all sources consulted:
- Use consistent citation format
- Include URLs for web sources
- Note access dates for online content
- Group by type if helpful (academic, news, official)

## Citation Best Practices

Always attribute information to sources:

**Inline Citations:**
```markdown
According to [Source Name](URL), finding here.
Research from [Organization](URL) indicates that...
```

**Reference Section Format:**
```markdown
## References

1. [Article Title](URL) - Author/Organization, Date
2. [Report Name](URL) - Publisher, Date
```

**When to Cite:**
- Direct quotes (always)
- Specific statistics or data
- Unique findings or claims
- Controversial statements
- Information not common knowledge

## Research Quality Standards

### Thoroughness Checklist
- [ ] Consulted 10+ sources
- [ ] Included diverse source types
- [ ] Searched for opposing viewpoints
- [ ] Verified key claims across sources
- [ ] Noted limitations and gaps

### Report Quality Checklist
- [ ] Clear, specific abstract
- [ ] Logical organization by theme
- [ ] All claims properly cited
- [ ] Sources evaluated for credibility
- [ ] Balanced presentation of perspectives
- [ ] Complete reference list with URLs

## File Organization

Save research to `./reports/` directory:

**Naming Convention:**
```
./reports/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md
./reports/2024-03-15-ai-trends.md
./reports/2024-03-15-renewable-energy-analysis.md
```

**Report Structure:** See `references/template-guide.md` for selection guidance. Templates available:
- `references/templates/academic.md` - Standard Academic Report (comprehensive)
- `references/templates/executive-summary.md` - Executive Summary (decision-focused)
- `references/templates/comparative-analysis.md` - Comparative Analysis (evaluating options)
- `references/templates/literature-review.md` - Literature Review (academic survey)
- `references/templates/quick-report.md` - Quick Report (rapid research)
- `references/templates/technical-implementation.md` - Technical Implementation Guide (library/tool selection)
