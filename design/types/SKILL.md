# Skill: Types

Type generation and synchronization between frontend and backend.

## Routing Logic

Analyze the user's intent and route to the appropriate workflow:

**Generate Types** → `workflows/generate.md`
- "Generate types"
- "Update frontend types"
- "Sync types from backend"
- "Regenerate API types"

**Type Usage** → `workflows/usage.md`
- "How do I use the generated types?"
- "Import types for [endpoint]"
- "Type the API response"

**Troubleshooting** → `workflows/troubleshoot.md`
- "Types are out of sync"
- "TypeScript error with API"
- "Type doesn't match response"

**Configuration Questions** → `context/config.md`
- "Where are types generated?"
- "How does type generation work?"

## Workflows

- `workflows/generate.md` - Generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI
- `workflows/usage.md` - How to use generated types
- `workflows/troubleshoot.md` - Fix type issues

## Context

- `context/config.md` - Type generation configuration
- `context/patterns.md` - Type usage patterns
