2. **Metric Spine** – adoption, value, ROI, roadmap alignment, joint KPIs.
3. **Risk & Opportunity** – top 3 blockers + mitigations; top 3 growth bets + investment needs.
4. **Executive Actions** – decisions, approvals, introductions, or resources requested.
5. **Follow-Up Tracker** – owner, due date, status, and impact measurement.
