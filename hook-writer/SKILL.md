# Hook Writer

Generate hooks using five proven psychological trigger categories.

## Process

### Step 1: Understand Context

Confirm: angle/message, target avatar, platform (FB/TikTok/Native/YouTube), desired emotional response.

### Step 2: Apply Hook Types

**1. GREED HOOKS** - Appeals to money/savings
- "How I saved $847/month on [category]"
- "They're giving away [valuable thing] free until [date]"
- "This $12 [product] replaced my $200 [alternative]"

**2. RELEVANCY HOOKS** - Current events/timely
- "New 2026 rule means [audience] can now [benefit]"
- "After what happened this week, everyone is talking about..."
- Seasonal/holiday tied

**3. EMOTION HOOKS** - Strong emotional response
- "I broke down crying when I saw my [result]"
- "The moment I realized I'd been [doing it wrong] for years"
- Fear, joy, anger, hope, surprise

**4. DEMOGRAPHIC HOOKS** - Calls out audience directly
- "I'm 52. Here are three ways [product] helped me [benefit]"
- "Attention [city] residents: [message]"
- "If you rent your home, you may have been unfairly [impacted]"

**5. CLIFFHANGER HOOKS** - Creates curiosity gap
- "You get 1% off for every second it takes me to escape"
- "After days of planning, we decided there's a legal way to rob a bank"
- Incomplete story, unexpected premise

### Step 3: Apply Headline Formulas

- Question: "Do you [behavior]? Here's why [consequence]"
- How-to: "How to [benefit] in [time] without [pain]"
- Secret: "The [adjective] secret [industry] doesn't want you to know"
- Warning: "Warning: [action] is actually [consequence]"
- Proof: "I [did action] and [measurable result]"

### Step 4: Format for Platform

**Facebook/Instagram**: Longer, text overlays, first 3 seconds critical
**TikTok**: Short, punchy, pattern interrupt, native feeling
**Native**: Headline + image, curiosity-driven, news-style
**YouTube**: Can build slower, promise clear value

### Step 5: Output Ranked Hooks
