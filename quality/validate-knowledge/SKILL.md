description: 'Prove that a knowledge base actually works before trusting it — after building or adopting docs, a knowledge graph, or a wiki, verify it can orient a fresh agent and resist false premises. Use at the end of an adoption, after a large docs change, or before relying on the graph to route work. Two methods: clean-context test agents answering known-answer and adversarial questions, and enforcement tests that plant a violation and confirm the linter catches it. A smoke test proves code runs; this proves the knowledge is correct, navigable, and honest.'

# validate-knowledge

Documentation you wrote is documentation you already believe. That is
exactly why you cannot validate it yourself: you fill every gap from
memory the reader won't have. A knowledge base is only proven when a
context that does *not* share your memory can use it to reach correct
answers, and when its own guard rails demonstrably catch violations.

This complements the code smoke test. A smoke test proves a snippet
runs; this proves the surrounding knowledge is correct, navigable, and
honest.

For version drift specifically (whether the library wiki's pins still
match the resolved dependencies), the complementary check is the
lightweight source-reconciliation pass in `research-and-ingest`; this
skill tests prose, not pin freshness.

## Method 1: clean-context test agents

Spawn agents with **no prior context** on the project and have them
answer questions using only the knowledge base. A fork of yourself
inherits your assumptions and passes a base a stranger would fail. Grade
the answers against ground truth you already know.

1. **Give them the entry point, not the answers.** Tell them to read the
   kernel and follow it, the same cold start a real session has.
2. **Ask questions whose correct answer you know**, spanning the base
   and its seams: a fact lookup, a "how does X work," a change-impact
   ("what must I check before editing Y"), a trace across subsystems.
3. **Require them to declare what they loaded**: which nodes/pages, and
   what they deliberately skipped. This tests the *routing*, not just
   the content: the right answer reached by loading half the codebase is
   a routing failure.
4. **Include adversarial false-premise questions.** "Confirm the system
   uses <technology it does not use>." "Show me the table where X is
   stored" (when X isn't stored). A trustworthy base lets the agent
   *reject* the premise with a citation; a weak one lets the agent
   hallucinate agreement. This is the highest-value test: it catches the
   gaps that ordinary questions glide over.
5. **Grade and fix, independently.** Every wrong answer, every missed
   rejection, every over-broad load is a defect in the base, not the
   agent: if the base is right and reachable, a competent cold agent
   finds it. Fix the node or the trigger; re-run. In a standalone run
   the grading is done by (or reviewed by) an agent that did not author
   the base, because an author scoring the answers re-imports the
   assumptions the clean context was meant to strip; when that is
   impossible, record the deviation with the result.
   `docs/graph/protocols/grow.md` Phase 6 already enforces this inside
   `grow`.

A base passes when a cold agent answers correctly, loads minimally, and
refuses the false premises, citing sources, without opening the raw
source tree.

## Method 2: enforcement tests

A rule the tooling claims to enforce is only enforced if you have seen
it fail on a planted violation; a pass on the real tree does not count.
Prove each guard rail:

- **Plant a violation, confirm the catch.** Copy the graph to a scratch
  location, introduce a duplicate fact-key, a broken edge, a version pin
  in the wrong node, and confirm the linter fails with the right
  message. A linter you have only ever seen pass is a linter you have
  not tested.
- **Prove drift detection.** If generated views are produced from
  sources (see `install`/multi-tool integrations), edit a source and
  confirm the `--check` mode flags the stale view; then regenerate and
  confirm it clears.
- **Wire the passing linter into the verification gates** so the base
  cannot silently rot.

## Scope and cost

Match the effort to the base. A handful of clean-context questions and
one enforcement pass is enough for a small docs set; a large graph
warrants questions spanning every tier and every guard rail. Prefer a
few sharp adversarial questions over many easy ones, because the easy
ones mostly re-confirm what you already trust.

Run this read-only: the test agents ONLY answer and report, and their
output is evidence you act on.

## What this catches that nothing else does

- A node that is *correct but unreachable*: the router never surfaces
  it, so the fact might as well not exist.
- A base that reads well to its author but leaves a newcomer guessing.
- A fabricated fact or citation that survived authoring; an adversarial
  question is how it surfaces.
- A linter or drift-check that was never actually exercised and quietly
  does nothing.
