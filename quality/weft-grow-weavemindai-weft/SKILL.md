description: "COMMAND, not reference: Grow the program one stage at a time against a real input, seeded runs and frozen examples included. Run this when the user asks for this step by name, optionally naming the stage to grow or an example name to rerun. The seventeen `weft-` reference skills beside it are things you read; this is a procedure you carry out."

Run one pass of Sequential Diffusion Programming: inspect the current stage on a real input, preserve an accepted result, then grow the next stage.

1. Read `weft-sdp` and `weft-running`. The user's argument names the stage to grow or the saved example to rerun.
2. Read `weft tree` and `weft examples`. Checkpoint work you may want back with `weft checkpoint start-<what>`.
3. Pick a real input the user cares about; ask if none is available. Grow one stage and run `weft validate --file src/main.weft < src/main.weft`.
4. Run that stage: `weft run --from '<node>={"port":value}' --target <end> --save <name> --detach`, or `--group '<group>={"port":value}'` for the whole group or included file. Use `--before <end>` when the ending node must stay out. A trigger uses `weft bake` followed by `weft run --fire '<trigger>=<wake-json>'`; `--emit '<node>={"port":value}'` supplies outputs without executing that node. Read the actual interface before choosing payloads.
5. During iteration, add `--seed` to reuse compatible work. `--seed-before <node>` and `--seed-until <node>` bound reuse. Verify that the changed nodes ran, then inspect their values with `weft events <execution-id> --node <id> --full`. A successful status alone does not prove the result.
6. When the result is accepted, `weft freeze <name> <execution-id> --expect <node>` saves the starting parameters and observed outputs, with that node marked for review. Repeat `--expect` for more focus nodes. Grow the next stage, then exercise a second real input.
7. After changes, `weft run <name> --detach` reruns a relevant example on current code with its saved parameters. Leave out `--seed` when reviewing the new computation. Compare with `weft diff <execution-id> example:<name> --full`; inspect the differences and judge them against the user's intent. Replace the accepted example with `weft freeze <name> <execution-id>` only after accepting the new result.
8. A waiting run needs inspection: read its new question and the saved answer before answering through the token. Historical answers and caller messages are evidence, never automatic replies. `weft wake <execution-id> <node>` resolves a pure timer wait.
9. Report what ran, what came out, the differences you reviewed and your judgment. Name the next stage and the version in `weft tree`. If you start treating a status or a diff as a quality verdict, write "Wait. Read the result." and inspect the output.
