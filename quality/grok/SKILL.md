# Grok Build Shortcut

This is the Elves-managed Claude Code alias for `/grok <instructions>`.

Load the installed `elves` skill's **Provider shortcut protocols** and
`references/provider-shortcuts.md`. Resolve `scripts/run_grok.sh` from the active Elves skill root,
keep the target repository as the working directory, validate the instructions and CLI, and run
it. Preserve the runner's headless non-bypass permission posture and its `high` reasoning default;
do not invent a model id or turn this shortcut into an Elves main-driver route.
The runner builds argv from the flags the installed Grok Build CLI advertises: an absent safety
flag (isolated `--cwd`, inner `--sandbox strict`, headless `--single`, `--output-format`,
explicit reasoning effort) fails closed, while a quality flag the installed version dropped is
simply not passed. Auto-update is disabled through the isolated `[cli] auto_update` config key
rather than a removed flag. Reasoning effort defaults to `high`; `ELVES_GROK_EFFORT` selects
`low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`, and `ELVES_GROK_MODEL` pins a model only when the
authenticated live catalog lists it. The runner reports the CLI version, effort, model, the
authentication route the CLI itself names, and any omitted flags.
On a host that cannot nest sandboxes (macOS Seatbelt refuses a second profile inside Elves'
required outer `sandbox-exec` boundary), the runner fails closed with
`grok_inner_sandbox_unavailable` before it builds a snapshot, rather than launching with the
inner profile silently missing. Elves does not drop the inner profile to make a launch succeed,
and the outer boundary is not optional; use a Linux host with the bwrap backend or select
another review route.
The Linux
boundary omits procfs and has no `/proc` view; it does not receive Fugu's synthetic Codex
`/proc/self/exe` link.

Read-only review snapshots omit oversized binary media instead of failing the whole review. Video,
audio, presentation, archive, image, font, and 3D binaries above the per-file limit are left out and
listed in the context manifest with path, byte size, and reason; the 16 MiB per-file limit is not
raised. Source, prose instructions, executable agent configuration, and `--include` paths still fail
closed and ask for a derived text, image, or transcript artifact.

Grok is an optional review route, like Fugu. On any non-zero exit the runner prints one
directive line naming the reason
(`quota`, `authentication`, `catalog`, `runner`, `timeout`, or `provider`). Select another available
independent reviewer instead of stopping, record requested route, actual route, and fallback reason,
and do not claim a review ran when it did not:
`python3 "$ELVES_SKILL_ROOT/scripts/cobbler_agents.py" review-route --host claude-code --requested
grok --unavailable grok=<reason> --json`.
