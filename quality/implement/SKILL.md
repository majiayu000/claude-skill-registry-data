# Implement

See the [fixed recurrence and root-cause policy](../../shared/native-skill-contract.md#recurrence-and-root-cause-policy) and [reasoning-progress escalation policy](../../shared/native-skill-contract.md#reasoning-progress-escalation) for repeated-obstacle handling; record and validate `reasoning-progress.json` before another cycle after escalation trigger.

Run linear implementation with strict gates.

Keep setup and review artifacts subordinate to the user's acceptance condition under the primary-goal rules in Reasoning-Progress Escalation. Once the fix is established, write the minimal implementation and regression before another reviewer-setup cycle. One failed bounded setup repair stops that auxiliary route; continue safe authorized implementation and retain the coverage limit without claiming clean completion.

When independent review findings are fixed in a cycle, read `../../shared/adversarial-loop.md` and apply its bounded convergence and stop rules. Use the `challenge-resolve` skill for an explicitly requested standalone loop; this workflow still owns its normal completion gates.

## Input Schema

```json
{
  "goal": "required implementation objective",
  "mode": "feature|fix|refactor|config|spike",
  "constraints": [
    "optional constraints"
  ],
  "execution": "optional auto|serial|parallel-read|parallel-write; default auto",
  "done_when": "required acceptance statement"
}
```

## Lightweight Local Work

Use a parent-only path for a small, understood, reversible local change with bounded impact and existing task authorization. A code fix plus its regression test remains one change. Routing examples are optional; tests and documentation for one change do not create separate domains.

1. Inspect the affected flow and applicable instructions; define the requested outcome. Investigate an unknown cause before editing.
2. Make the smallest authorized change. Run the relevant acceptance check and configured lint/format checks; inspect the diff.
3. Report the outcome, verification, and material limits concisely. Do not create execution plans, specialist packs, confidence worksheets, five-entry gate bundles, or final-handoff/result artifacts solely for this path. Reuse still-valid checks for unchanged source and environment.

This path takes precedence over the detailed workflow and role examples below. Select the detailed workflow for broad or risky changes, an explicitly requested structured report/review, or work requiring independent specialist coverage. Actual runtime permissions, protected-state decisions, and project-required checks still apply. Missing parallel controls select parent-serial work; they do not require another permission request for already-authorized local edits.

## Parallel Adoption (Portable read-only)

<!-- policy-sibling: skills/manage/SKILL.md (Parallel Adoption section) — near-duplicate; also see skills/code-review/SKILL.md Workflow parallel-review section as a third divergent variant; check siblings before editing this section alone -->

This skill permits only its promoted portable read-only route. Resolve execution precedence from per-invocation `--execution=<mode>`, then `CODEX_RIG_EXECUTION`, then the `auto` default. The default execution mode is `auto`. `auto` selects this route only after this consumer's runtime matrix and promotion; otherwise it resolves safely to `serial`. Serial parent work uses existing task authorization; exact-plan-digest approval applies when the promoted parallel-read route is selected. This route never bypasses consumer promotion, serial parent authority, or applicable write approval. Supplied denials or stale approvals remain invalid in every execution mode.

Follow the [canonical G0–G8 execution flow](../../ARCHITECTURE.md#canonical-g0g8-execution-flow) for shared gate order and fork outcomes. This consumer's read-only evidence passes are bounded by G0–G5; parent owns deterministic G6 integration, G7 verification, and G8 verdict/promotion.

### Safe parallel work

The promoted route permits read-only evidence, acceptance, and documentation-impact passes with immutable disjoint context packs and separate outputs. Source, test, documentation, configuration, calibration, cache, generated-output, artifact, and result writes are outside this portable route.

### Required barrier

Apply shared [host compatibility check](../../shared/specialist-orchestration.md#host-compatibility-before-dispatch) before preparing any child work. Include `read_host` only from verified launcher-supported child controls. Missing or incompatible controls make `auto` resolve serial with reason; explicit parallel-read stops before dispatch. A plan declaration is not effective-control proof, and post-run validation remains mandatory.

Before any dispatch, freeze goal, mode, `done_when`, baseline, ownership DAG, context packs, role-card hashes, checks, resource locks, and plan digest. Dispatch at most one fixed dependency-ready wave, then join every terminal handoff before implementation, integration, gates, or acceptance; changed scope requires new plan.

The frozen `<run-directory>/execution-plan.json` must include exact `consumer_policy` values `consumer_id=implement`, `capability=portable-read-only`, `promotion_status=promoted`, `parent_mutations=serial`, and `canonical_gates=serial`. It must also include `write_policy`: use `parent_writes=planned` with `approval_requirement=exact-plan-digest` when any parent mutation is planned, otherwise `parent_writes=none` with `approval_requirement=not-required`. When parallel-read is selected, a planned parent write requires `<run-directory>/write-approval.json` containing only exact plan SHA-256, `response=approve`, and `source=explicit-input|user-prompt`. Serial execution or an automatic serial fallback does not require a new digest receipt for already-authorized work.

Bootstrap exception: run-directory creation (Step 01), baseline diff/branch persistence (Step 02), and the `write-approval.json` write itself are exempt from requiring a prior approved plan digest — these precursor writes must exist before a plan digest can be computed or approved.

Before dispatch, run `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/parallel_execution.py preflight --consumer implement --plan <run-directory>/execution-plan.json --approval <run-directory>/write-approval.json`; append `--execution=<mode>` only for explicit invocation value. Omit `--approval` when no parent writes are planned or effective execution is serial and no approval was supplied. Resolve host fallback before deciding whether the parallel route needs a receipt. A nonzero result stops route.

After every spawned child reaches a terminal handoff, run `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/parallel_execution.py validate-runtime --consumer implement --manifest <run-directory>/execution-manifest.json --plan <run-directory>/execution-plan.json --parent-rollout <authoritative-parent-rollout> --sessions-dir <authoritative-sessions-directory> --run-dir <run-directory> --roles-dir PLUGIN_ROOT/roles`. Require `runtime_promotion_eligible=true`, `consumer_id=implement`, and `write_parallel_eligible=false`. Run the same preflight again after the terminal join and before the first parent mutation. Any plan, approval, consumer, runtime, or join drift stops mutation and requires a new frozen plan plus exact approval.

### Serial parent decisions

Parent owns all implementation, test, and documentation writes; shared files and dependency chains; integration and conflict handling; calibration, artifacts, and result writes; canonical quality gates; verdict; and promotion. Never expand wave dynamically or dispatch dependent work early.

### Resource conflicts

Declare only validated resource locks such as `git-index`, `cache:<path>`, `generated:<path>`, and `test-env:<name>`. Shared paths, indexes, caches, generated outputs, test environments, ports, devices, or undeclared resources force serial execution or re-planning.

### Fallback

Unavailable or unsafe fan-out uses equal-gate `serial-fallback` from the same frozen plan with the same quality gates and retained evidence. Never label fallback as parallel or weaken checks because dispatch was unavailable.

### Acceptance

This skill's shared runtime matrix and consumer promotion must remain complete before `auto` selects this route. Acceptance must prove freeze, complete join, truthful execution label, resource compatibility, equal gates, and unchanged serial parent authority.

### Stop rule

Generic parallel writes remain disabled. Stop without dispatch on missing promotion, mutable packs, ownership or resource overlap, sensitive or unproven controls, missing terminal evidence, or incomplete join; implementation, test, documentation, and all other mutations remain parent-serial.

## Workflow (Exact Commands)

### 01: Create run directory

Run `create_run.py --skill implement` per `../../shared/helper-cli-contract.md`. For parallel-adoption execution-mode selection (`auto`/`serial`/`parallel-read`/`parallel-write`), see the Parallel Adoption section above before proceeding.

### 02: Record baseline diff and branch

Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` as argv command and write stdout to `<run-directory>/branch.txt`.

Inspect `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/collect_diff.py --help`; collect `working-tree` into `<run-directory>/baseline`.

### 03: Route the change type and define ownership

Modes:

- `feature`: define public behavior, acceptance checks, docs impact, and tests before implementation.
- `fix`: reproduce or cite failing behavior before editing.
- `refactor`: preserve behavior with characterization tests or equivalent safety net.
- `config`: inventory references and calibration/routing impact before editing.
- `spike`: read-only or disposable probe; do not present as completed implementation.

Define narrowest reversible change, owners, acceptance. For 3+ steps/design tradeoffs, update plan before edit.

**Structural context (optional)**: select one task-neutral route at decision point, then invoke adapter once: `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/codemap_adapter.py context --category implementation --query-kind <kind> [--target <qname>] --out <run-directory>/codemap-context.json`. Use `skip` for exact localized edit with no unresolved structural fact, matching single route (`central`, `callers`, `blast`, `dependencies`, `test-impact`, or `coupling`) for one unresolved fact, and `standard` for broad or unknown scope. Map direct, all, or production caller questions to `callers`; use `blast` only for explicitly transitive caller questions. An explicit user or tool request for structural evidence overrides `skip`. Per `../../shared/codemap-contract.md`, absence/incompatibility is non-fatal — continue with routing above. Persist result once here, before step 05 implementation; step 06 specialist fan-out consumes `<run-directory>/codemap-context.json`, never fresh query.

### 04: Run the anti-rationalization gate before editing

- Existing code and tests for target surface have been read.
- Failure mode or new behavior is captured by failing doctest, pytest, or explicit acceptance check.
- Coding changes have project coding-principles plan from applicable `AGENTS.md` layers: simple/readable/reproducible structure first, short reusable units without low-value argument-remapping wrappers, guard clauses or early `return`/`yield`/`continue` for invalid or terminal cases, project docstring-style detection, concise purpose docstrings, and inline comments only for non-trivial implementation blocks.
- `feature` mode has feature demo contract before production edits:
  - simple public API: inline doctest or focused pytest that shows intended call and result
  - multi-step behavior: minimal example or pytest exercising user-visible workflow end to end
  - demo must be automatically executable and must fail against current code for intended missing behavior
  - if demo passes before implementation, stop and re-scope; do not silently proceed unless user explicitly overrides gate
- Review demo contract for goal alignment, API shape, missing scenarios, and automatic verifiability before implementation.
- If task starts from symptom, failing test, failing CI, flaky behavior, regression, tool/environment error, or unexplained metric shift, run `investigate` first or document equivalent root-cause evidence before editing.
- Root-cause evidence includes claim, supporting logs/code, falsification check, and at least one rejected alternative. A workaround-only change is temporary mitigation, not completion, unless explicitly requested by user.
- Behavior-preserving refactors have characterization tests or equivalent current-behavior safety net.
- The next edit is smallest reversible step, not speculative refactor.

### 05: Implement minimal change

This step's "implement" produces the draft/proposal work product for the changed surface; it is not a final merge-ready change until specialists join and the terminal review gate at Step 06 completes.

While implementing, keep code understandable from code itself:

- Apply consolidated project coding principles from applicable `AGENTS.md` layers.
- Refactor long, dense, or deeply nested blocks into named helpers/classes before adding explanatory text.
- Avoid tiny rarely used helpers that only remap arguments; keep logic inline, use local helper, or use `functools.partial` when only binding arguments.
- Match project's configured or established docstring style, and keep function/class purpose in docstrings rather than comments directly above definitions.
- Refactor instead of writing long docstrings or comments when block needs long explanation to be understandable.

Failing-first and acceptance pytest runs in this loop follow [Sandboxed Test Runs](../../shared/native-skill-contract.md#sandboxed-test-runs): add `-p no:xdist` when its conditions hold, and request the reusable pinned test-runner approval only when its trigger holds, once, before the first escalated run.

### 06: Orchestrate specialists when the change crosses a domain boundary

Read and apply `../../shared/specialist-orchestration.md` only when task crosses domains, benefits from independent verification, or splits into parallel context packs; do not load it for narrow one-domain implementation in one to three files.

Before spawning or substituting specialists, write `<run-directory>/specialist-plan.md` with one row per planned pass:

| role | trigger | context pack | expected output | mode |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |

Optional routing examples for work that actually benefits from separate expertise:

- public API or architecture: `sw-engineer` returns a proposal for review, `qa-specialist` for acceptance matrix, and `doc-scribe` for public docs/docstrings when applicable. Use `solution-architect` only when the user expressly requests that advisory pass or selects the role; it returns a bounded read-only design artifact to the Sol parent/session, which continues and accepts.
- bug fix or regression: `investigate` or equivalent root-cause evidence first, then `sw-engineer` for fix and `qa-specialist` for failure-before/pass-after proof.
- CI/tooling: `cicd-steward` for workflow behavior and `linting-expert` for ruff/mypy/pre-commit or suppression policy.
- security-sensitive code: the Sol parent/session scopes risk before implementation and pairs `sw-engineer` with `qa-specialist` as needed. Use read-only `security-auditor` only when the user expressly requests that advisory pass or selects the role; it returns bounded evidence to the Sol parent/session, which continues and accepts.
- ML/data/research behavior: `data-steward` for data contracts, `scientist` for method/metric validity, `squeezer` for performance claims, plus `qa-specialist` for tensor boundary tests.
- docs-impacting behavior: `doc-scribe` gets only verified public behavior, API signatures, examples, and migration notes; do not send unrelated implementation details.
- high-risk or broad changes: `challenger` runs after draft plan or diff to stress-test assumptions and residual risk.

Each specialist context pack must include only relevant files, hunks, logs, and questions. Do not give every specialist full task history. If specialist fan-out is unavailable, record in-main substitute in `<run-directory>/specialist-notes.md` and lower confidence when independence mattered.

### 07: Write `<run-directory>/development-notes.md` before running gates

Required sections:

- `Scope`
- `Acceptance Criteria`
- `Evidence`
- `Specialist Policy`
- `Gates`

### 08: Run shared quality gates

Inspect `python PLUGIN_ROOT/shared/run_gates.py --help`, then run all project-relevant gates with explicit commands or skip reasons.

### 09: Review the changed files and the gate output before deciding pass/fail

### 10: Classify findings using `../../shared/severity-map.md`

### 11: Record confidence evidence before the detailed final handoff

Write `<run-directory>/confidence-calibration.md` with these sections:

- `Initial Confidence`: starting score and concrete uncertainty sources.
- `Objective Evidence`: code paths read, tests/checks run, reproduction or acceptance evidence, and artifacts inspected.
- `Confidence Gaps`: missing evidence, unverified assumptions, risky substitutions, or unavailable checks.
- `Recovery Actions`: internal loops already performed to increase confidence, such as reading more source, running focused checks, adding/adjusting tests, consulting specialist policy, or reducing scope.
- `Recomputed Confidence`: final score after recovery, with why it is objectively supported.
- `Remaining Limits`: residual uncertainty and why it is acceptable or blocking.

Shared confidence policy:

Apply shared confidence band policy from `../../shared/quality-gates.md`. This skill records required evidence in `confidence-calibration.md` and mirrors it in `IMPLEMENT_METADATA.confidence_recovery` before output.

Confidence must be honest and objectively verifiable. Do not inflate it to pass gate; if evidence is missing, keep lower score and fail or time out with missing evidence named.

### 12: Write and validate the mandatory result artifact

Follow `../../shared/helper-cli-contract.md` and authoritative help. Write with `IMPLEMENT_METADATA`, validate as skill `implement`, and promote only validated candidate.

`IMPLEMENT_METADATA.confidence_recovery` must mirror `confidence-calibration.md` and include `initial_confidence`, `final_confidence`, `status`, `evidence`, `recovery_actions`, and `remaining_limits`. `IMPLEMENT_METADATA.confidence_gap_closures` must include one closure record per non-empty `confidence_gaps` entry, with `status=closed|unresolved|deferred` and matching evidence or rationale.

## Fail-fast Rules

01. Missing `goal` or `done_when` => fail.
02. Shared gate script missing => fail.
03. Any critical finding => fail.
04. Ambiguous scope or missing ownership => fail.
05. Missing failing doctest, pytest, or explicit acceptance check for changed behavior => fail.
06. `feature` mode without executable failing demo contract before production edits => fail.
07. Feature demo passes before implementation without explicit user override and re-scope note => fail.
08. Symptom-first task edited without `investigate` output or equivalent root-cause evidence => fail.
09. Workaround-only fix presented as completion without explicit temporary-mitigation instruction => fail.
10. Behavior-changing config/agent/skill edit without calibration/routing decision => fail.
11. Specialist-required domain change without specialist output or labeled substitute => fail.
12. Missing `development-notes.md` sections => fail.
13. Result artifact validator failure => fail.
14. Result artifact missing => fail.
15. New or materially changed function/method without purpose docstring in configured, established, or fallback project style => fail unless it is generated or third-party code explicitly outside edited ownership.
16. Non-trivial new or changed code block without explanatory inline comment => fail unless code was refactored until rationale is obvious from names and structure.
17. Explanatory inline comment placed directly above a new or changed `def`/`class` line, with no intervening blank line or code, => fail; move that explanation into docstring. A comment inside the function/class body is not this rule's target and stays governed by rule 16.
18. Long, dense, or deeply nested new/changed code block that could be split into clear helpers/classes or simplified with guard clauses => fail unless local project pattern requires structure.
19. Low-value tiny function/class that only remaps arguments, wraps one call without semantic purpose, or is rarely used => fail unless it materially improves readability, testability, or API stability.
20. Missing `confidence-calibration.md` sections => fail.
21. Shared confidence policy violation from `../../shared/quality-gates.md` => fail.

**Spike exemption**: rules 15-19 (docstring/structure) do not apply to `spike` mode output that stays a disposable, non-retained probe never merged into the codebase. When a spike is later promoted to retained implementation, rules 15-19 resume in full for the promoted code — the exemption does not carry over.

## Quality Gates

Required checks:

- `review`: `git diff --check`, changed-file inspection, acceptance criteria trace, simplicity/readability/reproducibility inspection, project docstring-style detection, and docstring/comment policy inspection for changed code.
- `tests`: failing-then-passing check or explicit acceptance probe for changed behavior; `feature` mode must include demo failure before edits and demo pass after implementation.
- `artifact`: shared validator confirms `development-notes.md`, gate logs, and result JSON shape.
- `confidence`: `confidence-calibration.md` and `IMPLEMENT_METADATA.confidence_recovery` satisfy shared confidence band policy from `../../shared/quality-gates.md`.

Conditional checks:

- `lint`/`format`/`types`: run project-configured commands when code or typed config changed.
- `calibration`: run when workflow skills, role/agent routing, `.codex/config.toml`, or calibration fixtures changed; Codex Rig source uses `runtime/calibration/run.py --layout plugin`.

## Calibration Hooks

Update calibration when implementation routing or output expectations change:

- benchmark patterns: `implement`
- behavioral cases: symptom-first routing, specialist substitution, config behavior changes, premature portable read-only adoption, missing acceptance probe, feature demo gate bypass, missing project docstring-style detection, missing function docstrings, overlong docstrings masking complex code, long code blocks not factored, deep branching without guard clauses, low-value argument-remapping wrappers, pre-definition comments that should be docstrings, missing explanatory inline comments, low-confidence recovery loop, objective confidence evidence, artifact validator bypass, spike output promoted to retained implementation without resuming docstring/structure rules 15-19

## Output Contract

Before writing result candidate, follow `../../shared/final-handoff-contract.md`: render and bind `final-handoff.json`, `final.md`, and `final-handoff.validation.json`; after both validators and promotion pass, emit `final.md` verbatim.

Use `../../shared/quality-gates.md`. Final chat follows its ordered frame. `Outcome` is `pass`, `fail`, `partial`, or `blocked` and states whether `done_when` was met. When multiple surfaces changed, `Results` uses exactly `Surface | Outcome | Verification | Remaining limit`. Apply shared `Verification`, `Remaining`, `Next steps`, and supplemental `Artifact` rules. `Confidence` also includes band, recovery actions, material gaps/degradation reasons, and closure status from `metadata.confidence_gaps` and `metadata.confidence_gap_closures`.

Minimum artifact payload template: `result-template.json`.
