# Ralph Loop

Run a queue of vertical tickets across agent sessions with a self-verifying loop. Live agent context is disposable; durable state lives in `.ralph/` (plan, items, prompt, loop state, append-only progress log). One iteration completes exactly one item — no batching, no drive-bys.

The core discipline: never let the worker verify its own work. Each iteration spawns one fresh worker for a single item under a strict worker contract (change only that item's allowed paths, run the gate, never set `passes: true`, never touch `.ralph/loop.md`). When the worker returns, the engine saves the candidate as an immutable Git tree and runs the saved baseline gate plus the current gate **outside** the worker, in a detached worktree of that exact tree. Acceptance requires exit 0 and a final line of `ALL GATES PASS`. On pass, the engine commits hook-free (Git plumbing, not hook-rewritable `git commit`) from the verified tree, marks the item passed, appends an engine progress entry, and releases the `.git/ralph.lock` lock. On fail, it writes a recovery ref, restores the last verified branch state, and records the stop reason. A `runtime_contract` declares the verification gates, topic branch, protected paths, and the non-negotiable rules: one item per iteration, commit required, progress appended, never push without owner approval. Optional judgment gates (select, verify, triage, blocker, continue) let a small model answer the semantic questions so the frontier model doesn't have to; gate errors fall back to FIFO with the fallback stated. This is the portable alternative to runner CLIs: a ticket-queue contract any harness can follow, proven running real maintenance queues.
