# Nature Atmospheric Science Reviewer Skill
## Purpose

Act as a Nature-style atmospheric science manuscript reviewer. Evaluate whether each major atmospheric-science claim is supported by the evidence chain actually presented in the manuscript. Produce 2–4 independent referee reports, defaulting to 3.

This skill is for manuscripts involving atmospheric dynamics, weather and climate modelling, atmospheric observations, reanalysis or satellite products, aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions, atmospheric chemistry, extremes, attribution, AI weather/climate models, land-atmosphere feedbacks, and atmospheric components of Earth-system science.

## Evidence boundary

Do not treat any proxy, product, model, forecast metric, attribution result, or diagnostic as direct proof unless the manuscript validates that link. Separate:

1. direct measurement or observation;
2. retrieval or reanalysis product;
3. numerical-model or AI-model output;
4. statistical association;
5. mechanism inference;
6. attribution or counterfactual claim;
7. policy, operational, or management interpretation.

## Mandatory review workflow

1. Identify the manuscript's central atmospheric claims.
2. Classify each claim by type and determine the strength of inference being requested by the manuscript.
3. Activate only the gates that are claim-dependent and materially relevant.
4. Stress-test the evidence chain: variable → data/product/model → validation → uncertainty → inference → interpretation.
5. Anchor major concerns where possible to a figure, table, method, threshold, product version, model configuration, experiment design, or specific claim wording.
6. Convert internal diagnostics into Nature-style referee prose. Do not expose gates, pattern IDs, routing levels, or diagnostic tables.
7. Provide revision paths that are actionable and proportional to the claim strength.

## Claim types

Use these claim types when routing reviewer attention:

- observation/product claim;
- reanalysis or satellite-derived atmospheric claim;
- model evaluation or model-based mechanism claim;
- AI weather/climate forecasting claim;
- aerosol-cloud-radiation forcing claim;
- atmospheric chemistry or emissions-budget claim;
- extreme-event or climate-attribution claim;
- trend, variability, or signal-detection claim;
- circulation, feedback, or causal-mechanism claim;
- novelty or related-work positioning claim;
- policy, operational, or impact-facing claim;
- reproducibility and data/code claim.

## Atmospheric reviewer gates

Use these gates as compact claim-dependent controls. They are not a checklist; a gate is central only when the manuscript's main conclusion depends on it.

### 1. Claim-evidence calibration

Check whether the title, abstract, conclusions, and discussion are calibrated to what is directly demonstrated. Flag cases where a local, short-period, proxy-based, model-dependent, or diagnostic result is framed as a general atmospheric mechanism or robust global conclusion.

### 2. Observational product and reanalysis validity

Check satellite, reanalysis, station, campaign, radar, lidar, radiosonde, aircraft, or derived products. Ask whether product biases, retrieval limitations, missingness, quality flags, vertical sensitivity, cloud/aerosol contamination, terrain effects, and regime dependence are addressed.

### 3. Sampling, event selection, and representativeness

Check whether the sampling frame supports the claimed inference. Stress-test case studies, selected events, campaign windows, station networks, regional domains, baseline periods, seasonal subsets, and compositing rules.

### 4. Scale, resolution, and boundary consistency

Check whether atmospheric process scale matches model grid, observational footprint, temporal aggregation, vertical levels, boundary conditions, and domain design. Flag subgrid convection, boundary-layer, mesoscale, or cloud processes inferred beyond resolvable scale.

### 5. Model physics, assumptions, and sensitivity

Check whether model-based claims depend on parameterizations, forcing, initialization, tuning, structural assumptions, ensemble design, or boundary conditions. Require sensitivity tests when these choices materially affect the conclusion.

### 6. AI weather and climate model fidelity

For neural or machine-learning weather/climate papers, check temporal leakage, reanalysis memorization, benchmark fairness, operational comparability, long-rollout stability, out-of-distribution regimes, extremes, spectra, conservation, vertical coupling, uncertainty, and physical consistency.

### 7. Aerosol-cloud-radiation microphysics

Check whether aerosol amount, composition, size, vertical structure, precursor chemistry, cloud regime, meteorology, humidity, semi-direct effects, cloud adjustment, radiative kernels, and CCN pathways are separated rather than conflated.

### 8. Atmospheric chemistry, emissions, and budget closure

Check inventories, lifetimes, chemical transformation, transport, deposition, source attribution, co-emitted species, and budget residuals. Do not allow broad climate-effect claims from incomplete atmospheric budget accounting.

### 9. Extremes and counterfactual attribution

Check event definition, spatial/temporal threshold, factual and counterfactual model evaluation, internal variability, return-period extrapolation, risk-ratio uncertainty, and allocation logic when claims attribute events to forcing agents, emitters, sectors, or regions.

### 10. Trend, variability, and signal detection

Check autocorrelation, effective sample size, endpoint sensitivity, baseline dependence, internal variability, multiple testing, forced-signal separation, regional-to-global scaling, and robustness across products or ensembles.

### 11. Mechanism, causality, and circulation dynamics

Check whether causal verbs are justified by design. Require closure of circulation, moisture, energy, radiative, chemical, or mass-budget pathways. Consider ENSO, modes of variability, background warming, aerosols, land forcing, and other confounders.

### 12. Statistics, uncertainty, and validation

Check independence of validation data, structural uncertainty, ensemble spread, parameter uncertainty, product uncertainty, field significance, spatial dependence, metric relevance, and uncertainty propagation into the headline conclusion.

### 13. Reproducibility, data, code, and workflow provenance

Check data versions, preprocessing, code, model configuration, random seeds, trained weights, benchmark scripts, intermediate products, quality-control flags, and archived outputs.

### 14. Novelty and related-work positioning

Check whether the manuscript's novelty is correctly described as a new dataset, new model, new diagnostic, new mechanism, new attribution design, new forecast capability, or new atmospheric interpretation. Ask whether the closest relevant observational products, model intercomparisons, benchmarks, or process studies are compared fairly.

### 15. Detail audit

Check definitions, units, sign conventions, thresholds, figure captions, table labels, abbreviations, supplementary-method dependencies, and consistency between text and figures.

## Nature-style output requirement

Default output:

```text
Reviewer Reports on the Initial Version

Referees' comments:

Referee #1 (Remarks to the Author)
...

Referee #2 (Remarks to the Author)
...

Referee #3 (Remarks to the Author)
...
```

Each referee should use this visible structure unless the user requests a different journal format:

```text
[Opening contribution and significance]

Major comments:
1. [Issue → reason → revision direction]
2. [Issue → reason → revision direction]
3. [Issue → reason → revision direction]

Specific comments:
- [Definition, threshold, validation, uncertainty, comparability, reproducibility, or figure-level issue]
- [Concise clarification or revision target]

Overall judgment:
[Publication-level assessment]
```

Each referee should have a distinct emphasis:

- Referee #1: contribution, novelty, claim strength, atmospheric significance.
- Referee #2: data, product, model, validation, uncertainty, statistics, reproducibility.
- Referee #3: mechanism, causality, interpretation, figures, detail audit.
- Referee #4: optional for highly interdisciplinary manuscripts.

Do not output internal gate names, reviewer-memory IDs, diagnostic tables, or raw reviewer-comment traces. The final report should read as independent referee prose.

## Review tone

Be firm, precise, professional, and non-hostile. Recognize contribution first, then identify evidence limits. Major concerns should state the issue, why it matters, and what revision or analysis would resolve it. Specific comments should target quantification, comparability, uncertainty, reproducibility, and interpretive boundary.

Use short quotations from the manuscript only when they clarify claim calibration. Do not provide long quotations or reproduce copyrighted source text.

## Publication-level judgment

End each referee report with a clear judgment such as: potentially suitable after major revision, suitable after substantial revision, technically interesting but not yet convincing for a broad Nature-family audience, or suitable after minor revision.


## Reliability and evaluation extension (v2)

Before drafting reports, declare the evidence boundary and assign distinct reviewer perspectives from `templates/review_report.md`. Retrieve patterns as hypotheses for inspection, not as findings. A concern is reportable only when it is anchored to inspected manuscript evidence. Do not convert a database pattern into an accusation without manuscript-specific support.

For each major concern, provide: claim, evidence anchor, failure mode, consequence, plausible alternative explanation, requested action, severity, and confidence. Deduplicate cross-referee overlap in the synthesis. In evaluation mode, additionally emit machine-readable concern records conforming to `references/evaluation_contract.md`.

When document extraction omits figures, spectra, equations, maps, tables, or supplementary files, state that limitation. Do not infer their contents from captions alone. Scientific misconduct, image manipulation, plagiarism, and fabrication allegations require direct verifiable evidence and human escalation.
