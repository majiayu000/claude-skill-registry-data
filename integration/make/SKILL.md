# Make (Integromat) — operate scenarios by REST API and MCP

Drive a live Make.com account from code or an agent: create scenarios from a
blueprint, activate/run/stop/clone/delete them, and manage the connections,
hooks, data stores, and teams around them. This skill owns the **operate**
half — the API v2 calls and the MCP wiring. It does **not** design the flow;
what a scenario *should do* (trigger, routes, mapping, dedup, error handler)
lives in [`automation-flows`](../automation-flows/SKILL.md), and the
Make-vs-n8n-vs-Zapier billing call lives in
[`automation-strategy`](../automation-strategy/SKILL.md). Bring the design
here, and this skill turns it into API payloads and MCP tool calls.

Reality up top (verify at author time — Make ships fast):

- **REST API v2 is GA.** Base URL is **zoned**: `https://{zone}.make.com/api/v2`.
- **The Make MCP server is GA and free on every plan** — you only pay the
  scenario **credits** a run consumes. Cloud MCP has two tool tiers: run tools
  (all plans) and management tools (paid).

## Connect first — API token vs MCP

Two ways in, chosen by *who is driving*:

- **REST API v2** — deterministic CRUD from your own scripts/CI. Full control
  of the blueprint. Use for provisioning, bulk edits, activate/stop pipelines.
- **Make MCP server** — lets an MCP client (Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT) call your
  scenarios and (on paid plans) manage them as tools, no glue code. Use when an
  **agent** is the operator.

`.env` (never inline secrets — read from the environment):

```bash
MAKE_ZONE=eu2.make.com        # your org's zone — eu1|eu2|us1|us2 (+ celonis). WRONG ZONE = AUTH ERROR.
MAKE_API_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx        # Profile → API/SDK → API token. Scopes are FIXED at creation.
MAKE_TEAM_ID=123456            # teamId a scenario is created under (integer)
MAKE_MCP_TOKEN=yyyyyyyy        # separate MCP token, for the token-URL MCP transport
```

**Auth header (API):** `Authorization: Token {MAKE_API_TOKEN}` — the literal
word `Token`, a space, then the token. OAuth2 is the alternative for
multi-user apps. **Scopes are chosen when the token is minted and cannot be
widened later** — mint with `scenarios:read scenarios:write` (and
`connections`, `hooks`, `datastores`, `teams` as needed) up front; a
too-narrow token means re-minting, not patching.

## The scenario model (just enough to build the payload)

A **scenario** = exactly one trigger module, then a chain of action modules,
optionally split by **routers** into branches. Data flows by **mapping**:
a downstream field references an upstream output as `{{2.email}}` (module 2's
`email`). The whole thing serializes to a **blueprint** — the JSON you GET, edit,
and POST back. That is the entire operate-side model you need here.

Do **not** design the flow in this skill. Trigger choice (webhook vs polling),
branch logic, idempotency/dedup on a data store, and the error handler
(Break → Incomplete Executions, etc.) are all `automation-flows`. Take its
build sheet, then encode it as a blueprint below.

## API v2 surface

| Group | Endpoints (case-sensitive!) | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Scenarios | `GET/POST /scenarios`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /scenarios/{id}`, `.../start`, `.../stop`, `.../run`, `.../clone`, `.../blueprint` | the core |
| Connections | `GET/POST /connections`, `.../{id}/test` | app auth the modules use |
| Hooks | `GET/POST /hooks`, `.../{id}/ping`, `.../learn-start` | inbound webhooks/mailhooks |
| Data stores | `GET/POST /data-stores`, `.../{id}/data` | dedup keys, state |
| Templates | `GET /templates`, `.../{id}/blueprint` | starting-point blueprints |
| Teams / Orgs | `GET /teams`, `GET /organizations/{id}` | scoping + rate limit |

Two rules that bite: **endpoints and query keys are case-sensitive**, and every
call is **zoned** — the same token against the wrong `{zone}` returns an auth
error, not a 404, which sends people chasing a token problem that does not exist.

**Rate limits are per plan** (req/min): Core 60 · Pro 120 · Teams 240 ·
Enterprise 1000. Read your own real ceiling rather than guessing:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Token $MAKE_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://$MAKE_ZONE/api/v2/organizations/$ORG_ID" | jq '.organization.license.apiLimit'
```

## Dynamic lifecycle — the blueprint round-trip

The core technique: **you rarely hand-write a blueprint.** You GET one from a
template or an existing scenario, mutate the JSON, and POST/PATCH it back **as a
string**. `blueprint` and `scheduling` are sent as JSON *strings*, not objects.

### 1. Get a starting blueprint

```bash
# From an existing scenario (or a template: GET /templates/{id}/blueprint)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Token $MAKE_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://$MAKE_ZONE/api/v2/scenarios/$TEMPLATE_ID/blueprint" \
  | jq '.response.blueprint' > bp.json   # wrapper key: verify .response.blueprint at author time
```

Mutate `bp.json` with your design — module parameters, the `{{n.field}}`
mappings, router filters. Keep secrets out; wire credentials via a
**connection id**, never a literal key in the blueprint.

### 2. Create the scenario (blueprint + scheduling as STRINGS)

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Token $MAKE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://$MAKE_ZONE/api/v2/scenarios" \
  -d "$(jq -n --argjson team "$MAKE_TEAM_ID" \
        --arg bp "$(jq -c . bp.json)" \
        --arg sched '{"type":"on-demand"}' \
        '{teamId:$team, blueprint:$bp, scheduling:$sched}')"
# scheduling e.g. {"type":"indefinitely","interval":900} (interval seconds) — verify fields at author time.
# optional: folderId, basedon (template id)
```

### 3. Validate

The create call itself is the validator — a malformed blueprint returns a 400
naming the offending module/field. Fix the JSON and re-POST. There is no
separate schema-lint endpoint; a clean create *is* the pass.

### 4. Dry-run / test before you schedule

Run it once, watching one execution, while still `on-demand` (inactive):

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Token $MAKE_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://$MAKE_ZONE/api/v2/scenarios/$ID/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"responsive":true}'
# inspect the returned execution/bundle output before trusting the flow
```

### 5. Activate

```bash
# switch scheduling off on-demand first (PATCH), then start
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Token $MAKE_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://$MAKE_ZONE/api/v2/scenarios/$ID/start"
```

### 6. Manage — patch, stop, clone

```bash
# Update: same round-trip — GET blueprint, mutate, PATCH back as a string
curl -s -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Token $MAKE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://$MAKE_ZONE/api/v2/scenarios/$ID" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg bp "$(jq -c . bp.json)" '{blueprint:$bp}')"

curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Token $MAKE_API_TOKEN" ".../scenarios/$ID/stop"
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Token $MAKE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ".../scenarios/$ID/clone" \
  -d '{"teamId": 999, "name": "copy"}'   # clone into another team
```

### 7. Delete — export first (irreversible)

`DELETE /scenarios/{id}` is permanent; there is no undo and no trash. **Never
delete a live scenario without exporting its blueprint first.**

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Token $MAKE_API_TOKEN" \
  ".../scenarios/$ID/blueprint" | jq '.response.blueprint' > backup-$ID.json  # export
curl -s -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Token $MAKE_API_TOKEN" ".../scenarios/$ID"
```

## Make MCP — run and manage scenarios as tools

The Make MCP server hands an MCP client your scenarios as callable tools. Two
transports:

- **OAuth (remote):** point the client at `https://mcp.make.com` (or the
  `/stream`, `/sse` variants). Scopes granted at consent decide which tools appear.
- **MCP token (per-zone):** `https://{zone}.make.com/mcp/u/{MCP_TOKEN}/stateless`
  (also `/stream`, `/sse`). `/stateless` times out at ~60 s; `/stream` and
  `/sse` allow ~5 min — a long scenario needs `/stream` or `/sse`.

Tool tiers (exact names move — confirm in the client's tool list at author time):

- **Run tools — all plans.** Enumerate on-demand scenarios and execute one with
  inputs, returning its output. This is what lets an agent *use* your automation.
- **Management tools — paid plans.** View/modify scenarios, connections, hooks,
  data stores, teams, organizations — the CRUD above, surfaced as tools.

Client config sketch (token transport):

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "make": {
  "url": "https://eu2.make.com/mcp/u/${MAKE_MCP_TOKEN}/stream"
} } }
```

MCP calls consume the scenario's normal **credits** — the server is free, the
runs are not. **Legacy note:** the local stdio server `integromat/make-mcp-server`
predates the cloud one and exposes on-demand scenarios as tools over stdio;
prefer the cloud server unless you specifically need a local process.

## Honesty / gotchas

- **Zone trap.** Wrong `{zone}` → auth error with a perfectly valid token. Check
  the zone before you suspect the token.
- **Case-sensitive paths.** `/scenarios` works, `/Scenarios` does not.
- **`blueprint` and `scheduling` are strings, not objects** — stringify them or
  the create/update fails.
- **Token scopes are frozen at creation.** Can't widen later; re-mint instead.
- **Delete is irreversible** — export the blueprint first, always.
- **Credits, not operations.** Make's billing unit became **credits** (was
  "operations"); API-triggered and MCP-triggered runs both burn them.
- **`.run` on an inactive scenario** is your dry run; scheduled execution needs
  `.start` — don't confuse the two.
- **Don't hand-author blueprints from scratch** — round-trip a template; the
  format is large and undocumented in full.

  (trigger, routes, mapping, dedup, error path). Build it there, encode the
  blueprint here. Design ↔ operate is the boundary.

## Checklist

- [ ] `MAKE_ZONE` matches the org's actual zone (ruled out the zone trap).
- [ ] API token minted with all scopes needed (scenarios + connections/hooks/
      datastores as required) — scopes can't be widened later.
- [ ] Blueprint obtained by round-trip (template/existing), not hand-written.
- [ ] `blueprint` and `scheduling` sent as JSON **strings**; `teamId` set.
- [ ] Credentials referenced by connection id — no secrets in the blueprint.
- [ ] Dry-ran with `/run` and inspected output before `/start`.
- [ ] Blueprint exported to a file before any `DELETE`.
- [ ] For MCP: right transport for run length (`/stream`|`/sse` if >60 s), and
      manager tools confirmed present only if the plan is paid.
